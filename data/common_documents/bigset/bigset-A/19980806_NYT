EXCERPTS FROM `GRAND CENTRAL WINTER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BC-HOMELESS-WRITER.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excerpts from ``Grand Central Winter,'' a memoir by Lee
Stringer:
</P>
<P>
   On First Smoking Crack:
</P>
<P>
   He removes a small wad of tin foil from his pocket and unwraps a
lima-bean-size nugget the color of cream. It makes a surprisingly
sharp CLICK when he drops it on the dish. A substantial sound. One
that will forever after divide two different points of time in my
life ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Age before beauty,'' he says ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearls before swine,'' I retort.
</P>
<P>
   I draw on the stem, and the bowl fills with a thick, swirling
cloud. I cannot feel the heat of the smoke as it goes down. But I
can taste it. It is a taste I know I am going to love. The taste of
success, love, orgasm, omnipotence, immortality and winning the
lottery all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   And then some.
</P>
<P>
   After the High
</P>
<P>
   Sadness and longing descend over me.
</P>
<P>
   Utter desolation hovers moments away.
</P>
<P>
   I am seized by a wave of panic.
</P>
<P>
   I want that party feeling back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Ed,'' I say, ``Those guys still out? Can we get more _
now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I dig into my pocket and hand him the first 50 of the more than
one hundred thousand dollars I will eventually smoke up before the
party really ends.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Emerald, a Fellow Addict
</P>
<P>
   I can't see her face _ she's standing, head stuck in the phone
booth, receiver to her ear _ but what I can see of her is in
perfect proportion and tantalizingly blond on top.
</P>
<P>
   Her hand shoots out, a cigarette daintily poised between her
fingers, and she's jiggling the thing to let me know she needs a
light. I walk over to her, fumbling in my pockets long enough to
take a good gander and she's almost breathtakingly good-looking:
all creamy homogenized lushness and beguiling emerald eyes _ a
glimmering spectacle against the drab, shuttered storefronts along
Ninth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   I light her up and she yanks a drag from the thing before she
turns and starts purring into the phone again, working away at a
wad of gum all the while as if she doesn't have a care in the
world, standing here in Hell's Kitchen at 2:30 in the morning,
crack dealers to the left, junkies to the right, sodden barhoppers
slouching along everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   I like that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a sucker for spunk.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S TWISTED DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   New York state's election laws are a national laughingstock, and
the state is infamous for the way in which candidates prefer to win
their races in court rather than at the polls. The public is inured
to the spectacle of little-known insurgents being dumped from the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally the system claims a celebrity victim, forcing
New Yorkers to confront the nuttiness of these laws. That happened
this week when Rep. Sue Kelly, a two-term Westchester County
Republican, was told she may be wiped off the ballot this fall
because her lawyers failed to number the pages on her list of
petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly's would-be Democratic opponent, Dick Collins, says
that Republicans frequently use technicalities to keep Democrats
off the ballot, and that he is using the same means to get rid of
Ms. Kelly. In other countries, this sort of thinking leads to
thousand-year wars. In New York it mocks the civic principle that
voters should be given the widest possible choice among candidates
who are given the fairest possible chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the state Board of Elections who reviewed Collins'
objections this week recommended that Ms. Kelly be disqualified for
want of those page numbers. That was not what the state Legislature
envisioned when it tried to clean up the ballot-access laws two
years ago, in hopes of ending the humiliating incidents in which
candidates were disqualified for oversights like using the wrong
color ink.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Legislature still has work to do. But while it
tidies up the existing laws, New York must also engage in a broader
debate about whether the system is simply too broken to be
repaired. Two-thirds of the states require nothing but a filing fee
for candidates to run for office. Some local election experts fear
that would lead to a flood of frivolous candidates who would clog
up an already confusing ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But that may turn out to be the only alternative to a system in
which people's urge to participate in the political process is
constantly being blocked by legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   State election laws should promote, not limit, voter choice. New
York's work the opposite way. In 1996 only Steve Forbes' large
private fortune let him overcome Republican leaders' determination
to give Bob Dole an automatic victory in the New York presidential
primary. Voters in Rep. Kelly's district may now fear that Collins
will be given a free pass into Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The full Board of Elections has yet to hear Ms. Kelly's case,
and she has plenty of money for legal appeals. But right now,
dozens of candidates for minor offices are being disqualified
because they cannot afford to pay the legal fees required to mount
a court fight. Witnesses who circulated petitions are being dragged
into court and terrified out of ever volunteering to work for a
candidate again.
</P>
<P>
   It is on that level that New York's democratic process is turned
into a mockery.

OUTDOORS: BIRDHOUSE LANDLORDS CATER TO RENT-FREE TENANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `s' code)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For six weeks last spring, beginning at precisely 4:30 a.m., a
strange sound would reverberate from an otherwise quiet
neighborhood in Columbus, N.J., a farming-community-turned-suburb
20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. Through the pre-dawn darkness,
and continuing for hours, the noise, an endlessly repeated
``cher-ch-cheer-cher,'' carried over manicured lawns and past newly
built homes.
</P>
<P>
   The sound grew especially loud around two enormous backyard
birdhouses mounted on poles. There, a small waterproof speaker
blared a recording of the ``dawn song'' of America's most sought
after song bird: the purple martin. Male martins use the song as a
vocal ``all's well'' and to perhaps attract a mate.
</P>
<P>
   For Jim Leedom, who had wired the speaker to the CD player in
his living room, it was just the beginning of a long initiation
into the semifanatical fraternity of martin ``landlords.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, purple martins _ the largest member of the
swallow family _ have shared a strong, mutual attraction with
humans. Ornithologists theorize this affinity began with native
Americans who hung hollow gourds as nesting cavities to attract the
birds to their villages. European colonists took this custom
another step by constructing ornate wooden houses with multiple
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the practice of housing martins has spawned its own
subculture of conservation societies, magazines, web pages and
merchandise catalogs selling everything from high-tech plastic
gourds with built-in, molded rain guards, to adjustable aluminum
dwellings that fetch several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The martins, in turn, have become so dependent that it is
generally believed they would become extinct in their range east of
the Rockies without human-supplied housing (the more solitary
western race still nests mostly in natural cavities).
</P>
<P>
   Leedom's indoctrination began last year when he heard martins
singing over his house as they migrated south. He spent the winter
studying their habits and come spring, had erected two houses and
two hanging gourds. Within weeks, a pair of martins reciprocated by
immediately calling one of his gourds home.
</P>
<P>
   As much as people have helped martins, we have also contributed
to their decline through the introduction of English sparrows and
European starlings in the 19th century. Both birds now out-compete
martins for nesting sites, and will often destroy eggs and young
birds. The human landlords of martins, for the most part a peaceful
lot, collectively see red when their houses are invaded by these
birds, which they have dubbed ``sky rats.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Leedom's house, I saw this firsthand when
three starlings landed on his lawn. Leedom quietly excused himself
and immediately returned with a pellet gun. Before he had a chance
to take a shot, the birds took off (like pigeons, neither species
are protected by conservation laws).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle if you're a responsible landlord,''
Leedom said. ``Martins get constantly harassed by the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides guns and early morning serenades, I quickly learned some
of the other extremes landlords go to just to keep their tenants
happy. Twice during nesting season, they lower their martin houses
and replace nests with clean materials to minimize parasites. Some
have rigged sprinklers to cool down the roofs of houses during heat
waves, while others have installed lamps to protect martins during
cold snaps. Landlords also commonly supply bowls of crushed
eggshells as a calcium supplement, or a dish of meal worms in the
early season when flying insects are still scarce.
</P>
<P>
   When Leedom's martins eventually produced a clutch of eggs, he
videotaped the nest and showed it off to his friends. He admits the
response was lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're crazy,'' he said. ``We're a group that,
among ourselves, seems very normal. But to everyone else we're
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   This solicitous behavior may have come to a head last June, when
the National Weather Service posted a tornado watch for this area.
According to Leedom, while his neighbors huddled in their
basements, he stood at his window throughout the storm staring at
his martin houses as 60-mile-an-hour winds ripped lawn furniture
from his patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had eggs and I'm waiting and waiting,'' he said. ``My
wife gave me a lot of grief for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But his birds survived and produced two young, which by late
July fledged in a matter of days. On this day in early July, he
lowered the house and showed them off like prize-winning tomatoes
from a backyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   The birds did their best to play dead, but couldn't help showing
their iridescent purple backs and narrow, pointed wings, which
would soon be used for mid-flight maneuvers to overtake and catch
flying insects.
</P>
<P>
   Leedom carefully hoisted the house back up. Within a minute, the
adult female swooped to the gourd with a plump dragonfly in her
beak and presented it to her young.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the dark, cobalt male took to soaring overhead. We
watched the martin adjust its tail like a rudder and glide over the
neighborhood, eventually disappearing behind the rooftops. &QL;

ACCUSATIONS HIT TURBODYNE AS SHARES TUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Turbodyne Technologies Inc. shares fell an
additional 16 percent Wednesday, one day after a New York
short-seller accused it of trying to cheat investors.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne shares dropped $1.625 to close at $8.375, with more
than 2 million shares changing hands, or about 2.5 times the
issue's six-month average daily volume. The company has lost half
of its value since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, New York-based short-seller Manuel Asensio initiated
coverage of Turbodyne with a ``strong sell'' recommendation, saying
in an accompanying release that Turbodyne has no valuable
technology. Asensio said Turbodyne management has purposely misled
investors about the value of its core technology ``in order to
defraud investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne President and Chief Executive Walter Ware said in a
written statement Wednesday that Asensio's charges were ``false and
misleading.'' In the company's first public response to the
charges, Turbodyne said it holds patents on six engine technologies
and has applied for patents on 19 more devices and technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said Turbodyne equipment has been
selected by a major European vehicle and engine manufacturer to be
included as standard equipment on three classes of buses being
manufactured for the 1999 model year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Asensio also said Turbodyne has raised and spent $55
million in equity capital but has failed to create any new
products, generate significant sales or turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this gross overvaluation combined with Turbodyne's
complete inability to generate any earnings per share will cause
the stock to fall to well below $1 per share,'' Asensio said.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Turbodyne lost $110,000 last year on sales of $27.7
million. So far in 1998, the company has lost $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Short-sellers like Asensio wager that a firm's stock will fall,
so they borrow shares, sell them and then replace the shares later
with ones they hope will be at a lower price. If the shares drop,
the trader can keep the difference.

ALLEGED POLICE BEATING VICTIM TO SUE UNION AS WELL AS OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who prosecutors
say was brutalized at a Brooklyn police station, has broadened his
planned civil lawsuit by adding the union that represents police
officers to the list of defendants, lawyers and others familiar
with the suit said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the lawsuit, which is expected to be filed today
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, will contend that the union _
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association _ is liable because it has
fostered police brutality in general by ``encouraging and
maintaining a blue wall of silence'' designed to protect officers
accused of brutality. The other defendants are the city, the Police
Department and the individual officers accused in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Louima's lawyers have said that the suit would seek a total of
$155 million in damages from the defendants, but from what others
familiar with the litigation said Wednesday, it appeared possible
that a figure might not be cited in the papers filed Thursday and
would be left unspecified until later in the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke Wednesday _ on condition of anonymity _ about
the planned lawsuit declined to say whether it would contend that
the policies or actions of the union specifically obstructed the
department's attempts to investigate Louima's charges that he was
tortured in the bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house in
Flatbush.
</P>
<P>
   It is said to be quite unusual for a police union to be named as
a defendant in a lawsuit charging police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the charges in the suit are to be made available at a
news conference today at the Manhattan offices of three of Louima's
lawyers, Johnnie Cochran, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck. Neufeld
declined Wednesday to discuss the suit. Another lawyer for Louima,
Sanford Rubenstein, did not return a call to his Brooklyn office.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement of the news conference said that the suit also
``seeks compensation from police officers who witnessed or were
aware of the events surrounding the beating of Louima,'' but no
details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Joseph
Mancini, said he would have no comment on reports that his group
would be named as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Louima, now 31, in a brawl outside a Flatbush
nightclub a year ago, has led to one of the most racially and
politically charged cases of alleged police brutality in New York
City in years.
</P>
<P>
   Four 70th Precinct officers have been indicted on federal
charges of violating Louima's civil rights. The four _ Justin
Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese _ are
accused of beating Louima in a police car on the way to the
precinct's station house. Volpe and Schwarz are also accused of
torturing him in the bathroom of the station house, Volpe by
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and then into his mouth,
inflicting severe internal injuries, and Schwarz by holding Louima
down.
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, has been charged with trying to
help the four cover up the beating.
</P>
<P>
   All five officers insist that the charges against them in the
criminal case, pending in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, are
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen Worth, asserted Wednesday that naming
the PBA as a defendant in Louima's civil suit was ``nothing more
than a cheap publicity stunt'' that ``has no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit reportedly contends, among other things, that the
so-called 48-hour rule has contributed to police brutality in the
city by helping implement blue walls of silence. The rule, part of
contracts negotiated between the union and the city since the early
1970s, says that officers accused of wrongdoing do not have to
answer the questions of Police Department investigators for two
full business days after the incident in question.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the rule outside the Police Department maintain it
gives officers involved in wrongdoing time to coordinate their
accounts or tamper with witnesses. But while police officials and
the Giuliani administration are seeking to eliminate the rule, they
also point out that it is irrelevant in such situations as the
Louima case, because in such instances officers retain the same
right as civilians not to be compelled to incriminate themselves.

FOR MARK RYPIEN, IT'S A HOME SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no world outside of Post Falls, Idaho, right now for
Mark Rypien. No world outside of his home, his family, his
3-year-old son, Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything now is about Andrew,'' said Rypien, the strapping
quarterback with the Super Bowl XXVI ring and MVP trophy; with
nearly 19,000 passing yards in his 13-year NFL career; and, don't
forget, a couple of good years left in his throwing arm. That's why
the Atlanta Falcons had signed him to a two-year deal this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rypien gave it back. The $1.8 million the Falcons had paid him.
The backup job in Atlanta that would have all but guaranteed some
of Rypien's autumn Sunday afternoons would have been spent flicking
off passes in the face of rushing linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is meaningless now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for us all to be together as a family. We want
his sisters to know their brother. Every day he's here, it's a
blessing to be together. You never know what could happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 20 years or more, the 35-year-old Rypien has spent
every August sweating under the summer sun, training for another
football season.
</P>
<P>
   High school football at Shadle Park in Spokane. College at
Washington State, where the fraternity of Cougar QBs keeps growing
more elite. And all those NFL camps in Washington, where he won the
Super Bowl, and St. Louis, where he learned just how soul-less a
business professional sports can be. The Rams let him walk away
even though the fans in St. Louis loved Rypien and the Rypiens
loved it in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But this August is different. Rypien is playing no football. In
fact it's the last thing on his mind, ever since he left Falcons
camp a month ago without a split-second of hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just called his agent and said, `There's no way I'm going
back,''' said Rypien's wife, Annette. ``He said, `There's no way
I'm walking out of this house.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, ever since July 2, after Andrew had suffered
another seizure _ one that let them know all their prayers and all
the agony of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment had not
done a shred of good to rid Andrew of his cancer _ Rypien knew what
had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would even think about doing anything different
doesn't have their priorities straight,'' the father of three said.
</P>
<P>
   And that conviction is why Mark Rypien and his wife have set up
another kind of camp at their home _ one that serves them all as a
cocoon and a retreat and, if not a place to heal, then as a place
where Andrew can live out whatever time is left in peace and love
and complete adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time complimenting each other, talking,
playing. Sometimes the girls (Amber, 7, and Angela, 9) get shafted.
But everything we're doing is about Andrew's quality of life,''
Rypien said. ``We want to keep that going. If there's a drastic
situation, we'll deal with it then.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there is no more science, no more invasive
modern medicine, no more trips to the hospital in Spokane, where
Andrew endured the machines, the needles, the careening blood
counts and radical procedures with more bravery than a grown man
could have shown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus is home and each other. When Andrew feels up
to it, the family rides into town to play at Chuck E. Cheese's, or
they head down to the river that rolls through the front of their
property to splash and swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, though, the sun seems to take more out of him. You can
see how drained he gets. Outside, the heat sends more pressure to
his brain, so we're staying inside more,'' Rypien said the other
day from his home in northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   This past Saturday, Rypien said his son complained of a
headache, too, so the father administered a dose of steroids to his
son, hoping it would alleviate the swelling enough to eliminate the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of that, we're trying for the highest quality of
life,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the glitch in his voice became evident, despite the elder
Rypien's bravery and stoicism. He is talking about Andrew's
prognosis, now that the tumor in the front left lobe of Andrew's
brain has come back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Andrew Rypien had his first seizure, which led
to the diagnosis of a brain tumor. There was surgery, chemotherapy
and later the doctors did what has rarely been done to a child as
young as Andrew: they planted radiation seeds in his brain, hoping
to devastate the tumor bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was on March 23,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the next 87 days, the radiation seeped into the
surrounding cells, and the doctors were hopeful the cancer had been
eliminated. But one week later, just one lousy week after the seeds
had died and just as Andrew celebrated his third birthday, the
tumor was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had tripled in size,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we were praying for recovery,'' Rypien said,
displaying his long-standing faith that has only grown stronger and
more precious, just as his love for his son has grown so deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it happens sometimes with families caring for a terminally
ill child, the Rypiens are the ones who offer strength, who see the
truth clearly and ask everyone to embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be sorry,'' is what Mark Rypien finds himself telling
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see us and say they are sorry, and I tell them you have
nothing to be sorry about. You didn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to know Andrew. We pray every day for a
miracle of healing, but if and when a time comes and he's not going
to be around, we want people to know they knew Andrew.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Rypiens' struggle all the more daunting is that,
in the middle of Andrew's illness, Annette was diagnosed with
cervical cancer. The doctors performed a hysterectomy, and
thankfully, as the cancer was detected in time, there was no need
for chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Annette was recovering from major surgery and being
given a clean bill of health, Andrew experienced that second
seizure. That was on June 19. Andrew was flown by helicopter back
to Spokane, cradled in Annette's arms despite how ill and sore she
was, as Mark Rypien made his way by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never justify or find a balance for this,'' Rypien
said of the duality of such good news about Annette and such
devastating news about Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really brought us back down to reality. And Annette felt
much worse. She felt, as I would, that maybe she was the sacrifice,
that maybe it was like saying it's your turn, now let's spare
Andrew,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rypiens had to face choices about how to proceed
with their son. The doctors at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane
sat down with the Rypiens and discussed the difficult scenarios,
which included more radical surgery that could have left Andrew
paralyzed or just as likely caused him to die on the operating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people are upset with us, and this was the hardest
thing we ever had to do. But I just told Mark, `God either wants
him or He doesn't.' So we just decided to let Andrew be Andrew,''
Annette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was out of respect to him. But I just said I cannot
do this. I cannot take him back to the hospital and watch him
hyperventilate, especially after everything we had already tried
had blown up in our faces and it came back so viciously, even after
using the strongest medications.''
</P>
<P>
   All that happened about six weeks ago. At that time, the doctors
gave Andrew as little as two months, which is why every day is
precious and why every day Andrew is home with his family, the
world feels a little more blessed and lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going about life as normal,'' Annette said, ``but we
just wanted to say thank you to everybody who has sent their
prayers and blessings. We have gotten so many cards and letters
from people all over the country. A lot of the letters, people
didn't even know our address. They just write to the postmaster and
asked if he could send the card or letter on to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some letters of prayer and hope and encouragement just say ``The
Rypiens. Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling to know how many lives that Andrew has
touched, from Washington to St. Louis to Atlanta. There has been
such an outcry of support,'' Mark Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has given us such a big boost, feeling others are out there
who care and who are praying as much as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rypiens are all home together, but hardly home alone.

BLADES ENJOYING SMALLER ROLE WITH SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ In the past few months, Brian Blades has seen
his role in the Seahawks' offense diminished significantly and his
salary reduced even more.
</P>
<P>
   He also has had to watch the forced retirement of his brother,
strong safety Bennie Blades, because of bulging discs in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was celebrating his 33rd birthday two weeks ago by
practicing twice in 99-degree heat at the team's Eastern Washington
University training camp.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the veteran wide receiver smiling so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a great time out here this year,'' Blades says.
</P>
<P>
   Make that a really great time, Blades' body language adds.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the twilight of Blades' productive career, but he
has big plans for his 11th season.
</P>
<P>
   Blades is in better shape than he has been since 1994,
physically and mentally. He has lost a step, but now uses cunning
and quick wits to continue getting open and catching the ball as
well as ever. And, he's having fun again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is to have fun,'' Blades said. ``I'm toward
the end of my career, and I know that. One thing I also know is
that I can still play this game. So I'm just going to have fun with
whatever I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun isn't exactly the word that describes Blades' life the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   After setting club records with 80 and 81 receptions in 1993 and
1994, the injuries that accumulate from years of making tough
catches over the middle reduced Blades' numbers, playing time and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Blades accidentally shooting and killing his
cousin, Charles Blades, in July 1995 plunged him into a personal
hell. A jury convicted him of manslaughter, but the judge
subsequently overturned the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Blades never will forget that tragic night in Florida, but he
has learned to cope with the loss of his best friend and has put
behind him the seemingly endless legal proceeding that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, he's changed this camp,'' offensive
coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``I think the emotional strain of
what he's been through wore on him physically the last few years.
He's to the point now where he's recovered from that. Mentally,
he's probably a little more at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Blades still couldn't talk about his cousin without
tears coming to his eyes. He was sullen and withdrawn. The team's
signing of Bennie in free agency gave Brian a shoulder on which to
lean, and at times even cry.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie is Brian's younger brother, but he's larger and more
gregarious. So Bennie's presence also cast a large shadow that
Brian either didn't want to or couldn't elude. Now Bennie is gone,
just another reminder of how quickly an NFL career can end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard on me,'' Blades said. ``It was hard seeing
Bennie go through what he went through during the offseason and
what he went through at the end of last season. I gave him all the
love and support I could. When it came down to the decision of
whether he should try to play this year or hang them up, I gave him
my honest opinion as far as life after football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a discussion Blades admits having while looking into the
mirror, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why he is still out here competing against players who were in
junior high school when Blades broke into the league as a
second-round draft choice in 1988? Why agree to a pay cut to the
NFL minimum of $325,000? Why accept a demotion to the No. 4
receiver behind Joey Galloway, Mike Pritchard and James McKnight?
What's left to prove for the player who has caught more passes
(566) than any player in club history besides Hall of Famer Steve
Largent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to this season. I'm looking forward to
doing whatever I can to help this ballclub get back to where it was
when I first got here,'' Blades said.
</P>
<P>
   Blades is the final bridge to where the Seahawks once were and
where they want to be again _ the playoffs. The last time this team
played in the postseason was during Blades' rookie season. Since
then, he has survived two coaching changes, an ownership change and
the attempted move of the franchise to Southern California. Blades
also has endured the past seven years, when the Seahawks have not
had one winning season, while compiling a 44-68 record and watching
their fan base dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, it was great,'' Blades said. ``The fans
were great. The Kingdome was always crowded. That's why I'm looking
forward to this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Bratkowski is just glad to still have
Blades around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here so long he wants to see that great year that's
hanging out there on the edge,'' Bratkowski said. ``He wants to be
a part of that. He said he'll cover kicks or do whatever he has to
to be a part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   That from a player who already has been so much a part of this
team's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask for more than Brian Blades has done for this
team,'' Bratkowski said. ``Or is willing to do for this team.''

`WHOPPER' WHO GOT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ So this is how The Disney Co. goes about
evening the score. Not on the scoreboard but in the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after pitcher Carlos Perez slips through the fingers
of the Disney-owned Angels and into the laps of the Fox Group-owned
Dodgers, Disney offers the NHL a Kingdom's ransom for league
broadcasting rights once the current Fox contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this latest ``Disney on Ice'' production carries a
$400 million price tag, you'd think there'd be a movement underfoot
to assemble something a little more entertaining for the hockey
fans at home than a No.1 defensive pairing of Jason Marshall and
Pavel Trnka, which is what the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim boasted at
the close of the 1997-98 season. And yet, over the summer, all
that's changed are the dates on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney-owned Ducks so far have shown remarkable financial
restraint, refusing to pay any free agent on ice twice what they
deem he's worth.
</P>
<P>
   And how much more is the Disney bid than what Fox forked out,
you ask? Roughly double, proving that fiscal responsibility is as
adaptable as baseball's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   That said, tight pockets are not what landed the Angels in
another too-snug-for-comfort pennant race. If the Angels happen to
miss the playoffs again this year, as they have the previous 11,
it'll be because of the deal they didn't make a year ago, not any
they failed to consummate before this past Friday's trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were right to hold on to the likes of infielder Troy
Glaus and left-handed starter Scott Schoeneweis when all impatience
broke loose. To mortgage the farm, as the Dodgers so foolishly have
done by trading three of their four best prospects, is the way to
salvage a season, maybe. But it's ultimately destructive to the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Time remains on the Angels' side, though you have to wonder
where they'd be today if they hadn't let slugger Mark McGwire slip
through their fingers like sand in an hour glass.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was being offered by the Oakland Athletics before
the 1997 trading deadline, the Angels were prepared to make a deal.
It seemed like a no-brainer, what with McGwire having made it clear
he'd like to play near his son, who lives in Huntington Beach with
McGwire's ex-wife and her second husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offered Oakland outfielder Jim Edmonds and
left-handed pitcher Jarrod Washburn. They also requested permission
to talk to McGwire's agent so they could get a feel for their
prospects of re-signing the superstar free-agent-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics, not eager to lose McGwire to a division rival,
anyway, balked. OK, countered Angels general manager Bill Bavasi,
then how about throwing in third baseman Scott Brosius as a
consolation prize in the event McGwire should walk after the
season's end?
</P>
<P>
   No way, said the Athletics. At which point Bavasi should have
counted to 61, if that's what it took, then found a way to make the
deal happen. How often, after all, is the next coming of Babe Ruth
up for grabs like a home run ball?
</P>
<P>
   Oakland could have been counted on to provide more opposition
than McGwire, for whom the 18-mile commute to the ballpark from his
offseason home in Huntington Harbour and a more constant
relationship with his 10-year-old child would have been no small
enticement to stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Angels dropped out of the bidding and the first
baseman went to St. Louis for a song (pitchers T.J. Mathews, Eric
Ludwick and Blake Stein). A year later, McGwire is chasing history
while the Angels are trying desperately not to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, they led the American League West by 3{ games. Today
they are a 1{ games behind the Texas Rangers who, wisely or no,
traded away a good chunk of their future last week with an eye
toward gunning down another Angels postseason run right now.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels can't hold off all challengers this time, it'll
mark the third time in four seasons that they've made like home
base and let someone trample all over them.
</P>
<P>
   A so-called full house witnessed the Angels' 6-5 loss to
Cleveland Wednesday afternoon. It was their sixth announced
capacity crowd of the season. With McGwire's bat in the lineup,
they surely would have had at least that many during their
just-completed nine-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with McGwire as a draw, the Angels probably could have
augmented their 45,050 capacity by instituting festival seating on
the fake green hillside on either side of the plastic rock
formation of the redesigned and renamed Edison Field. With McGwire
an everyday presence, the stadium really would have been electric.
Every game would have been the Fourth of July, especially with
every Angels home run duly celebrated with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire chasing Roger Maris' single-season home run record,
Angels fans might not have noticed all the beach balls and bleached
blondes.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire in an Angels uniform there would have been no need
to designate Cecil Fielder for assignment, as the Angels did
Wednesday; the designated hitter would have been someone else's
extra baggage from the season's start.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind filling McGwire's shoes. ``I know I haven't exactly
been myself in my four months here,'' a disappointed Fielder
admitted on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels shouldn't cry over Fielder or the Perezes and Todd
Stottlemyres and Mike Piazzas that got away last week. Those are
small fish compared to the whopper that was theirs to reel in last
year.

MARINERS SAY THEY STILL COULD MAKE A DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As the Randy Johnson trade backlash subsides, Mariner
executives are perusing the major league waiver wire, plotting ways
to improve the team both short- and long-term.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last Friday's trade deadline, when the Mariners sent
Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers _ pitcher
Freddy Garcia, infielder Carlos Guillen and a player to be named
later _ post-deadline trades still can occur.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules are different.
</P>
<P>
   After the deadline, a player can't be traded unless he has
passed through waivers, a process in which all teams are notified
that the player is available for trade, and teams in reverse order
of win-loss records have priority.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a player through waivers has become increasingly
difficult for two reasons: the wild-card playoff spot has meant
more teams are competing for postseason berths and a general
manager of a contending team can ``block'' a potential competitor
from acquiring a certain player.
</P>
<P>
   The latter practice was not used often until three years ago
when Denny Neagle was placed on waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates,
went unclaimed, and then was traded to the Atlanta Braves in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' Chicago Cubs general manager Ed Lynch told
Sports Illustrated, ``it got harder to get people through. Now it
seems every left-handed pitcher alive is claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the chances of making a trade reduced, Woody Woodward, the
Mariner vice president of baseball operations, is looking at other
options to help a team that is 10 1/2 games out of first place
going into Thursday's road-trip opener against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can do some things here in August to help our situation,
then we will,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``Woody hasn't closed up
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Woodward: ``Right now, we are taking some time to evaluate
the players we got in the (Johnson) trade, looking at other
(minor-league) players we might bring up when rosters are expanded
(Sept. 1) and also looking at the waiver wire to see if players
clear. We still may be able to make a trade, but we'll take a
harder look at trades and the free agent market during the
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Johnson trade chopped about $2 million off the
payroll, it is unlikely the M's will use it to re-sign a
high-salaried pitcher to replace the left-hander this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for younger players with major league
experience,'' Woodward said. ``We're not looking for high-salaried
players. I would never say never in this situation, but that is not
really the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even more unlikely that other key Mariner players will be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Johnson trade and reaction to it from several
players, Woodward had a meeting Sunday at the Kingdome with
pitchers Jamie Moyer and Jeff Fassero, outfielders Ken Griffey Jr.
and Jay Buhner and infielders Alex Rodriguez and David Segui to
assure them a fire sale isn't in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody called the meeting to let them know we are not
dismantling the team,'' said Lee Pelekoudas, the vice president of
baseball administration. ``We hope the nucleus will be here for
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't certain when the players acquired from Houston will
join the M's. Garcia, a right-handed starter, made a solid debut
with Class AAA Tacoma Tuesday night (allowing one run in seven
innings in a 2-1 win against Memphis). Guillen, a shortstop with
the Class AAA New Orleans Zephyrs, has been moved to second base
with the Rainiers, presumably as Joey Cora's eventual replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Although club officials from both the Mariners and Astros
haven't announced the third player in the Johnson deal, there has
been speculation that it is John Halama, a left-handed pitcher who
had a 13-3 record at New Orleans last season and is 8-2 with a 3.33
ERA this season.

<P>
   He has been sidelined since July 9 with a strained tendon in his
left elbow and is scheduled to pitch Thursday in Salt Lake City.
Among other possibilities, according to a source close to the
Zephyrs, are switch-hitting catcher Mitch Meluskui from Yakima and
infielder Daryle Ward, son of ex-big-leaguer Gary Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Pelekoudas said there are several reasons a player is to be
named later: an injury, roster problems (no room on the 40-man
roster), or the player must clear waivers. Pelekoudas wouldn't
specify why the deal hasn't been completed and when it will be
consummated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's called `player to be named later,' '' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   According to a major league rule revised last season because of
interleague play, any such player must be a minor-leaguer.
Previously, a player to be named could be a major leaguer from the
other league.

FOR MARK RYPIEN, IT'S A HOME SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no world outside of Post Falls, Idaho, right now for
Mark Rypien. No world outside of his home, his family, his
3-year-old son, Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything now is about Andrew,'' said Rypien, the strapping
quarterback with the Super Bowl XXVI ring and MVP trophy; with
nearly 19,000 passing yards in his 13-year NFL career; and, don't
forget, a couple of good years left in his throwing arm. That's why
the Atlanta Falcons had signed him to a two-year deal this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rypien gave it back. The $1.8 million the Falcons had paid him.
The backup job in Atlanta that would have all but guaranteed some
of Rypien's autumn Sunday afternoons would have been spent flicking
off passes in the face of rushing linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is meaningless now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for us all to be together as a family. We want
his sisters to know their brother. Every day he's here, it's a
blessing to be together. You never know what could happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 20 years or more, the 35-year-old Rypien has spent
every August sweating under the summer sun, training for another
football season.
</P>
<P>
   High school football at Shadle Park in Spokane. College at
Washington State, where the fraternity of Cougar QBs keeps growing
more elite. And all those NFL camps in Washington, where he won the
Super Bowl, and St. Louis, where he learned just how soul-less a
business professional sports can be. The Rams let him walk away
even though the fans in St. Louis loved Rypien and the Rypiens
loved it in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But this August is different. Rypien is playing no football. In
fact it's the last thing on his mind, ever since he left Falcons
camp a month ago without a split-second of hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just called his agent and said, `There's no way I'm going
back,''' said Rypien's wife, Annette. ``He said, `There's no way
I'm walking out of this house.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, ever since July 2, after Andrew had suffered
another seizure _ one that let them know all their prayers and all
the agony of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment had not
done a shred of good to rid Andrew of his cancer _ Rypien knew what
had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would even think about doing anything different
doesn't have their priorities straight,'' the father of three said.
</P>
<P>
   And that conviction is why Mark Rypien and his wife have set up
another kind of camp at their home _ one that serves them all as a
cocoon and a retreat and, if not a place to heal, then as a place
where Andrew can live out whatever time is left in peace and love
and complete adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time complimenting each other, talking,
playing. Sometimes the girls (Amber, 7, and Angela, 9) get shafted.
But everything we're doing is about Andrew's quality of life,''
Rypien said. ``We want to keep that going. If there's a drastic
situation, we'll deal with it then.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there is no more science, no more invasive
modern medicine, no more trips to the hospital in Spokane, where
Andrew endured the machines, the needles, the careening blood
counts and radical procedures with more bravery than a grown man
could have shown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus is home and each other. When Andrew feels up
to it, the family rides into town to play at Chuck E. Cheese's, or
they head down to the river that rolls through the front of their
property to splash and swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, though, the sun seems to take more out of him. You can
see how drained he gets. Outside, the heat sends more pressure to
his brain, so we're staying inside more,'' Rypien said the other
day from his home in northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   This past Saturday, Rypien said his son complained of a
headache, too, so the father administered a dose of steroids to his
son, hoping it would alleviate the swelling enough to eliminate the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of that, we're trying for the highest quality of
life,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the glitch in his voice became evident, despite the elder
Rypien's bravery and stoicism. He is talking about Andrew's
prognosis, now that the tumor in the front left lobe of Andrew's
brain has come back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Andrew Rypien had his first seizure, which led
to the diagnosis of a brain tumor. There was surgery, chemotherapy
and later the doctors did what has rarely been done to a child as
young as Andrew: they planted radiation seeds in his brain, hoping
to devastate the tumor bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was on March 23,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the next 87 days, the radiation seeped into the
surrounding cells, and the doctors were hopeful the cancer had been
eliminated. But one week later, just one lousy week after the seeds
had died and just as Andrew celebrated his third birthday, the
tumor was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had tripled in size,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we were praying for recovery,'' Rypien said,
displaying his long-standing faith that has only grown stronger and
more precious, just as his love for his son has grown so deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it happens sometimes with families caring for a terminally
ill child, the Rypiens are the ones who offer strength, who see the
truth clearly and ask everyone to embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be sorry,'' is what Mark Rypien finds himself telling
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see us and say they are sorry, and I tell them you have
nothing to be sorry about. You didn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to know Andrew. We pray every day for a
miracle of healing, but if and when a time comes and he's not going
to be around, we want people to know they knew Andrew.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Rypiens' struggle all the more daunting is that,
in the middle of Andrew's illness, Annette was diagnosed with
cervical cancer. The doctors performed a hysterectomy, and
thankfully, as the cancer was detected in time, there was no need
for chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Annette was recovering from major surgery and being
given a clean bill of health, Andrew experienced that second
seizure. That was on June 19. Andrew was flown by helicopter back
to Spokane, cradled in Annette's arms despite how ill and sore she
was, as Mark Rypien made his way by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never justify or find a balance for this,'' Rypien
said of the duality of such good news about Annette and such
devastating news about Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really brought us back down to reality. And Annette felt
much worse. She felt, as I would, that maybe she was the sacrifice,
that maybe it was like saying it's your turn, now let's spare
Andrew,'' Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rypiens had to face choices about how to proceed
with their son. The doctors at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane
sat down with the Rypiens and discussed the difficult scenarios,
which included more radical surgery that could have left Andrew
paralyzed or just as likely caused him to die on the operating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people are upset with us, and this was the hardest
thing we ever had to do. But I just told Mark, `God either wants
him or He doesn't.' So we just decided to let Andrew be Andrew,''
Annette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was out of respect to him. But I just said I cannot
do this. I cannot take him back to the hospital and watch him
hyperventilate, especially after everything we had already tried
had blown up in our faces and it came back so viciously, even after
using the strongest medications.''
</P>
<P>
   All that happened about six weeks ago. At that time, the doctors
gave Andrew as little as two months, which is why every day is
precious and why every day Andrew is home with his family, the
world feels a little more blessed and lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going about life as normal,'' Annette said, ``but we
just wanted to say thank you to everybody who has sent their
prayers and blessings. We have gotten so many cards and letters
from people all over the country. A lot of the letters, people
didn't even know our address. They just write to the postmaster and
asked if he could send the card or letter on to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some letters of prayer and hope and encouragement just say ``The
Rypiens. Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling to know how many lives that Andrew has
touched, from Washington to St. Louis to Atlanta. There has been
such an outcry of support,'' Mark Rypien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has given us such a big boost, feeling others are out there
who care and who are praying as much as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rypiens are all home together, but hardly home alone.

LEADERLESS DODGERS CONTINUE STRUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Los Angeles Dodgers didn't need Gary Sheffield
and Raul Mondesi. They needed Kirk Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   They needed what the team has been lacking during all the
September meltdowns and all the summer slumber parties like
Wednesday's 5-1 loss to the lowly Montreal Expos in front of 9,611
at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to say this is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers were content with saying it was tough
playing without the suspended Sheffield and later Mondesi, who left
the game early with more lower- back pain.
</P>
<P>
   Tough is being 30 games out in early August like the Expos.
Tough is hearing there might not even be a team in Montreal in a
few years. Tough is fans back in L.A. knowing that the Dodgers are
underachieving again.
</P>
<P>
   Tough is not being only 5{ games back in the wild-card race,
even after losing for the second consecutive night to a far lesser
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bobby Bonilla appeared to address the problem. Playing
for the first time since July 15 (sprained left wrist), Bonilla
returned to a down team. He was brought to the Dodgers to replace
the reluctant Mike Piazza as clubhouse leader but later implied the
only trouble with this team lies in the absence of Sheffield and
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is every big-league team has a chance to kick
your butt if you're not prepared to play them,'' said Bonilla, who
singled in the sixth and hit the ball hard twice in four at-bats.
``Obviously, we're not prepared. Either you come in with the eye of
the tiger or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Gibson brought the Dodgers during the 1988
championship season. He not only won the National League Most
Valuable Player award, he dragged passive players like Mike
Marshall and Jeff Hamilton into playing well with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare skill. Within three years, Gibson was broken down
and off the team. But if fired general manager Fred Claire never
works another day in his life, he always can smile about that
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hoping Mondesi could step up and fill the
leadership role. He is the most energized player on this team. But
now he is hurt again. On this 10-game trip, Mondesi has missed two
games altogether and left three others early because of back
trouble. He will see a doctor in Los Angeles on Friday to determine
the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman didn't second-guess himself for
sending Mondesi out despite the obvious pain. Mondesi, who leads
the team with 25 homers, reinjured his back sliding into second
with a first-inning double. Hoffman is desperate to jump-start this
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we could get him warmed up and loose he might be
OK,'' Hoffman said. ``He gave it all he could, but he was
tightening up and we knew we had to get him out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who is serving a three-game suspension for his
involvement in the June 28 fight with Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall,
will be back Friday. He is the club leader with a .312 average and
75 RBI. Maybe he could have helped figure out Montreal's rookie
starter Carl Pavano (4-5), who pitched six scoreless innings to
lower his earned-run average to 4.59.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield probably would have had no control over Eric
Karros making outs to end four innings and stranding four base
runners. And could Sheffield have helped Darren Dreifort (6-10)
avoid walking five batters, including three in the sixth inning,
when the Expos increased their lead to 4-0?
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Dreifort's only mistake was a two-run double by
Scott Livingstone in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth, however, had an ominous beginning when Dreifort
opened by walking former teammate Wilton Guerrero. It was just
Guerrero's fifth walk in 215 at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   And it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick May followed with a single and Vladimir Guerrero scored
his brother with a slow roller to third that Adrian Beltre could
only stand and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort appeared out of trouble when Livingstone grounded into
a double play, but May moved to third and scored on a passed ball
by Tom Prince with Ryan McGuire at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like there was more pressure on me tonight
because guys were out,'' said Dreifort, who has just one victory in
his last seven starts. ``We'll be all right.''

   MONTREAL _ Raul Mondesi left Wednesday's 5-1 loss to Montreal
with more soreness in his lower back and will not play today's
series finale against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that after Tuesday's game but played anyway. Before
the game he could barely walk, then reinjured his back sliding into
second on a first-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very painful right now,'' Mondesi said after the game.
``I won't be playing (today). We have to get this figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing keeping the Los Angeles Dodgers from a full panic
is that Mondesi's problem is in the muscles and not a disc, which
is far more difficult to mend. Mondesi will be examined Friday by
the club's back specialist, Dr. Robert Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to take the ball out of his hand right now,''
said manager Glenn Hoffman. ``We knew how he was before the game,
but he wanted to play. This time he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has missed two games and left three others early on the
Dodgers' 10-game East Coast trip. His latest problems came on the
day Bobby Bonilla returned after missing 20 games with a pain in
his surgically repaired left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla started in left, with Matt Luke moving to right field.
During a sixth-inning double switch, Bonilla moved to third base.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Dodgers planned to send down rookie
third baseman Adrian Beltre to make room for Bonilla. But general
manager Tom Lasorda, who is back in Los Angeles, called Hoffman in
the manager's office and told him infielder Alex Cora was being
sent back to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had a second-inning double Wednesday but has not hit
well. He turned 20 in April and, like many rookies, has had trouble
with breaking balls away.
</P>
<P>
   But Luke, another rookie who has been getting most of the
playing time in left, has gone just 3 for 26 on the trip and might
be getting a little overexposed. By sending down Cora, who went 4
for 30 in 24 games with the Dodgers, Bonilla goes back to left.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said he was ready to go before Wednesday's game. He had
an excellent batting practice session on Tuesday and awoke the next
day without pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna finish out this season, go home and rehab and come
back really strong next year,'' said the always bubbly Bonilla.
``My hand feels very good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Once upon a time: This is Hoffman's first visit to Olympic
Stadium since he was traded to the Dodgers from Boston in August
1987. Hoffman, then a shortstop, arrived only to learn he had not
cleared waivers and was forced to wait three days before he could
be activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't supposed to be with the team until I cleared
waivers,'' Hoffman said. ``But I just holed up in the clubhouse
until the whole thing blew over.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Day off: With a day game today, catcher Charles Johnson was
given Wednesday off. It is the third day off on this trip for
Johnson, who missed the July 28 game in Philadelphia when his wife
had a baby in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard Mondy was going to play, I thought I could sneak
a day off for C.J.,'' Hoffman said. ``Then Mondy was gone and
without C.J. we didn't have a lot of pop in there. We have a few
days coming up, so he will be in there every day for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Prince started and went 0 for 4. He singled and scored the
winning run as a pinch hitter Friday but went hitless in 12 at-bats
in those three starts.

DRUG RAID ON HELL'S ANGELS YIELDS NO DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a drug bust gone bust.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 FBI agents and 9th Precinct detectives pried their
way into the Hell's Angels clubhouse in the East Village on
Wednesday night, working on a tip that narcotics were being sold in
the motorcycle club.
</P>
<P>
   But when the authorities arrived, they found no illegal drugs _
nothing illegal, in fact, except a pair of unregistered handguns,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do was knock,'' one gang member said.
</P>
<P>
   Four members were arrested: one on an assault charge, two on
outstanding robbery charges, and another on a charge of criminal
possession of the weapons, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse at 75{ E. Third St. _ actually incorporated under
New York state law as a religious nonprofit organization and
formally known as the Church of Angels _ has been at that address
for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, chapter president ``Big'' Vinnie Girolamo was charged
with throwing his girlfriend to her death from the clubhouse roof.
He died before his day in court. Then the club was shut down for a
time in 1985 after a cocaine and methamphetamine raid.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, as police had the block cordoned off for the
raid, Ronald Kuby, a lawyer who has defended some gang members
before, denounced the raid as harassment and said the authorities
were running a ``police state.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors insisted that the bikers kept the area clean and
sober.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good neighbors,'' said Caren Goldstein, 32. ``They're
very peaceful and they protect the block. I feel safe here.''

PHYSICAL LaFLEUR ADDS DIMENSION FOR COWBOYS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ After catching a pass in Friday's
preseason game against the Seahawks, Dallas Cowboys tight end David
LaFleur hurled his 6-foot-7, 280-pound frame into Seattle safety
Darryl Williams to finish a 26-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (6-0, 202) certainly won't forget it. And if LaFleur
has his way, defensive backs across the NFL soon will get the same
message.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a calling card of sorts for the big tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like \Rdelivering a hard hit\S,'' said LaFleur, the Cowboys'
first-round pick in 1997. ``I'm not going to run away from anybody,
so the best thing I can do is run over somebody. That's pretty much
what they can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur's bronc-busting ways are a departure from the finesse
play of recent Cowboys tight ends Jay Novacek and Eric Bjornson.
But the style seems to suit Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who inserted
LaFleur into the starting lineup ahead of Bjornson because he
believes LaFleur is perfect for the Cowboys' new offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey said LaFleur would have to take a huge leap in
development from his rookie year, when he caught only 18 passes,
for the offense to reach its full potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tight end is very important to our football team as a run
blocker and a pass catcher,'' Gailey said. ``David's development is
very important to our football team. We'll need him to make a good
jump from last year for us to be effective on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said LaFleur stepped up against Seattle. In addition to
the reception, LaFleur made an impact in the running game by
throwing a key block during Chris Warren's 15-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons everyone talks about him being a
prototype tight end,'' Cowboys tight end coach Les Miles said.
``He's big, he's strong, he has good hands. I think it's warranted
when people suggest he could be as good as there is.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur began to emerge near the end of the 1997 season when he
started three of the last four games in place of an injured
Bjornson. Eleven of his receptions came during that time, including
a three-catch, two-touchdown performance against the Bengals in
Week 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I showed in that game what I'm capable of doing,''
LaFleur said. ``I was put in a good situation, and I was able to
make some plays. I think I can make some plays to help this team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey agrees. And while the Cowboys four- and five-receiver
sets have been the subject of much talk during training camp,
Gailey said the Cowboys will get the ball into LaFleur's big hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey wouldn't guess any season reception totals for LaFleur,
but he almost guaranteed that the second-year player would have
more receptions than the 18 caught last season by Steelers tight
end Mark Bruener when Gailey was his offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do everything I can to help us win,'' LaFleur
said. ``Whether that's catch 20 balls and go to the Super Bowl or
60 balls and go to the Super Bowl. It doesn't worry me. But the
tight ends will have some balls in this offense.''
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the Seattle game, if LeFleur can get the ball he
will be a big hit.

GIULIANI ASSAILS ORGANIZER OF MILLION YOUTH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lashed out Wednesday at the
organizers of the proposed Million Youth March, calling its lead
organizer's words ``race-baiting and anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, this is a hate march,'' the mayor said
at a City Hall news conference. He noted that the strongest
language had come from the march's primary organizer, Khalid Abdul
Muhammad, although the mayor did not mention him by name.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a former aide to Louis Farrakhan, the minister of the
Nation of Islam, wants to hold the rally in Harlem on Sept. 5.
Organizers are billing it as a show of strength and unity by black
teen-agers from across the country, much like the Million Man March
that was held in Washington in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the city, citing traffic concerns, has denied Muhammad a
permit to hold the march on that date or on Harlem's Malcolm X
Boulevard. Muhammad has said the march would go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he threatened to shift its route to Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, as a ``direct confrontation with the Jews of that area.''
But Wednesday night he did not repeat that threat, saying instead,
``We do not choose to take our march to any other location in the
city. We would like to stay at home'' _ a reference to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad was dismissed by the Nation of Islam as its spokesman
in 1994 after a 1993 speech in which he referred to Jews as
``bloodsuckers'' and made other inflammatory remarks against Roman
Catholics, whites and homosexuals. He later founded the New Black
Muslim Movement and the New Black Panther Party, both based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Muhammad called New York a ``Jewish-controlled city''
and implied that Jews and other whites working for the mayor were
secretly responsible for the difficulties that march organizers
were having with the city. Giuliani excoriated that assertion
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric is extraordinary,'' the mayor said. ``The
attributions of the city's position to Jews in the administration
doing this is mind-boggling in this day and age.'' He called on New
Yorkers to stand up against the march's ``core of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Muhammad said his group had gone ``in good
faith'' to the city over the last year seeking permission for the
march. He said the group had shifted its focus for the march from
areas such as Central Park or Fifth Avenue to Harlem, in part
because it thought the city would not oppose a march in a black
area. ``The spirit of war that is in the air certainly did not
begin with us,'' Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor repeated several times that the group had a right to
demonstrate, and said that he would defer to the corporation
counsel and the Police Department as to when, where and whether the
march would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you are filled with hate rhetoric, you do have a
right to demonstrate and protest to a certain extent,'' he said.
``But you don't have a right to do it any place you want, anywhere
you want, anytime you want.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have offered two locations that they said could
accommodate large crowds _ Randalls Island and Van Cortlandt Park
in the Bronx _ as well as the alternate date of Sept. 19. Muhammad
has called the offer ``totally unacceptable.''

REVOLUTION HALT HOME SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution began the week hoping to
acquire Carlos Valderrama from Miami. But after that deal failed,
they placed their offense under the guidance of a lower-profile
Colombian, Oscar Alexander Pareja Gomez, and took a 3-0 victory
over San Jose Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pareja brought a semblance of control and creativity to the
midfield as the Revolution snapped a Major League Soccer-record
eight-game home losing streak and moved within a point of the final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Revolution, with 19
points in 23 matches, visit Columbus Saturday, and fourth-place
Miami visits last-place Tampa Bay Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can win the next nine games, 3-0, we can say it was a
smart thing that Carlos decided it was too cold here,'' Revolution
coach Thomas Rongen said. ``They are all professionals and they are
paid to do a job. That's what we talked about. Valderrama was the
last thing on our mind and had no influence on the way we played.
We just came out to get the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution seemed focused and purposeful at the
start. Pareja crossed to Joe-Max Moore, whose header was tipped off
the bar by diving goalkeeper David Kramer in the fifth minute. The
Revolution continued to pressure, and Moore dribbled through two
defenders to set up a corner that Ivan McKinley converted in the
13th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution soon reverted to their old habits and lost
control of midfield. But the Clash failed to capitalize, and Ian
Feuer made several spectacular stops, including tipping a 35-yard
Braeden Cloutier blast off the bar in the 26th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Moore converted a poor clearance against the run of play for a
2-0 lead in the 42d minute. And Raul Diaz Arce scored his 15th goal
of the season in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a win at home because we want to get into the
playoffs,'' said Pareja, a former Valderrama teammate. ``When I
have the ball at my feet, I can play football. Thomas wanted to use
me in that role because we had been working hard and not winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for a while, we lost communication and started doing what
we had been doing in previous games.''
</P>
<P>
   But if fortune had been against the Revolution since May 10,
when they took a 4-3 win over Tampa Bay at Foxboro Stadium, it was
with them in this match.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, starting for the first time since July 15, remained
secure as San Jose pressured for most of the first half and at the
start of the second. And Paul Keegan, who started on the left side
of midfield, provided an extra threat in the penalty area and also
bolstered the defense with an energetic performance. The Diaz
Arce-Moore striking combination also showed promise.
</P>
<P>
   But without Pareja's poise, the Revolution would have had little
to build on for the final two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find Oscar better,'' Rongen said. ``There was a
phase when we weren't maintaining possession, and we can't allow
that to happen against better teams because they will punish you
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareja is accustomed to winning _ he helped Deportivo Cali take
the 1996 Dimayor title in Colombia and has played 11 times for the
national team _ but he had been playing a minor role with the
Revolution. But with Moore moving to striker and Edwin Gorter to
sweeper, the midfield has opened. And Wednesday night Pareja seized
the opportunity.

 STINGY KNUCKLER WINS ONE FOR A's  
 (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Oakland Athletics crawled away after
Tuesday's doubleheader totally demoralized, stunned at blowing a
four-run lead in the ninth inning of the second game, some of their
players declaring the New York Yankees to be the game's best team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oakland knuckleballer Tom Candiotti salvaged the final
game of the four-game series, outdueling Hideki Irabu to beat the
Yankees, 3-1, on Wednesday night. Irabu allowed no hits in the
first four and one-third innings and only one hit in his first
seven and two-thirds innings, yet his record fell to 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (80-29), who won 7 of their 10 games on this West
Coast trip, were scheduled to fly home after Wednesday night's
game. Friday they will return to Yankee Stadium, where they will
play 35 of their final 53 games.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was on the verge of becoming only the 57th pitcher in
Yankees' history to pitch a one-hitter, but Rickey Henderson
slammed a solo home run in the eighth to clinch the Athletics'
victory. Candiotti allowed four hits and one walk, striking out
Darryl Strawberry, Tuesday's Yankee hero, on three soft
knuckleballs for the final out. With the victory secure, Candiotti
thrust his arms in the air as if he had just won the final game of
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had his best stuff since very early this season, when he
was leading the league in earned run average. His fastball
repeatedly reached 95 miles per hour on the radar gun _ Irabu would
pump it an extra two or three mph each time he threw with two
strikes. His splitter dove, his curveball bent sharply. He had
everything, and the Athletics were getting nothing early in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu retired the first 11 batters he faced, registering 3
strikeouts. In a season when the Yankees are re-inventing success,
it was natural for a mind to wander back to May 17, when David
Wells pitched a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   That potential drama disappeared when Irabu walked Ben Grieve
with two outs in the fourth inning. Irabu struck out Matt Stairs in
an eight-pitch at-bat, which the Yankees' pitcher finished with a
95 mph fastball that violated the personal space of Stairs'
knuckles. Bu-Bu, as Derek Jeter nicknamed Irabu, had gone through
four innings without allowing a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu bounced a fastball off Ed Sprague's side to open the
fifth and, with a temporary loss of control, threw four consecutive
fastballs high and out of the strike zone to walk Mike Blowers.
Miguel Tejada bunted the runners to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu tried getting ahead of Rafael Bournigal with a first-pitch
fastball, but Bournigal smacked it to right field for Oakland's
first base hit. Sprague scored and Blowers stopped at third. When
A.J. Hinch flied to deep right, Blowers tagged and crossed home for
a 2-1 Oakland lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez had been responsible for that Yankee run. Leading
off the fifth inning, Martinez waited for a knuckleball to float
over the plate, then powered it far beyond the right-field wall.
Martinez has 18 homers, and it was the Yankees' 23rd home run of
the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees threatened in only two other innings. Jeter doubled
with one out in the first, before Paul O'Neill flied out and Bernie
Williams fouled out. O'Neill singled leading off the seventh, and
Williams also singled, with O'Neill stopping at third.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out. Strawberry walked to load the bases before
Chad Curtis popped to shallow center and Jorge Posada flied to
medium-deep center, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ In need of a fresh pitcher, the Yankees called up the Queens
native MIKE JERZEMBECK and returned MIKE BUDDIE to Class AAA
Columbus. Jerzembeck, 26, was 3-7 with a 4.79 ERA for the Clippers.
He will pitch in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANDY PETTITTE, bothered by a strained muscle in his upper
back, will try to play catch Friday. If he feels all right, he will
start against the Kansas City Royals on Sunday. If not, then RAMIRO
MENDOZA will start in Pettitte's place and Yankees officials will
consider placing Pettitte on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees are monitoring ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, too, who has
lost more than 10 pounds since joining the team in early June. His
diminished weight hasn't affected his performance _ he pitched a
three-hitter Monday _ or his workouts. Torre suspects that
Hernandez weighs himself immediately after workouts, and is
confident the Cuban right-hander be fine.
</P>
<P>
   _ JASON GIAMBI, knocked out when DEREK JETER accidentally kneed
him in the head in the ninth inning of a game Tuesday, was not in
the lineup Wednesday night. The Oakland first baseman said he had
no recollection of the play. &QL;

2 CHARGED WITH SENDING CHILD PORN VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state deputy correction warden and a man who said
he was a teacher were arrested Wednesday on charges that they
transmitted pornographic images of children over the Internet in
separate cases, state and local prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy warden, Thomas Burke, 47, who works in the prison
ward at Brooklyn's Kings County Hospital, faces a four-count
indictment for possessing and transmitting two graphic photos of
children engaged in sex acts with adults, said state Attorney
General Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Anthony Wade, 30, faces 20 counts for
possessing and transmitting 10 such photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vile images allegedly transmitted by these defendants
graphically depict young children who are being sexually abused by
adults,'' Vacco said. He added that he had ``no tolerance for those
engaged in the trafficking of child pornography and those who
perpetuate the abuse and exploitation of young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Both suspects are from Staten Island. Prosecutors said Wade
claimed to be a teacher of disabled children at a local school, but
he did not specify which one and city school officials said his
name could not be found in their employee database.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been a correction officer for 25 years, said Thomas
Antenen, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services.
Burke was suspended without pay, pending the ruling on the charges
against him, Antenen said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects each face up to seven years in prison
on each count and could be required to register with the local
authorities as sex offenders under ``Megan's Law'' after their
release, prosecutors said. Bail was set at $250,000 for both men.

   A message left on Wade's answering machine was not returned
Wednesday, and a woman who answered the telephone at Burke's home
hung up when called for comment. Burke's lawyer was out of the
country and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants live less than 20 blocks from each other on
Staten Island but did not work in tandem, prosecutors said. Each
was brought to the attention of investigators after customers of
America Online, an Internet service provider, told the service that
they had received pornographic images from the defendants while
writing instant messages to other members in what are commonly
referred to as chat rooms, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal complaints filed against the men, Wade
transmitted the explicit images from February to May, both to
members of the online service and later to undercover agents who
logged into the chat rooms. Burke transmitted explicit images twice
in January, the complaint said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, Calif. _ Trying to escape the heat? The
rarefied air of the San Gabriel Mountains' high country can usually
be counted on to do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even at altitudes approaching 9,000 feet, recent
temperatures have surpassed 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the lure of coolness _ be it perceived or actual _ is
overwhelming, as evidenced by weekend foot traffic between Dawson
and Islip saddles in the Angeles National Forest. Dozens of
trekkers were drawn on a recent Saturday to Throop Peak, Mount
Hawkins and the other landmarks that identify the 7{-mile one-way
route that requires two vehicles. (Count on about 8{ miles if side
trips to both peaks are conquered.)
</P>
<P>
   If you can bear to part with your air conditioner, expect these
certainties from the expedition: fresh air, shade and downhill most
of the way... if you follow this descent enthusiast's
recommendations. Throw in some breeze _ always a possibility on a
course that passes a benchmark dubbed Windy Gap _ and it's a cool
trip after all.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest option is to start out where the Angeles Crest
Highway meets Dawson Saddle Trail at an elevation of 7,900 feet and
trek to 6,575-foot Islip Saddle. But, remember, !ilal!most!off! of
the way is downhill. First you must tackle the ridge rising to the
crest that traverses nearly three-quarters of the route. As you
cover Dawson Saddle Trail's 900-foot rise in 2 miles, keep
repeating, ``What goes up must come down.''
</P>
<P>
   From the highway, an old trail zigzags immediately from the
parking area while a newer, wider and safer version leaves the
roadway 150 yards to the east. The choice is yours; they couple
about a quarter-mile up.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Taylor, an off-highway vehicle technician with Angeles
National Forest, suggests getting an early start to avoid the
hottest part of the day. He hit the dirt at 6 a.m. to shoot some
videotape for his children in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send them clips whenever I can get out... just the limber
pines and the high country,'' Taylor said above the first extended
flat site on Dawson Saddle Trail.
</P>
<P>
   He warned of snow patches after slipping twice. It's not often
snowballs can be thrown in August outside of Los Angeles, but count
on it up here. Just ahead, visitors will also spot the first of
several appropriately named snow plants, a parasite that grows
alongside conifers. Its scarlet coloring contrasts the dull bark
and green needles of its hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Just when your gams start burning and you figure it's going to
be an uphill battle to the apex of 9,138-foot Throop Peak, the
trail begins to follow the contours of the peak's east shoulder.
The old route went straight up. Thankfully, the last trailblazers _
Boy Scouts in 1982 who logged 3,540 volunteer hours, according to
the guidebook ``101 Hikes in Southern California'' _ were more
sensible.
</P>
<P>
   At the 2-mile mark the course meets the crest (8,800 feet),
which is at once the Pacific Crest Trail, the Silver Moccasin Trail
and the northwestern boundary of the Sheep Mountain Wilderness.
Turn right and admire the white fir, Jeffrey pine and lodgepole
pine that line the path. Sharp eyes might spy the uncommon limber
pine.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a half-mile, a trail is scratched on the southwest
shoulder (8,925 feet) of Throop Peak. It is named after the founder
of Cal Tech, Amos G. Throop. The short scramble to the summit is a
precipitous but worthwhile side trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic, from go to whoa _ the entire adventure,''
said Catherine Bailie of Engadine, Australia, who, upon bagging the
peak, was greeted by butterflies near the hiker's register. ``I've
never been this high. I'm getting an altitude buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people dislike L.A. because they only see the city,
downtown and the intense heat and smog,'' Bailie said. ``I find it
incredible that you are an hour from the snow, the beach and the
desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Once rejoining the crest trail, the gentler detour to 8,850-foot
Mount Hawkins _ apparently named for a turn-of-the-century waitress
named Nellie Hawkins _ soon appears. As one hiker said, ``After
scaling Throop, you can't not do Hawkins.''
</P>
<P>
   With the outing's highlights behind you, continue the slow and
steady 4.2-mile decline northwest toward Islip Saddle. Hikers
quickly stumble upon a sign sandwiched between snow and pine cones
that flags Lily Spring (8,600 feet). A half-mile jog to the north
uncovers the only water in the excursion's first 5 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Talus, steep switchbacks, thick shade, the junction with the
trail to South Mount Hawkins (8,375 feet) and a sweeping view of
the San Gabriel Wilderness accent the 1.6 miles from the Lily
Spring sign to Windy Gap (7,575 feet), where pathways converge from
four directions.
</P>
<P>
   Take a lunch break to enjoy the refreshing blasts of air, then
tramp north less than a half-mile to the primitive but pristine
Little Jimmy Campground (7,475 feet); easily accessed Little Jimmy
Spring is situated midway. With picnic tables and rest rooms, the
camp is more luxurious than many along the Pacific Crest Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The next destination is a fire road in 1.2 miles (7,350 feet).
Between are long flat stretches, sugar pines, Windy Spring,
red-headed lizards and unwelcome highway sounds as the collision
with civilization becomes inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Cross the dirt road and the final mile _ though not the most
scenic portion of the trip _ exposes some interesting outcrops in
an abrupt ravine and the first glimpses of 8,214-foot Mount
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   As the pines disperse and chaparral takes over, a splendid
meadow and the source of Cortelyou Spring marks the end of the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If You're Going ...''
</P>
<P>
   The hike described here is a shuttle trip requiring two
vehicles. Drive both 40 miles northeast of La Canada Flintridge on
Angeles Crest Highway (2) to the Islip Saddle parking lot. (Look
for the first turnout to the left past the twin tunnels.)
</P>
<P>
   Park one car, load up everything and everybody into the second
rig and proceed up the highway 5{ miles to Dawson Saddle. Park and
begin your trek south to Throop Peak.
</P>
<P>
   National Forest parking passes are required; fees are $5 per day
or $30 per year. Camping is allowed; a free campfire permit is
necessary. Both documents can be obtained en route from the Angeles
National Forest's Clear Creek information center, located at the
junction of the Angeles Crest and Angeles Forest highways.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs on leashes are OK.
</P>
<P>
   The hike is found on the Crystal Lake 7.5-minute series
topographic map and Tom Harrison Cartography's ``Trail Map of the
Angeles High Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow five hours to complete the one-way route, longer if you
plan to scale Throop Peak and Mount Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the Arroyo Seco Ranger District,
(818) 790-1151.

   CASTAIC, Calif. _ His friends call bass angler Randy Best a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooo, vrooooooooooo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sound of him sucking up all the fish in the lake,''
said angling companion Darrel Dagdigian during a recent day on the
water at Castaic Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The vacuum will have to have all his accessories and talents in
high gear today as the BASS Masters Classic _ the world
championship of bass angling _ kicks off at High Rock Lake in
Lexington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a winner-take-all tournament,'' said Best, 38, of Norco,
who is Southern California's sole representative at freshwater
fishing's Super Bowl. ``If you don't win, you're nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually the winner takes $100,000 of the Classic's $350,000
purse. Even the last-place finisher in the field of 46 earns
$4,000. But Best's point is not lost: Only the champion is
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   And the tall and slender, sun-chafed angler with the brownish
mane and mustache streaked with gray _ ``That's kids,'' explained
the father of two _ predicts his name will be on the lips of the
120,000 fans officials expect to attend the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be first or worst,'' said Best as he pitched a
customized spider jig toward a bank along Castaic's northwest arm.
He got a feel for what the bite will be like at High Rock Lake
during the Classic's practice session July 5-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the area I have selected pretty much to myself _ or
at least the key spots _ and get a good start on them, I at least
have a chance of doing real well or possibly winning,'' said Best,
his piercing blue eyes never diverting from the line. ``But if it's
an area that I have to share with a few other competitors, my
chances will get lessened quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   His trip East is the farthest he has traveled to compete, and
the bite at the lake is notoriously picky. Anyone who gets a
five-bass limit even one day might take the title after the final
fish is weighed Saturday afternoon in front of the vocal crowd at
Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A reaction-bite specialist whose go-to lure is a spinnerbait,
Best plans to fish under docks and around brush using ``hardware''
to lure larger bass prone to pounce on fast-moving forage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will avoid the finesse fishing,'' said celebrated regional
bass-circuit angler Mike Folkestad, 57, of Yorba Linda, who Best
credits as his mentor. ``And I don't think the finesse fishing will
win that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a good chance of winning. He just has to get a
feel, get a bite going.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the bass only react to plastic worms and other
slower applications that compose the finesse baits _ which
typically get bit more frequently but by smaller fish _ Best could
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my biggest downfalls is changing up and scraping out
the worm fish,'' Best said. ``I hang on and try to break the bank
every time (with reaction baits).''
</P>
<P>
   Best sped his bass boat to another Castaic fishing hole, dipped
the trolling motor into the lake and tossed a new jig,
 &UR; !ital! &LR; zing &UR; !off! &LR; . It splashed down between questions. After
boating a half-dozen ``dinks,'' he finally hooked a bigger
largemouth bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicer fish, nicer fish,'' an onlooker said as Best hooked up
on a bucketmouth that would probably have gone over 2 pounds had he
managed to get it to the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long-distance release. I don't like touching the
fish,'' he joshed.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes and ribbing are all part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest key with fishing is it's meant to be fun,'' said
Best, who for 18 years has juggled his passion for bass circuits
with operating a poolside brick and tiling subcontracting business.
``If it's not fun, you don't belong in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he scaled back his routine of 10 or so tournaments a
year to four to spend more time with his family and ``keep it
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a career to me; it's a hobby,'' he said. ``Family
life is way more important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Best will be a decided underdog at the 28th annual Classic, as
will the other four anglers who qualified via the Western
Invitational circuit _ the inaugural series staged on the West
Coast by the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, or B.A.S.S., the
Montgomery, Ala., fishing and education group that runs the Classic
and its various circuits.
</P>
<P>
   However, his low profile among fishing-household names like
Jimmy Houston and Rick Clunn may work to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a tournament of this caliber, you have spectators
following you around (on the water), and there are television
boats, and that is a hindrance. It's unbelievable,'' Best said. ``I
probably won't have to worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Best's 11-year-old son, Brandon, is star struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son loves to fish. He's real excited because he gets to go
meet the true pros _ the Roland Martins and the Kevin VanDams. I
guess I'm just the tagalong for him,'' said Best, who will be
joined in North Carolina by Brandon, his daughter, Brittany, 8, and
his wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, after he named off about 10 names, I said, `They are
all going to be there, but just remember one thing: Your pop can
beat them.' I told him that and he said, `Oh, Dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bass angler Dagdigian also likes Best's chances, because he has
the attitude it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very confident,'' said Dagdigian, a 44-year-old La Mirada
dentist. ``I wouldn't say he was a braggart, but he doesn't have
any problem fishing behind anybody _ going right through that same
area someone else just went through and catching his fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Best would rather be known as a nice guy, not a good angler.
Still, the title of BASS Masters Classic Champion has a certain
ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooo, vrooooooooooo.

FISH STORIES BY WHICH TO LEARN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Overviews of a few recent angling titles, from
all-around trolling techniques to an education in fly-rodding for
trout to a guide for Eastern Sierra day-trippers:
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the ``Hunting &AMP; Fishing Library'' _ an
encyclopedia of how-to titles for the outdoorsman _ offers a
potpourri of tidbits for the beginning fly-angler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly Fishing for Trout in Streams'' (Cowles Creative
Publishing, $19.95) takes the uninitiated from the parts of a rod
(cigar grip vs. half-wells grip) to photography tips (natural light
_ the most attractive _ is best early or late in the day).
</P>
<P>
   The latter recommendation proves essential to this book, for its
most striking element is the artwork. One can earn an entire
education by studying the stellar step-by-step photographs and
graphics, and their captions. In the ``Subsurface Fly-Fishing
Techniques'' chapter, for example, a photo illustration solves the
mystery of the ``wet-fly swing.'' To cover as much area as possible
from one spot, cast across the current, mend the line to control
the speed of the fly and let the fly ``swing'' downstream until it
begins to rise to the surface. Lengthen each subsequent cast 1 to 3
feet until the water is worked thoroughly. Move to a new post and
repeat the process.
</P>
<P>
   The shots of trout foods, their life cycles and their imitations
are remarkably telling.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the text is often just as illustrative. Consider:
``Even though some live insects skitter across the surface of the
water, they rarely leave a visible wake. The wake left by a
dragging dry fly, by comparison, is very obvious to trout, and such
a presentation will rarely draw a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite understood why the 176-page book is included in
the publishing house's ``Freshwater Angler'' series instead of its
``Complete Fly Fisherman'' sequence. Perhaps the thinking is that
novices who wish to continue the recreation will want to graduate
to the purely fly-angling category. Whatever the marketing
strategy, ``Fly Fishing for Trout in Streams'' is certain to pique
interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though written with little imagination and far from polished in
presentation, ``Eastern Sierra Fishing Guide for Day Hikers''
(self-published by author John Barbier, $14.95) offers just enough
enticement and factual details to lure the angler away from Highway
395.
</P>
<P>
   The 120 pages have directions to dozens of backcountry lakes
that can be found by treading from 10 minutes to three hours beyond
the blacktop. Tackle and technique suggestions are woven into basic
descriptions of destinations, hiking access and fish life.
Primitive maps point to good fishing spots. There's room to keep an
extensive log.
</P>
<P>
   And it all fits into the glove box, offering just the solution
when the boats are all rented at Crowley and the cabins and camp
sites are all booked at Convict. Barbier, who hails from San
Marcos, makes a strong argument for getting away from the Eastern
Sierra's intensely popular roadside lakes: ``Only 5 percent of the
waters in the region are accessible by vehicle, but 95 percent of
the anglers concentrate on those waters. Of course, this means
uncrowded conditions and plenty of hungry trout for those willing
to walk a bit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you feel ready to advance your trolling methods to the next
level, check out ``The Troller's Handbook'' (Frank Amato
Publications, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   The 92 pages in small print by Livermore author and photographer
Ray Rychnovsky largely cater to those anglers who already know a
thing or two about enticing fish by using the movement of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Especially helpful are details on lead-core line and down
riggers. Both are under-utilized practices that allow baits to be
trolled deeper and more easily. But both can be complicated.
Rychnovsky unravels the formulas with straightforward descriptions
of gear and usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a light pull from a fish to release the clip so even
a small-hooked fish will pull the line from the down rigger,'' he
notes.
</P>
<P>
   In other chapters, however, such as ``Basic Trolling Depth,''
his explanations are less clear. And while billed as
``easy-to-use,'' the graphs employed to portray his points might
scare off landlubbers or anyone else who doesn't have the
background in engineering that Rychnovsky has.

   VENTURA, Calif. _ On a day when momentum shifted like currents,
contestants could sense that the team with the ``hottest sticks''
on the last stop would capture the third Big Bass Shoot Out between
two of the area's most visible angling clubs.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sea Biscuit anchored Sunday for the eighth and final
time off the south side of Santa Cruz Island, the nine members
representing the Los Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club made the most of it.
Down by five fish in a contest of total weight of calico bass
landed, the L.A. squad out-fished the San Fernando Valley Saltwater
Fisherman's team 22 bass to 11 to capture the coveted Shoot Out
trophy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest part of winning today was the relief of not losing
again,'' said LARRC's Joel Zide of Sherman Oaks, one of eight
designated baitfish anglers from both teams who held positions at
the stern. ``Our talent came through.''
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills' Rob DiGioia of the losing SFVSF squad said
momentum's fickle pendulum swung L.A.'s way to end the day: ``They
hung in there. Maybe we got a little complacent; I could feel it
slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fish counts and weight totals were tallied, the
scorecard read: Los Angeles _ 44 bass, 86{ pounds; San Fernando
Valley _ 38 bass, 75 pounds, 15 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   LARRC had lost the annual interclub event in 1996 by the
thinnest of margins _ less than the weight of a single bass _ and
last year in a blowout of proportions club anglers would rather
forget. Tarzana's Dan Felger, a charter member of the 48-year-old
L.A. coterie, summed up the triumph in simple terms: ``Wonderful,
fantastic, finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the delicate wording in the current club
newsletter that spurred the Los Angeles team, ``We hope to end our
unblemished record of no wins and two losses in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the inspirational words of LARRC's team captain
Michael Grossman of Tarzana, spoken in a hushed huddle after his
platoon made a spirited run to cut an early four-fish lead by the
Valley club to 16-15. ``You've got to keep fishing. We've made some
ground on them,'' Grossman said following the second stopover, on
the island's west end. ``Never quit. You've got to have your lines
in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was knotted at 20 bass when the party boat motored
away from the sixth fishing hole. On the lucky seventh whistle-stop
_ off the island's east end _ the Valley caught fire and registered
seven bass in a row before L.A. boated a pair to close the gap to
27-22 entering the final round.
</P>
<P>
   There was desperation in the faces of the L.A. squad, but its
anglers worked feverishly to overcome adversity. Half of its yield
came here as L.A. doubled the opposition's catch for the stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's outspoken team captain, Dimitri Peros of Westlake
Village, was at a surprising loss to explain his club's sudden
letdown. ``No comment,'' he said. ``I plead the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Robin Gist of Simi Valley was more candid: ``We got
spanked. It was their turn to win.''

 JAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ National League-style baseball invaded The
Ballpark in Arlington for eight innings Wednesday night. Then good
old American League muscle took over in the bottom of the ninth and
the Texas Rangers stole a thriller from the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, winning a gripping battle against reliever Randy
Myers, belted a game-tying home run leading off the inning, and
Mike Simms later followed with the winning single, allowing the
Rangers to rally for a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Walks worked by Will Clark and Todd Zeile in the ninth also
proved crucial for the Rangers, who earned their fourth consecutive
victory and opened up a 11/2-game lead over the Anaheim Angels in
the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got that grind attitude right now,'' Simms said. ``You
score one run, we're going to come back and score two. Everybody's
doing a great job, and everybody is doing their part. It's not just
one or two guys, it's all 25 guys. If we keep playing like this, I
like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza did his part, limiting the Blue
Jays to two runs on five hits through eight innings. But he left
with a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays took the lead in the ninth. Jose Cruz Jr. bounced
a single through the middle off reliever John Wetteland, pinch
runner Juan Samuel stole second and Samuel scored when Felipe
Crespo bounced a two-out single into right field.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza has a 3.62 earned-run average in four starts with the
Rangers since being acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates but is
still looking for his first American League victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have any luck getting that first victory, but it
was still a great game,'' Loaiza said. ``I'm throwing the ball
great and feeling great.''
</P>
<P>
   With Blue Jays starter Kelvim Escobar matching Loaiza, both
teams had to manufacture their runs using walks, stolen bases,
sacrifice flies and hitting behind the runner.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gonzalez flexed his muscles in the ninth and changed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, like most pitchers, tried to pitch Gonzalez with the
usual assortment of soft stuff. But Gonzalez worked the count full
and fouled off a couple of pitches before Myers tried to surprise
him with an inside fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they use to say with Hank Aaron,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Trying to slip a fastball by him is like
trying to slip the sun past a rooster.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wasn't surprised and smashed the fastball 415 feet into
the left-field seats to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to go deep,'' Gonzalez said. ``I was looking for
something close that I could hit out of the yard. The fastball was
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, struggling with his footing on the mound, then walked
Clark. Ivan Rodriguez lined out to center, but Zeile also worked a
walk, putting runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Myers then asked for the grounds crew to work the mound, while
Simms, pinch-hitting for Lee Stevens, waited patiently in the
on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Royce \RClayton\S, `Is this like icing the kicker?' ''
Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clay was really really damp and slippery,'' Myers said.
``I couldn't follow through or drive the way I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The mound work didn't help. Myers got ahead 1-2 in the count but
Simms then ripped a pitch into the left-field corner, scoring pinch
runner Luis Alicea with the game winning run.

TEXAS ON A ROLL, BUT ANGELS NOT ROLLING OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This will come as a shock to those of you who
have been in a state of euphoria since general manager Doug ``Deals
'R Us'' Melvin turned the baseball world on its ear Friday, but the
1998 American League West flag has yet to be raised over The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. I did a personal wall-to-wall search Wednesday night
and couldn't find hide nor hair of it, which also seemed to
surprise club president Tom Schieffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Schieffer said, rolling his eyes. ``They're actually
going to make us play the last 50 games?''
</P>
<P>
   At least I think that's what he said. His tongue was planted so
firmly in cheek, it was hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer also confirmed the worst. There has been no official
communique from the Anaheim Angels _ or the Mariners or A's for
that matter _ conceding the division championship to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   They will not, common sense and logic to the contrary, roll over
and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, in fact, are sticking to the Rangers like a grass
burr in the seat of their trousers. Irritating as it may be, they
show absolutely no signs of going away.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the American League faxed the Rangers indicating that,
due to Melvin's megadeals, they have already been seeded into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, those lines that snaked around The Ballpark on Tuesday
weren't fans in line for playoff tickets, but for Pugsly the Beanie
Baby (No, that's not Pudge Rodriguez's new nickname).
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say what I said a hundred games ago _ this thing is
going down to the last week of the season,'' manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh my. Best stock up on the Zantac now. Just remembering what
September was like in '96 is enough to raise the blood pressure 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we've got a chance to pull away but I don't think it's
going to happen, It just doesn't happen this late in the year.
We're going to play better and \Rthe Angels\S are going to play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be especially difficult for the Rangers to stretch their
West Division lead _ or maybe even to hold onto it _ over the next
2 1/2 weeks. Tonight kicks off a 17-game stretch against the Red
Sox (6), Indians (4) and Yankees (7).
</P>
<P>
   You may gulp at your leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the Angels play the White Sox (5), Tigers
(5) and Blue Jays (7).
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better at the end of the month and into September when
it's the Rangers taking on the White Sox, Tigers, Twins and Royals
while the Angels are dealing with the Yankees, Red Sox and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Survive the next 2 1/2 weeks and Melvin may have won himself an
executive-of-the-year award for his trade deadline deals...``if''
Oates and the Rangers can take it home from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you learn is never assume anything,'' Oates
said. ``I like our ballclub but we've still got to go out and play
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, if we went by what all the people said was going to
happen, we'd be in third place, about 10 to 12 games back. But I
don't pay any attention to that because I know we've got to come
out here and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing nods and pensive ``harumphs'' from the press box
pundits, who have proclaimed the Rangers division favorites because
of four key additions, don't faze Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put any stock in that stuff,'' said Oates, proving
once again that he's no dummy. ``I know we've got a better ballclub
than we did last week... better defense, better starting pitching.
We're deeper and we've got a little more consistent offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still have to play these last 50 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, in the meantime, is working the phones again, trying to
find a left-hander for the bullpen. Lefties are hitting .296
against Eric Gunderson, and Scott Bailes is on the disabled list
with bursitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some left-handed hitters coming up we need to get
out,'' Oates said, ``and Doug's working on it. But right now, if a
guy can even wipe his nose left-handed, there's no way he can get
through waivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement level, Oates conceded, has been cranked up a few
notches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, when you're in the hunt, is when it gets
exciting,'' he said. ``This is what you started out back in the
middle of February working for. You don't want to be 25 games out
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five games up would be nice but, like those concession
letters, that's just wishful thinking.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOOD NEWS VS. BAD VIBES FROM CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 9.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consider some of the ways the Internet improves our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one: The other day, my son Sam walked into a library
building at the University of Heidelberg, sat down at a German
computer keyboard, accessed a Yale University e-mail account that
in Connecticut, and exchanged dozens of messages with his college
friends, who have scattered for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although students are able to romp in cyberspace for free from
Heidelberg, the librarians there insist that every visitor check
his or her gear at the door and pay what amounts to a $4 deposit to
make sure it's picked up on departure. It's a question of security.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: A pair of huge, once-valued stereo amplifiers
have sat in my attic for years. Recently, within hours of posting
those goods on a World Wide Web hi-fi flea market site, I found a
buyer in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the express company collects the cash on delivering the
package, selling the vintage amps to an utter stranger posed little
risk to me. But what if that shipment held bricks instead of the
advertised goods? Again, it's a matter of trust.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Internet can offer users more convenient and
flexible ways of exchanging data or buying and selling goods than
traditional forms of trade or communication. But broadly felt
distrust hampers electronic commerce from reaching its full
potential.
</P>
<P>
   As matters stand, it's a snap to upload a ``contract'' saying,
for instance, that you've agreed to give me free phone service for
the next six months. So, absent the safety provided by what
insiders call trusted systems, it's understandable that not many of
us feel comfortable using e-mail to issue invoices, pay bills or
write binding contracts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, each time a bug is found in Internet software, the
confidence needed to create a true mass market is shaken anew.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last month when researchers at Finland's Oulu
University came across some fresh digital mischief. It permits
e-mail that arrives along with an attached file _ in some
situations _ to stall a computer, kill data, or unleash a virus.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Microsoft nor Netscape had received customer
complaints about the vulnerability of their e-mail ``clients,''
both firms promptly moved to patch their exposed software. As is
usually the case, the supposed dangers, but not the subsequent
fixes, made news.
</P>
<P>
   Foolproof Internet security requires users to implement such
related concepts as access control, audit trails, authenticated
identities, guaranteed privacy, and validity checks that ensure
data hasn't been corrupted during either transmission or storage.
Experts also see a need to bar people from disavowing transactions
_ so the assertion that ``I never placed that order'' flies only if
it's accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some good news: All these needs are now being tested in
major computer labs. Some of them can already be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, bad vibes continue to float through cyberspace.
And, unless human character changes in our digital future, for many
people, these concerns are likely to persist.

   &UR; Innovative therapies and better health habits have helped to
substantialy reduce new cancer cases and deaths. &LR;   &UR; Now doctors are

 &HT;    COLUMN: For return of `Halloween,' let's celebrate slasher
spirit
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shane never came back. But Jamie Lee Curtis has.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after her breakthrough role in ``Halloween,'' she's
returned to her scream-queen roots in ``Halloween H2O.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Halloween'' engendered a whole new genre, known
variously as slasher movies or splatter flicks. Typically, to make
the ``Halloween'' connection clear, they were given commemoratively
themed titles: ``My Bloody Valentine,'' ``Prom Night,'' etc. They
also featured a new kind of nasty: a boogeyman (or woman) who, in
the immortal words of Michael Myers' doctor (Donald Pleasence) in
``Halloween,'' ``has no reason, no conscience, no understanding ...
he just kills.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is also almost always unkillable. That's called
sequel-think.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, the cream of the slasher crop, including two movies
that, technically, owe nothing to ``Halloween'' but should be on
the list of anyone in the mood for mindless gore:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Halloween'' (1978):
</P>
<P>
   The story: A little-boy-psycho grows up to be a big-boy-psycho
and, after breaking out of a mental hospital, comes home to, um,
celebrate Halloween with his sister (Curtis) and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: It started the whole slice-and-dice film cycle of
the late 1970s and early '80s. By 1984, ``Halloween,'' which was
made for $320,000, had grossed more than $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: He wears a Halloween mask and can't seem to
kill girls who don't date much.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Sexually active teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Director John Carpenter, a
smart ol' boy from Kentucky, knew exactly what he had done in
making ``Halloween.'' He told The New Yorker (pre-Tina Brown!) that
his movie was ``purely an exercise in style. The plot is barely
existent. ... It's a haunted-house movie.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984):
</P>
<P>
   The story: Wes Craven's movie is a bad dream come true.
Literally. And over and over. Four teenagers all suffer from the
same nightmare in which they're chased by a demented pervert named
Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund).
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Its success inspired five sequels of varying
quality (No. 2 is the worst, 4 is the best). Altogether, Freddy and
his dreamers made more money for their studio, New Line, than the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: A rakish combo of a striped sweater borrowed
from a Dead End Kid, a slouch hat that Jimmy Durante might've worn,
and razor-blade fingernails. He has trouble killing ''good'' girls,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Teenagers who live on Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Craven dreamed up the movie
while sitting at a restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. He based the
premise on some articles in the Los Angeles newspaper about people
who had inexplicably died in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' (1974):
</P>
<P>
   The story: Unlucky teenagers come across a very strange family
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Predating ``Halloween,'' Tobe Hooper's lurid,
low-budget movie became well-known on the cult and midnight
circuits because of its unabashed nastiness (say, a lamp made of
human arms).
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: Leatherface, the main boogeyman, wears a mask
made of human flesh and wields (rather ineptly, it must be said)
the titular chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Teenagers who take a wrong turn _ especially
females in hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: The voice of the ominous
narrator at the beginning belongs to an unbilled John Larroquette.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Dawn of the Dead'' (1979):
</P>
<P>
   The story: George Romero's flesh-eating zombies invade a
shopping mall. Sort of the ultimate Atlanta movie. (When one
character wonders why they've come to the mall, another explains,
``They don't know why ... they just remember ... remember they
wanna be here.'')
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: This long-awaited sequel to Romero's ``Night of
the Living Dead'' is less known but made more money. And it's a lot
funnier (zombies ride escalators while Muzak plays).
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: The usual Romero zombie-mix in polyester or
leather.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Anything still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Explaining the look of the
film, Romero said, ``I wanted the mall to look like a mall. ... I
wanted bright light in what is, except for the zombies, a safe,
comfortable environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the ``Friday the 13th'' series?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, these are supposed to be recommendations.

 &HT;    Kindergartners test toys for Disney
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Here's the toy that should top your Christmas
shopping list:
</P>
<P>
   Stop My Hiccups Dil.
</P>
<P>
   Who says so?
</P>
<P>
   The kids at the KinderCare center on Jog Road who are testing 45
toys _ some of them not on the market yet _ for Disney's FamilyFun
magazine's annual Toy of the Year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cries and sucks his binky,'' explains Rachel Edelson, 7,
who neglected to mention that Dil belches authoritatively as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says `I love you,' '' added 8-year-old Ashley Tapper, and
says ``Mama'' and ``Goodbye,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of dolls do that. But this doll is modeled on a Rugrats
character who isn't even in the hugely successful Nickelodeon
cartoon show yet.
</P>
<P>
   He's Dillon, Tommy's little brother, who will debut in a Rugrats
Thanksgiving movie. But the kids know that already. Dil, made by
Mattel, will cost $40 when he's released later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 3- to 4-year-olds and 5- to 7-year-olds are part of 1,000
children in eight child care centers across the country who are
trying out the toys for several weeks. Next week, they choose their
favorites in various categories.
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh year, FamilyFun will publish the winners in 23
age groups and categories in its November issue, out in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need some advance information on what to buy. Who
better to ask than kids?'' said Executive Editor John Adolph.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has a good track record, choosing Tickle Me Elmo as
a top choice in 1996 and Sleep 'N Snore Ernie last year. Could the
T.O.Y. awards be creating a market?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with our 1.2 million circulation, we wouldn't generate
that kind of groundswell (as Elmo caused),'' Adolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular is the Godzilla Rampage game in which children
fashion Play-Doh figures. ``The fun part is when you get to squish
the people's cars and trucks (with Godzilla),'' said Lauren
Brackman, 6.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for filling out forms and interviewing the children
on their preferences, the Lake Worth KinderCare keeps the toys.
</P>
<P>
   What to leave on the shelf? Walk 'N Talk Big Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked him the first day _ his shoes and clothes come off
_ but ever since he's been standing over there against the wall,''
said child care worker Jennifer Miller.

 &HT;    Woodworking information more readily available
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A query on the Internet brings to mind the days not so long ago
when information on fine woodworking was nearly impossible to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relatively new and inexperienced to woodworking,'' it
asks. ``Can anyone recommend a magazine which will be instructive
and understandable?''
</P>
<P>
   I believe the 1980s marked the woodworking boom. Before then you
got your information out of Popular Mechanics and a rather dismal,
hard-to-find magazine whose name escapes me. I'm not sure it's
still around.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a visit to the magazine section of a major bookstore will
display at least half a dozen excellent periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   I've always believed that Fine Woodworking magazine and its
publisher, the Taunton Press, was largely responsible for the boom.
In addition to the magazine, the firm started publishing
well-written, beautifully illustrated books on design and
technique.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine and books were a revelation to most of us.
Virtually the only books available before the revolution were
wretched technical school textbooks on how to make commercial
cabinets as cheaply as possible and weekend-hobbyist books of
projects that weren't worth the fir plywood of which they were
supposed to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Woodworking ruled the roost for several years. Its only
competition for a while was a subscription-only, no-advertising
publication called Woodsmith. Woodsmith was, and I assume still is,
a no-nonsense but never pedestrian magazine presenting projects
with plans and detailed articles on how to execute them. While the
design of the projects was rarely remarkable, it was seldom bad,
either.
</P>
<P>
   I dropped my subscription to the magazine, and to a companion
publication called Shop Notes, when I began running out of space.
From a look at WoodSmith's Web site --
www.augusthome.com/woodsmth.htm -- it may have changed hands, but
when I see it on newsstands it looks exactly as it did several
years ago. It's still punched out for a three-ring binder, and it
still carries no ads.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Woodworking has not fared so well. It has shrunk somewhat
from its glory days, and run through enough editors to staff
several other magazines -- particularly its chief competitor,
American Woodworker. I've never quite understood why so many
woodworkers get upset with Fine Woodworking. Many traditionalists,
of course, reel with disgust at the avant garde designs it often
presents. A truly lovely offshoot concerning itself entirely with
furniture design died after a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I still find it the most satisfying of all the
magazines, even if it does cost a rather staggering $7 at the
newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   American Woodworker has grown from just another wannabe to an
outstanding publication, somehow seeming to satisfy many of the
amateurs that Fine Woodworking does not, and at half the newsstand
price. It has retreaded several of Fine Woodworking's original
stars, especially one-time editor John Kelsey and British
woodworker-teacher-writer Ian Kirby -- who set up shop briefly in
Atlanta about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the two magazines share a lot of writers, like the
ebullient Hungarian master craftsman Frank Klausz.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that American Woodworker does well that Fine
Woodworking rarely ever attempted is reviewing tools. It does this
frankly and honestly, always trying to get as broad an overview of
a particular kind of tool as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Better Homes and Gardens Wood has gone from a jumped-up Popular
Mechanics to a very good middle-of-the-road magazine. Woodshop News
is an industry newspaper geared largely to small-shop professionals
and, as such, is generally of interest to the proficient amateur.

EARLY DETECTION KEEPING CANCER RATES IN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spotting cancer before it spreads is the next best thing to
preventing it, and doctors are getting better at that sort of early
detection.
</P>
<P>
   In June the US Food and Drug Administration approved the
ImageChecker, a computerized system that rechecks a radiologist's
review of mammograms and possibly catches signs of breast tumors
that the eye missed. High-tech digital mammograms and magnetic
resonance imaging are further refining detection, giving doctors
pictures that let them pick out cancers that otherwise would remain
hidden, and weeding out false positive readings.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer deaths fell by 1.7 percent a year from 1990 to
1995, ``and if we can find cancers that we're missing now, we
potentially can lower that another 25 percent,'' says Dr. Daniel B.
Kopans, who runs the breast imaging program at Massachusetts
General Hospital. But for that to happen, he adds, ``women should
definitely come in once a year for screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Early detection also is having a growing impact on colon cancer.
Tests for blood in the stool can signal the presence of polyps or
tumors, while optical rectal scopes can pinpoint suspicious-looking
cells. And researchers are using CAT scans to take multiple images
of the colon, creating a ``virtual colonoscopy'' that avoids the
need to insert an instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Additional screening tests are available for cancer of the
pelvis, oral cavity, prostate, skin, thyroid, testicles, and other
organs. Most should be done with increasing frequency as a patient
ages, or if the patient has a family history of that cancer. Some
tests, like the one for skin cancer, involve a physical examination
that patients can do themselves; others, such as for cervical
cancer, involve procedures that require medical personnel and a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Screening is sure to become even easier and more precise as it
capitalizes on recent advances in the laboratory. ``Most tests now
are based on anatomy and subtle differences between normal and
aberrant, like looking for blood in the stool,'' says Dr. Barnett
S. Kramer, deputy director for prevention at the National Cancer
Institute. ``But they're crude because you have to wait for the
polyps or cancers to bleed. Since the tumors are so close to the
surface of the gut, perhaps the next generation of early detection
is to look for the DNA signatures of cells and look for molecular
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to fish out molecular needles in the haystack.''

 &HT;    A downtown that straddles two states finds unity and prosperity
in division
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga.-Copperhill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new line in town.
</P>
<P>
   You see it slice through the Hometown Foods IGA and its parking
lot, then continue diagonally across the street before scaling the
yellow brick building that houses the Copper Emporium furniture
store.
</P>
<P>
   The long blue line isn't just the talk of the town; it's the
talk of two states.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Copper Basin, known now for tourism and white-water
rafting instead of its once-flourishing copper industry, the North
Georgia town of McCaysville (population 1,062) shares a downtown
with Copperhill, Tenn. (501). And they share the blue line, rich in
irony: Closely approximating the border separating the two states,
it was painted to unify the two municipalities and to draw the
attention of a new wave of visitors brought in on an excursion
train from nearby Blue Ridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Goss, who with his wife, Cricket, owns the IGA, calls the
line ``a point-of-interest line, not a dividing line. It reminds us
that we have common problems and concerns and that we have to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Myers tells it, the idea for the line surfaced a few
months ago when a ``spontaneous group'' of about a dozen area
residents got together at a coffee shop and began talking about
``the common misconception that the Toccoa River is the border''
between Georgia and Tennessee. Actually, the state line slices
across the river, which is called the Toccoa in Georgia and the
Ocoee in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would a line clear up the confusion about the border,
the group believed, but it also would be ``an oddity that people
could relate to, something to have fun with,'' recalls Myers, a
computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   So, in early June and mostly at night to avoid traffic, he and
others, including artists Rebecca Williams and Marilou Knight,
began painting the block-long line, using the same kind of paint
that marks handicap parking spaces. Their efforts were temporarily
foiled when the parking lot was resurfaced, but the group recently
began restriping the lot, tackling the job on a sultry Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Goss is a longtime line man, having painted one in the store lot
several years ago, amid the influx of visitors for Olympic events
on the Ocoee. And he's also a veteran of the two-state business
world, noting with a laugh that ``we have the privilege of paying
taxes in both states.''
</P>
<P>
   How's the line working? It's fun, doing its job of getting
attention and bringing in visitors, say business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of visitors come in and want to know where the line
is,'' reports Kay Brown, co-owner with daughter Becky Morgan, of
the Colonial House, which sells antiques, jewelry and collectibles.
``They love to straddle the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jack, adds that many people ``come in and say, `We
walked all the way from Tennessee to get to your place.'''
</P>
<P>
   The line was a hit one recent Saturday when the Blue Ridge
Scenic Railway train roared in and unloaded passengers for an
hourlong visit before making the 13-mile trip back to Blue Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Several people took turns straddling the line while friends and
family recorded the event on film. And Lillian Thomason of Canton,
Ga., played with her young granddaughter, Maria Allison, holding
hands across the blue stripe. ``We're a long way apart,'' Thomason
joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite an experience, being in two states at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something profoundly moving about this
seemingly simple act. In this vast country, where the sheer
magnitude of place can diminish a mere human, the ability to touch
two states at once somehow makes a person feel more in scale, more
a part of the great big space.
</P>
<P>
   The new blue line, which so keenly looks to the future, also
recalls the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody around here tells the story of how the
official state border -- the one that the blue line closely traces
-- is bogus because surveyors back in the 1800s spent too much time
sampling from a moonshine still they had wandered upon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's the reason for the mistaken survey or just a good
story, Georgia rightly has contended that its boundary with
Tennessee should lie farther north -- at the 35th parallel, as
specified in the laws of both states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correcting the boundary would shift a mile-wide strip of south
Chattanooga and most of Copperhill to Georgia,'' says Edwin
Jackson, co-author with Marion Hemperley of ``Georgia's Boundaries:
The Shaping of a State,'' published in 1993 by the University of
Georgia's Carl Vinson Institute of Government.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not likely to happen, says Jackson, a faculty member at
the institute. ``Although suit could be filed in the U.S. Supreme
Court, rulings of that court in similar situations suggest that a
boundary long recognized and accepted will stand, even if later
found to have been drawn in error.''
</P>
<P>
   The state line has worked in strange ways. Consider Marion
``Cap'' Hamby, a barrel-chested, big-voiced copper plant foreman
who rose to political power in the 1920s and lived in a house on
the border. His daughter-in-law, Luneta Hamby, has a newspaper
clipping from the Feb. 11, 1944, Copper City Advance, which
reports:
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion Hamby has served, at different times, as the mayor of
McCaysville and the mayor of Copperhill without moving his
residence. He was mentioned in `Ripley's Believe It or Not' several
years ago as the only man who had served as mayor in two cities, in
two different states, while living in the same house.'' (The
article notes that the law at that time allowed residents on the
line ``to choose the state of their choice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Strolling around town on a recent steamy morning, Luneta Hamby,
history lover and onetime tour guide, said that shopping and living
and dining and attending school in two states always has been part
of everyday life for area residents, and that now the blue line
brings that duality alive for tourists. ``I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   And a big change. The 54-year-old article notes, ``For all
practical purposes the line is disregarded and the north side of
the river is called Copperhill and south of the river is known as
McCaysville. Or more simply, the Georgia side and the Tennessee
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Comes now the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   It's already highly visible, and organizers want to make it even
more notable; plans call for extending the line for several blocks
-- over the tops of five buildings. ``It'll be fun for small
airplanes,'' says Bob Myers. ``We hope to become a landmark they
could use for points of reference. And the line could be part of a
sightseeing trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus it seems that, for this blue line, the sky's the limit.

 UNDATED: ... of the risk.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diet and obesity account for another 30 or so percent of cancer
deaths. While the onslaught of studies on diet is confusing, the
1996 Harvard Report on Cancer Prevention offers some clearcut
advice: Eat less animal fat. Reduce consumption of red meat to once
a week or less. Eat more fruits and vegetables, a minimum of five
servings a day. Don't blacken or char meat, fish, or chicken. And
don't consume too much alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   With alcohol, knowing just how much is too much is difficult, as
it is with many health recommendations. The Harvard report, which
distilled the latest findings in the field, provides a bit more
guidance, at least for women. Two drinks per day, it says, probably
increases the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent, and women with a
family history of the disease should avoid alcohol entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, says Dr. David Hunter, director of the Harvard Center
for Cancer Prevention, that warning must be tempered by knowledge
that ``while alcohol almost certainly increases the risk of breast
cancer, it decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercise carries fewer caveats, since obesity is a major risk
factor for heart disease and diabetes, as well as for cancers of
the cervix, uterus, ovary, endometrium, and gallbladder in women,
and of the colon and prostate in men. Women who are more than 35
percent above ideal body weight have a 55 percent higher chance of
developing those cancers, while overweight men stand a 40 percent
greater risk of obesity-sensitive cancers. And there's new evidence
that preventing weight gain also lowers the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other critical contributors to cancer, the Harvard report says,
are dangerous workplaces, a family history of cancer, viruses and
other infectious agents, pollution, and too much exposure to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the most exciting development has been
the prospect of developing cancer-preventing drugs. Last spring
came the news that tamoxifen, now a standard treatment for older
victims of breast cancer, could save 20,000 more lives a year
worldwide. Taken just after surgery for five years, it halved the
recurrence rate over 10 years, along with the risk of developing a
new cancer in the other breast. But two comparable studies from
Europe last month produced inconclusive results, leading many
scientists to conclude that it is too early to know whether the
drug really does prevent breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention advocates insist that much more research must be done
on tamoxifen and other potential ways to head off the disease. NCI
officials counter that, since 1993, spending on prevention and
control programs has more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, meanwhile, says it's critical that ``we not get into a
prevention-or-cure debate if we can help it. We need to concentrate
on prevention because there are some proven methods there and a lot
more we can do. But we have to recognize that if someone has a
diagnosis of cancer, it's too late for prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wide array of treatments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What cancer patients often want as much as anything is help in
deciding which conventional treatments might work for them and,
even harder, which unconventional therapies they should try.
</P>
<P>
   The list of touted therapies is overwhelming, from Chinese herbs
to shark's cartilage, tai chi to homeopathy, biofeedback and
acupuncture. And oncologists generally aren't much help sifting
through the possibilities to see which make sense and how they
might interact with mainstream medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every patient I have inquires about alternative
therapies,'' says Dr. Thomas J. Lynch Jr., who runs the thoracic
oncology unit at Mass. General. ``I try to tell them that there's
far more we don't know than we do. If the therapy lets them gain
some sense of control, it can have a positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all most cancer doctors can offer. They say they want to
support anything that makes a patient feel better, but don't have
enough scientific evidence to endorse a particular approach. For
many medical doctors, it's also a matter of overcoming a historic
distrust of alternative therapists, one that sees them peddling an
unproven art, even as many alternative healers see MDs as promoting
toxic, ineffective, and expensive conventional treatments.
</P>
<P>
   That gap is beginning to be bridged, however, largely in
response to an insistence by patients that their doctors and other
healers start working together.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of detente involves vocabulary. Rather than being
described as ``alternative'' or ``unconventional,'' nontraditional
techniques are being called ``complementary,'' which puts the
emphasis on collaboration rather than differentiation. And rather
than operating from offices that are isolated physically and
politically from the mainstream, they are being invited in to
hospitals and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the growing good will was a first-ever meeting
last month outside Washington, where hundreds of high-level
conventional and complementary therapists gathered to discuss the
roles that herbalism, meditation, and other nonmainstream therapies
can play in treating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not so much, will conventional medicine pay
attention to specific therapies? The real question is, are we going
to develop an integrated way of working with patients who have
cancer?'' says Dr. James S. Gordon, who organized the conference
and runs the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington. ``The
public demands that we all work together. Ordinary decency demands
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Wittes, director of cancer treatment and diagnosis at
the NCI, also struck a conciliatory note at the conference, but he
didn't shy away from the hard work that lies ahead before
mainstream doctors will endorse nontraditional treatments: ``If I
have to give up much of what I know about chemistry and physics,
then the evidence that it does work will have to be
incontrovertible.''

 &HT;    Fireproof gel overnight hero
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM HARBOR, Fla. _ John Bartlett coated his hand with the milky
lotion he was trying to sell and turned a 3,000-degree,
propane-torch flame on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not a knuckle hair was singed.
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of stunt the Palm Beach County firefighter has
performed hundreds of times across the nation in the past four
years to promote his invention, Barricade Fire Blocking Gel, a
slimy material that's mixed with water and sprayed on buildings and
underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the product remained relatively unknown outside firefighting
circles until Bartlett and business partner Bruce Hill, also a Palm
Beach County firefighter, used it on 20 homes in Flagler County
during the recent wildfires there. They coated the homes and
retreated. When the fires passed and they returned, the homes were
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Barricade become an overnight hero.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bartlett and his Jupiter-based Fire Protection Inc.
have been featured on CBS and ABC news and written up in newspapers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has had more sales and inquiries than ever. The
men are talking to more distributors and sending out videos and
information packets instead of spending all their time at trade
shows, although they still give their share of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday they demonstrated the fireproof gel to several dozen
Tampa-area firefighters on a fire road in Brooker Creek Preserve in
Pinellas County.
</P>
<P>
   They torched plywood partially coated with with the gel, leaving
one side charred black and the other unscathed. They set palmetto
scrub on fire in an area demarcated by Barricade. The fire stopped
dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is truly impressive,'' said Phil Travis, an
environmental specialist with the Pinellas County Department of
Environmental Management. ``You can steer fire with it. You can run
along side of fire and divert it. You can run it around things. You
can steer it into a lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Barricade is currently being bought by Martin, Flagler and
Putnam counties, and fire departments in California and Oregon,
Hill said. The U.S. Army has also used it to protect buildings when
burning down old barracks.
</P>
<P>
   But what the men really want to do is build up the capability to
sell Barricade on a mass scale in hardware stores and perhaps on
QVC, the home-shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   They are a little worried that there's nothing keeping
competitors from making their own slime. While they have patents
pending, a well-financed chemical company could make a similar
product by modifying enough molecules to make it distinct. The
product could be cheaper than Barricade and backed by a national
marketing strategy that Bartlett and Hill could not match.
</P>
<P>
   But Bartlett, 44, of Jupiter and Hill, 41, of Palm Beach
Gardens, say they're not overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two firefighters. We know what we're doing. We've got
the diaper-story connection. We've had great successes in (Flagler
County),'' Hill said. ``We are the product. It's not the gel.''
</P>
<P>
   The creamy gel retards fire by trapping water up to 700 times
its own weight. Bartlett happened on the idea in 1993, after
putting out a trash fire in Jupiter and noticing that disposable
baby diapers hadn't burned.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Protection has spent about $500,000 developing Barricade.
Most of the money has come from Bartlett and his father and has
been used to attend fire shows to demonstrate Barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million layers of polymer particles, and each layer
protects the layer underneath,'' Bartlett said. ``It allows us to
'stick' the water where we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Barricade must be mixed with water in order to work. As it is
watered down, Barricade becomes more viscous. After use, it can be
hosed off with water. It's biodegradable and environmentally safe,
according to Bartlett, because it's similar to the material in baby
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Once sprayed on, Barricade will last six hours or more before it
begins to evaporate, allowing the user to apply the goo and clear
out well before a fire is dangerously close. Class A foam, by
comparison, lasts about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing whatever we can so people can see we're not a
bunch of charlatans,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fire Protection created a gallon-sized dispenser that
hooks up to an ordinary garden hose. It resembles a plastic
anti-freeze jug with a hose and nozzle, and sells for $189 -- $35
of which is for one gallon of the goo and the rest for the
container. It takes about three gallons to coat an average-sized
residential home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building our infrastructure, getting the marketing
people and getting warehouse space,'' Hill said. ``But when this
thing starts hitting the market, you're going to get a Monsanto and
other competitors out there.''

 &HT;    Bad news for school dropouts means better news for parents
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ To see a play at the Kravis Center or to
take soil samples from the Lake Worth Lagoon, Florida, high school
students need a permission slip signed by mom, dad or a legal
stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   But to drop out of school? No signature required.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this fall, a Florida student can't drop out of school _
even at age 16 _ until a parent or guardian signs off on the
decision. The student also must sign a statement saying he knows
he'll probably earn less and have a greater chance of being
unemployed as a high school dropout.
</P>
<P>
   Both requirements are part of a law passed by the Florida
Legislature this spring designed to make students understand the
consequences of leaving school early _ and maybe help them change
their minds. No one can force them to comply, but students who
aren't officially withdrawn from school risk being picked up as
truants or even losing driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give everybody a chance to take a deep breath and
think this through,'' said David Mosrie, a state education
official.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be that easy.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens who drop out don't tell school officials; they simply
disappear, often with hundreds of dollars worth of textbooks and
uniforms or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just stop showing up,'' said David Cantley, principal at
Lake Worth High School.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Hill High School Principal Carlos Rosello said the school
tries to contact parents of missing kids _ through letters and
phone calls _ often with no success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a chance to even talk to a kid or a parent, I could
easily cut down on dropouts,'' he said. ``I don't know how I'm
going to get anyone to sign anything.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 school year, 2,737 of 23,827 students in
grades 10 through 12 dropped out of the county's schools. The year
before, 1,639 of 22,412 students in those grades were dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials were officially notified of the
changed law this week. Forms need to be created and the procedure
will have to be written into school board policy, meaning it will
take time before schools can start seeking signatures.
</P>
<P>
   There is no penalty for parents or students who don't comply.
``Since we're not an armed camp, they can walk out and not come
back,'' concedes Ron Armstrong, director of pupil personnel
services for the school district.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said police may pick up students who don't withdraw
properly for being truant, which means a trip to the West Palm
Beach Truancy Center and a call home to be picked up. These
unofficial dropouts also risk losing driving privileges because the
district is required to report habitual truants to motor vehicle
officials, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   State and district officials said they hope to make this an
opportunity to counsel more students to stay in school _ or to
pursue alternative schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out the pain dropouts can feel in their wallets may
help. Students will be told that dropouts typically earn one-third
less over a lifetime compared with high school graduates, that they
are twice as likely to be unemployed and their chances of going to
jail are three to nine times greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids drop out because they want the jobs (immediately),
whether it's for a car or clothes,'' said Associate Superintendent
Cynthia Pino. ``What it's an attempt to do is tell them it's not a
good long-term decision.''

 &HT;    You can't fight the IRS
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newspaper headline said President Clinton had signed a bill
to make the Internal Revenue Service simpler and fairer. I'm afraid
it comes too late for me, and the lady who does most of the
arithmetic at our house.
</P>
<P>
   Since she remains in the work force, supplementing my Social
Security check in order to keep me up in the style to which I have
become accustomed, we still have to ante up. Being self-employed,
she has no payroll deductions. She has to write a check.
</P>
<P>
   Last April 15 we couldn't lay hands on a K-1 form having to do
with a disastrous investment in a well-known Atlanta hotel, an
investment made when I was gainfully employed and had a few dollars
available for sucker schemes.
</P>
<P>
   We had to ask the IRS for an extension. When you apply for an
extension, you have to send in approximately what you owe. Sammy
Freeman, our friendly CPA, told us we'd have to cough up $7,000. We
sent the IRS a check for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later we got a notice from the IRS informing us we
owed $6,479, including interest and penalties. About the same time,
while attempting to balance our checkbook, she discovered we had an
extra $6,300 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   After half a morning of punching telephone buttons and listening
to elevator music, she finally got through to a real person. The
real person said in depositing our $7,000 check, an IRS clerk had
left off a zero. Instead of $7,000, only $700 got punched in.
``Happens all the time with the IRS,'' said the bank person.
</P>
<P>
   When the bank caught the error, it followed the rules. It
notified the IRS of its error and sent $6,300 to the Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the wonders of electronic banking we get canceled
checks in our monthly statements only if we request them. She asked
the bank for a photostatic copy of our canceled $7,000 check so she
could send it to the IRS as proof of payment.
</P>
<P>
   The bank person said we'd have it within two days. Two weeks
passed, and no check. She spent another half morning punching
telephone buttons and listening to elevator music. When she finally
got to talk to a real person she was told the bank had no record of
our request for a canceled check. Since the IRS was making ominous
threats, she drove to the bank to plead her case. She got the copy
of the canceled check, and the bank's explanation of the IRS
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to keep the IRS at arm's length, we issued power of
attorney to Freeman. By certified mail, he sent the IRS: 1. Our
bank statement reflecting the IRS error. 2. The bank's explanation
of the error. 3. The location of the $6,300 in the Federal Reserve
Bank. 4. A photostatic copy of the canceled $7,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later we got a notice from the IRS informing us that
if we did not pay delinquent taxes immediately they were going to
seize our checking account and file federal liens on any and all of
our property.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy immediately called the IRS to again inform them that we
don't owe any money. After checking our file, the IRS person
informed him there was no record of having received any money from
us, and no record of hearing from either him, or from us. As they
talked, Sammy was holding in his hand the little green card from
the post office showing where the IRS had received, and signed for,
his certified letter.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded until they promised not to seize our bank account and
put liens on all our property. We were not heartened to read a
newspaper story reporting that, according to its own internal
audit, the IRS improperly seized property from taxpayers in more
than 25 percent of cases studied in fiscal 1997. Sure enough, we
soon received another friendly letter. With continuing penalties
and interest, we now owe $6,519. 83. The letter said pay
immediately, or we'll seize your paycheck, bank account, auto and
other property.
</P>
<P>
   This may signal the end of a checkered column-writing career. To
my knowledge, the Journal-Constitution has never had a
correspondent domiciled in a federal penitentiary, and I don't know
if they would make an exception in my case.
</P>
<P>
   Going way back
</P>
<P>
   It was 1925, not 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After my mention of the record drought year of 1929 a couple of
weeks ago, I got a call from my Uncle Donald Harp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're four years off,'' he said. ``The dry year was 1925.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was. I must have been thinking of another calamity,
the stock market crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Griffin pointed out that '29 actually was a wet year.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and columnists depend on careful copy editors like
Sharon Bailey to pick up their fumbles. But how would even Sharon
Bailey know whether it was wet or dry in 1925?
</P>
<P>
   If newspapers are going to let senile people write columns, they
ought to hire alert senior citizens to keep them from making stupid
errors.

 &HT;    Schools anticipate a steamy first month
 &HT;    By Andy Alford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While most students are stocking up on school
supplies, Austin school bus driver Ida Collins is freezing bottles
of water in preparation for the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Collins will take the frozen bottles with her on her twice-daily
drives and drink the water as it melts. She'll also soak a bandana
or towel in ice water to wear around her neck. And now and again,
she'll get a little relief from a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are so sweet,'' Collins said. ``They'll bring you
iced tea or lemonade or water.'' Collins hopes it will all work to
help her beat the heat that has throttled Central Texas all summer.
When school starts next week, the Austin area may still be in the
clutches of a heat wave that has produced a marathon of
near-record, triple-digit days.
</P>
<P>
   Local meteorologists say it probably won't cool off until
September. Until then, students will trudge to and from school
beneath blazing skies, swelter on school buses without air
conditioning and sweat their way through outdoor athletic
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of summer,'' said Larry Lewis, an area
superintendent for the Austin school district. He said overtaxed
air conditioners at several Austin schools have quit this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working feverishly to get them back on,'' he said.
``And it's expected that they will be on when school starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at Murchison Middle School held their breath as
maintenance staff labored until 5 a.m. Wednesday to get their air
conditioning back up at the Northwest Austin school. The cooling
unit failed while the school was being rewired and the unit had to
be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``So from this day forward we are up and running and doing
fine,'' Murchison Principal Lynda Redler said.
</P>
<P>
   Some physical education teachers and athletic coaches have
scheduled exercise indoors when possible. When athletes must take
to the field, many coaches have scheduled sports activities for
early morning or in the evening to dodge the afternoon heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea to have your water bottle with you. My dad
insists that I bring it,'' said Jennifer Pohl, who was on the
Westlake High track at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Pohl is a West Ridge
eighth-grade hurdler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early morning is not too bad, but around mid-day it starts to
get pretty tough,'' said Hays Junior High Principal Dan Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Hays coaches and physical trainers take care to keep
football players hydrated with juice, water and Gatorade, as many
youngsters aren't used to toting the full 30-pound armament of
football padding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be competitive, but that's not everything,'' Murphy
said. ``We have to look at the interest of the kids first _ it's
going to be a pretty long season, and they'll be around a lot
longer if we don't kill them first.''
</P>
<P>
   Some elementary schools are considering indoor or early morning
recesses. Karen Sisler, principal of Faubion Elementary in the
Leander school district, said teachers may bring coolers of ice
water to recess because the school has no outside water fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Faubion worked around the smoky haze alerts at the end of the
last school year, Sisler said. ``This will probably be the same
kind of thing. We'll probably have a hot weather room for kids _
just like for cold days and rainy days when parents request that
they don't go outside _ and have puzzles and board games.''
</P>
<P>
   After school, some students will have to hope for a quick ride
home. Newer buses have tinted windows and white roofs to reflect
the sun's rays. But most school buses, which can hold up to 72
children, don't come with air conditioning. Only those equipped to
carry special education students, some of whom can be susceptible
to seizures when it's hot, have air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the famous 40-50 air conditioning system: You roll all
40 windows down and drive 50 miles per hour,'' joked Fred Filley,
Austin's assistant director of pupil transportation. ``It's a never
ending battle with the heat.''

 &HT;    La Salle shipwreck ID runs aground
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A centuries-old shipwreck whose discovery last February
off the Texas coast excited historians is not the long-lost
flagship of French explorer La Salle as initially thought, state
officials announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it may be a Spanish warship 100 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artifacts that were initially recovered from the site
looked to be of the right era for this to have been the l'Aimable,
but subsequent research shows it is not,'' said Jim Bruseth,
director of antiquities protection for the Texas Historical
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The l'Aimable is still the crown jewel, and it's still
missing. We intend to continue looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the initial theory that the wreck was l'Aimable
(pronounced luh-MAB-luh) unraveled in recent weeks as state divers
recovered additional artifacts from the site, and tests conducted
at a Texas A&AMP;M University lab confirmed they were much more recent
than Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.
</P>
<P>
   Bruseth said copper sheathing was found on remnants of the hull,
a shipbuilding technique that dates to the mid-1700s, long after La
Salle's ship sank in 1685.
</P>
<P>
   A musket initially thought to be French in origin and from La
Salle's era has since been determined to be a perfect match for a
1752 Spanish firearm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bayonets and other firearms recovered from the shipwreck site in
recent weeks are characteristic of the mid- to late-1700s, Bruseth
said. And an 18-pound cannonball was found on board, much heavier
than one La Salle's ship would have carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've answered the question of whether this is
L'Aimable. It's not,'' Bruseth said. ``It appears to be a Spanish
warship. and several Spanish ships ran aground in this area during
that period. The Spanish were continuing to patrol this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreck was discovered Feb. 23 by divers from the the
privately funded National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), who
identified it as l'Aimable based on X-rays of a flintlock and a
musket found amid the ship's remains _ both identified as French,
from the mid-1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gronquist, an Austin attorney who is president of the
maritime history group, said he thinks the historical commission is
right. ``We're disappointed, but what this means is that l'Aimable
is still out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Best-selling author Clive Cussler, who founded NUMA, said
Wednesday he is ready to renew the search for l'Aimable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has looked for it for 17 years and has not been able
to find it,'' he said. ``I know we can. If they'll only let us come
back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical accounts show l'Aimable ran aground in February 1685
while trying to enter Matagorda Bay, which some historians think La
Salle mistook for the mouth of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found just outside Cavallo Pass, the narrow
passageway that connects the Gulf of Mexico with Matagorda Bay near
the present day town of Port O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   L'Aimable, a broad-hulled cargo vessel, was among four ships
that carried La Salle and more than 300 colonists to the New World
in 1684 to establish a French colony at the mouth of the
Mississippi and to lay claim to the vast adjacent lands for France.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck of a smaller ship in La Salle's fleet, La Belle, was
located about three years ago by state archaeologists in Matagorda
Bay. La Belle ran aground in January 1686, when a storm blew it
across the bay into shallow water near the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   After La Salle landed in Texas, he was met with a hostile
climate, belligerent natives and disease. A handful of people led
by La Salle left on foot in 1687 and headed inland, hoping to find
the Mississippi. But he subsequently wound up being murdered by his
own men.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun County Judge Howard Hartzog, who earlier hailed the
discovery of La Salle's missing ship as a world-class find, said he
was disappointed by the new finding _ but remains hopeful the
Spanish wreck will yield important artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's a Spanish ship, it's still pretty old. And it's
still significant in the history of this area,'' Hartzog said.
``The site should be fully investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruseth said state officials have no plans to undertake a major
archaeology project at the wreck site _ something Hartzog said he
intends to press for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want to do it, I'll find someone who will,'' he
said. ``Whoever's ship this was, we need to know as much as we can
about it. It's part of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical Commission officials said attempts will continue to
identify the ship, using the 50 to 75 other artifacts recovered
from the site _ from pig iron and stones that were used as ballast
to a piece of ``bar stock'' _ an hourglass-shaped piece of metal
that was fired from cannons to destroy another ship's rigging.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruseth rates the chance at doing so at ``about 50-50. ``If
it's not one of the wrecks that was documented, we may never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   After the wreck site was discovered, Gov. George W. Bush
approved a grant of $132,000 to pay for underwater research.
Bruseth said less than $10,000 was spent before the determination
was made that the ship was not l'Aimable.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog said he hopes that Wednesday's anouncement will not slow
the search for l'Aimable, an effort that state and private divers
have unsuccessfully pursued for almost three decades. Curtis
Tunnell, executive director of the state historical commission,
said it will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 36 historic shipwrecks in the Matagorda
Bay vicinity,'' he said. ``(The agency) intends to continue working
with NUMA, Calhoun and Matagorda counties to investigate the area
in an ongoing effort to locate the Aimable.''

<P>
   The media hounds him a bit less. Calls from desperate cancer
patients have subsided _ now a mere hundred or so daily, down from
over 1,000 a day during what some staff members call ``Folkman
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in mid-May, when an overwrought newspaper story about
the potential of two novel cancer drugs from Dr. Judah Folkman's
laboratory at Children's Hospital touched off a media frenzy that's
still resonating.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, while stunningly effective in mice, have yet to be
tested in a single human, and won't be until sometime next year.
Nevertheless, cancer patients everywhere wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publicity ended up causing difficulties,'' says Dr. Elise
Kohn at the National Cancer Institute. ``I've been inundated with
calls from patients demanding to be treated with these `miracle'
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Folkman, who pioneered the radical strategy of cutting off
the blood supply of tumors instead of attacking the cancer
directly, is easing back into his routine while acknowledging that
the premature publicity has complicated his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to work under the spotlight,'' said Folkman in a
rare interview. While confident that the two drugs _ angiostatin
and endostatin _ will bring something new and important to cancer
therapy, he frets about the unrealistically high expectations that
have now been created.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are failures'' in early tests of drugs, even
those that eventually prove valuable, Folkman says. ``And,'' he
worries, ``the failures are magnified (by critics) to mean the
whole field won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Folkman is all too aware of potential criticism, having endured
it for 30 years during his lonely crusade to show that tumors, in
order to grow, must recruit new blood vessels from the tissues
around them, and that attacking this blood supply could halt or
shrink cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has been largely vindicated: Angiogenesis, the process of
forming new blood vessels from existing ones, is accepted as a
crucial step in cancer, and he and others have found a long list of
substances, including angiostatin and endostatin, that block
angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   In mice, a combination of angiostatin and endostatin has shrunk
large lung cancers to invisibility _ and without apparent side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   While time has not yet proven Folkman correct that angiogenesis
inhibitors will write a new chapter in cancer treatment, many
believe that day is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Starving tumors with angiogenesis blockers is ``probably the
most exciting anticancer therapy out there right now,'' says Robert
Weinberg, a leading cancer researcher at the Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge. But, ``there are some very substantial problems'' in
turning the findings into useful therapies, among them difficulty
manufacturing the complicated proteins in quantitites large enough
to test _ let alone market _ if they prove to be useful in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``my judgment is that it's going to work
eventually,'' Weinberg says, predicting that the drugs will enter
clinical use in five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 angiogenesis inhibitors are already in early-stage
clinical trials, according to the Boston-based Angiogenesis
Foundation. But they are first-generation drugs, far less potent
than angiostatin and endostatin, discovered in 1994 and 1995. The
current tests aren't expected to yield dramatic results, because,
as with all new drugs, they are being tested first in the sickest
cancer patients. In fact, the preliminary results have been mixed:
Some of the inhibitors have caused dramatic improvement in a small
number of patients, while others have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trials swamped with volunteers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the wave of publicity in May, however, even these trials
of less potent angiogenesis inhibitors have been swamped with more
volunteers than they can take. Folkman and others agonize over
having to tell desperate patients that until one or more of these
drugs is proven safe and effective, access to them will be
extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin and endostatin are being hurried as quickly as
possible toward their first tests in humans by scientists at the
National Cancer Institute and a Maryland biotech company, EntreMed,
Inc., which has licensed the drugs for development from Children's
Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is hope that in a year to 18 months there will
be enough of this material'' to begin testing in a small number of
patients, says Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Holaday, CEO of EntreMed, said recently that the
company's goal is to match the speed record for moving a drug from
initial discovery to approval for widespread use _ about seven
years. That would put endostatin and angiostatin on the market in
about five years if they prove effective in people, but this is
predicated on ``zero error and flawless execution'' in
manufacturing and winning regulatory approval, Holaday
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Under the relentless scrutiny of patients, doctors, and the
stock market, the odyssey of endostatin and angiostatin may turn
into one of the most closely-watched chapters yet in the war on
cancer. And these two potent angiogenesis inhibitors are not the
end of the line _ Folkman and his colleagues have recently found
two more inhibitors, one of them named vasculostatin; neither has
even been tested yet in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is still bemused by the recent media attention,
Folkman says the recent hubbub has had ``one positive effect: I've
had many calls from senior people at drug companies across the
world saying they've considered establishing angiogenesis units but
thought it was too early. Now they're asking if it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this enterprise lie in many years of painstaking
research by Folkman and his colleagues, who now occupy a large
laboratory in the Enders research building at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, whose single-minded focus on angiogenesis grew out of
research he did in the Navy and later as a surgeon at Children's,
came to believe that a solid tumor couldn't grow without getting
the body to extend new blood vessels to nourish it.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't sound like a radical idea now, but Folkman's hunch
was long rejected.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Advice to Joe Clinton
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about everybody seems to think President Clinton should
confess, though they are foggy about exactly what to, and since I'm
as ignorant as they are about what really went on, I figure I'm
qualified to put my two cents' worth in, too. So here's what I
think the president should do. I wish he'd call up Kenneth Starr
and say:
</P>
<P>
   You know, you've been saying _ and scoring all sorts of points
with the courts by saying it _ that the president is just like any
other Joe. He gets no legal slack. Anybody wants to sue him, sue
away. Anyone he talks to who isn't his wife or personal attorney,
haul 'em in and given 'em the third degree. I guess any cop on the
beat can ticket the whole shebang if a presidential motorcade pulls
out of the White House without a parade permit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if I'm just Joe Citizen with a swank address, then I'm no
less than Joe Citizen, either. So I've been thinking and I've
decided not to testify to your grand jury after all. You've been
out to get me for four years. Nobody in their right mind would walk
into a trap like that, and most prosecutors wouldn't even bother
asking them to. You think you can get away with it because it would
be too politically embarrassing for me to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   I'm refusing. And if you issue a subpoena, as far as I'm
concerned you can shove it in the nearest pigeonhole because I'm
gonna pay no more attention to it than I do those fliers for
Chinese takeout. Try forcing the matter and I'll take the Fifth
Amendment, just as any other Joe would do in the circumstances. In
fact, as any lawyer who bills more than $1.98 an hour would insist
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater was one thing. It was old news and small potatoes,
but I signed off on that investigation myself, figuring you'd run
though the paperwork, say your say and close up shop. But nooooo.
Somehow, you wound up spending two years investigating Vince
Foster's death after three law enforcement agencies already had,
before finally deciding Vince really killed himself and neither
Hillary nor I had shot him or had hired some gunsel to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Then you got yourself into so-called Travelgate and Filegate,
two screw-ups early in my administration that had zero to do with
any constitutional issues of the office. And then, then!, you
started asking around about women I've known and, like a lunatic
oil spot, finally managed to spread yourself into the Paula Jones
case and come up with Monica Lewinsky as a Judas goat.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny, frankly, my personal life is none of your damn business.
Actually, come to think of it, bloodhound breath, you're fired.
Write up what you've got to say about Whitewater and the -gates,
file your report and close your boiler room. I'm shutting down your
racket.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take my chances with a real jury of Joes and Janes just
like me and see what they make of a case about disputed testimony
that was ruled irrelevant in a civil case the judge threw out as
groundless, a case based now on stuff you wrung out of a young
woman by threatening to send her and her mom to prison _ her mom! _
if she didn't change her tune.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect a regular Joe like me might do just fine with other
regular folks on that one.

 UNDATED: ... long rejected.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think part of it was other peoples' perception that
angiogenesis was going to be a trivial consequence'' of other
events in a tumor's progression, says Douglas Hanahan, a researcher
at the University of California at San Francisco and longtime
Folkman collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scientific means to study blood-vessel formation in
detail didn't exist, Folkman was many years in proving his case.
But in time, he and others were able to show that angiogenesis is a
crucial, and early, step in a tumor's career. If the tumor doesn't
succeed in recruiting new blood-vessel support, it is doomed to
remain ``in situ'' _ a small, harmless knot of cells unable to
invade healthy tissue &UR;  &LR; or metastasize.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why angiogenesis is so crucial for tumor growth,
imagine a small town beside a large highway that has no exit
nearby. The few houses and a store or two can get along fine with
this arrangement. But if the town wants to grow, there's a
logistical problem. As the town expands in all directions, trucks
can't make deliveries to the center of town. Without a network of
new roads connecting the highway and the buildings, the middle of
town will figuratively die.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with tumors. To grow beyond the size of a pea,
Folkman proposed, the tumor has to induce nearby blood vessels to
grow new capillaries _ vessels thinner than a hair _ to reach into
and entwine the cancer cells. This is angiogenesis, and it has
recently been shown to occur not only in the growth of solid tumors
but even in leukemia, a blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis is a normal process that also occurs during
development and childhood, and in adults in menstruation and
wound-healing. The question Folkman asked was, how do tumors induce
the body to send out new capillaries? He reasoned that tumors must
send some sort of chemical signal _ and he proved correct.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, he and colleagues in his laboratory
discovered what would be the first of a number of ``angiogenic''
substances that serve as ``on'' signals for new capillary growth. A
few years later, he found the first of numerous inhibitors of
angiogenesis _ ``off'' signals in the process. It appears the body,
and tumors themselves, make these competing substances as part of
an on-off system to regulate normal new blood-vessel growth. Most
recently, Folkman and others have discovered that a tumor's
angiogenic switch goes on when the pro-angiogenesis signals
outweigh the inhibitory ones.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a momentous discovery that tied together angiogenesis
and the burgeoning field of cancer genetics _ the finding by Noel
Bouck at Northwestern University Medical School that a
tumor-suppressing gene called P53, which normally keeps cancer from
arising, works in part by switching on an inhibitor of
angiogenesis. A defective P53 permits angiogenesis to take place,
making cancer more likely to develop.
</P>
<P>
   The list of different substances that block angiogenesis is
already long, and growing. It includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Thalidomide, the infamous morning-sickness drug that caused
severe birth defects in the early '60s;
</P>
<P>
   _A form of interferon and a form of interleukin, both substances
in the immune system;
</P>
<P>
   _Angiostatin and endostatin. Discovered by Dr. Michael O'Reilly
in Folkman's laboratory, they are fragments of larger proteins
found in the body;
</P>
<P>
   _Monoclonal antibodies made in the lab to block a chemical
messenger called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which
induces endothelial cells to divide and form new vessels.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why tumors produce substances that inhibit
angiogenesis as well as others that promote it. But the phenomenon
may explain why metastases, cancer cells that have escaped the
original tumor and lodged elsewhere in the body, often grow rapidly
after the primary tumor is removed. &UR;  &LR; Whatever the explanation, it
is good fortune for cancer therapy that these potent vessel
growth-blockers exist. And their discovery has reversed years of
disbelief that dogged Folkman: He is now considered almost a
shoo-in for a Nobel Prize, particularly if the angiogenesis
inhibitors have a major impact on cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judah is a visionary, and as such, very few people understood
the message he was trying to project,'' says Isaiah (Josh) Fidler,
a cell biologist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston
who also does research on angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last fall that Folkman reported results of the most
dramatic experiment of his career. Using a combination of
angiostatin and endostatin, he and his colleagues were able to
shrink large tumors and mestastases in mice to the point of
undetectability, and they remained microscopic indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the drugs didn't lose their effect over time. That was
an unprecedented result.
</P>
<P>
   While Folkman and the rest of the world await the first human
trials of angiostatin and endostatin, researchers are developing
numerous twists on the basic theme.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, an experiment reported in the journal Nature
Genetics showed that angiostatin combined with radiation treatment
shrank tumors in mice far more effectively than either agent alone.
Folkman hailed the work as laying the foundation for a new form of
radiation treatment that could be more potent without causing
additional side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Folkman and others continue to emphasize that none of this
good news has meaning for human patients until the drugs prove
themselves in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The first-generation, relatively weak inhibitors that have made
it into human testing haven't performed like miracle drugs, but
there have been some tantalizing results.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a team from M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute reported
that a woman with metastatic cervical cancer who received an
angiogenesis blocker called TNP-470 for 22 months in 1995 went into
complete remission of her disease _ and suffered few side effects.
Such remissions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging responses to angiogenesis inhibitors have also been
seen in trials carried out at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
other centers.
</P>
<P>
   In some brain tumor patients, the drugs shrank or halted the
cancer for many months. ``There are some long-term survivors, but
we don't know what this means,'' because of the small numbers of
cases, says Dr. Howard Fine, a brain tumor specialist at
Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of anticancer effect in some cases, he says,
which is ``proof of principle that using an entirely different
approach to cancer therapy we can actually cause regression of
human cancer. That's exciting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fine, like many in the field, remains cautious: ``I don't
believe this will be the magic bullet. You need to attack a tumor
on many fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Folkman agrees. He believes the inhibitors likely will be teamed
with radiation and chemotherapy and their first achievements will
be to reduce side effects and a tumors' ability to be
drug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much-abused ``c'' word _ cure _ that is not yet in
the lexicon of angiogenesis researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanahan, the San Francisco researcher, puts it this way: ``There
is no question in my mind that angiogenesis is an incredibly
exciting target, and that we are going to develop very effective
treatments that have a major impact on the ability of tumors to
grow new blood vessels. But is a particular compound going to cure
cancer? It seems improbable to me.''

 &HT;    Mauro claims support of 49 Hispanic mayors
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry Mauro
recently trumpeted endorsements from 49 Hispanic mayors, including
one who said he is not a Mauro man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strong show of support from elected officials will help
our campaign win the Hispanic vote by a record margin,'' Mauro said
in Edinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Texas Poll indicates otherwise. In June, the poll _
which showed Republican Gov. George W. Bush with a 53-point overall
lead _ showed the incumbent with a 67 percent to 20 percent edge
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has said there is no chance the Hispanic vote will look
anything like that on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On almost every major issue of importance to Hispanics,
Governor Bush is on the wrong side,'' he said. ``Hispanic mayors
have joined my campaign because they know that Governor Bush can't
be counted on to look out for the interests of Texas families.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters, despite traditionally low turnouts, have long
been a dependable cog in the Democratic machine in Texas. Bush,
however, has targeted the Hispanic community as one in which he can
score well.
</P>
<P>
   The list of mayors backing Mauro include many from small South
Texas cities, as well as some from somewhat larger cities such as
Alice, Del Rio, Edinburg and Presidio. Manor Mayor Joe Sanchez is
the only Central Texas mayor on the list.
</P>
<P>
   One mayor on the Mauro list, Raul Diaz of San Elizario in El
Paso County, said he should not have been included. For the first
time in his life, Diaz is backing the GOP nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has done a lot for the people here,'' Diaz said of
Bush. ``I think he is a governor for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro campaign manager Billy Rogers said Diaz had assured the
Mauro staff he was backing the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Another mayor on Mauro's list, Arnoldo Cantu of Freer, also
signed a form indicating he is endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has taken to speaking in Spanish at many
campaign stops, has made repeated trips to El Paso to tap into the
Hispanic vote there.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez is a Bush backer, as are the
Hispanic mayors of Los Fresnos, San Diego, Harlingen and
Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has worked hard to earn the support of Texans
across the state and will keep doing so,'' said Mindy Tucker,
Bush's campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro insists Hispanics will not like what Bush has to offer on
various topics. The challenger cited Bush's proposal to use
statewide exams to determine if third-, fifth-, and eighth-graders
are promoted, as well as Bush's position on bilingual education.
Bush has said he is awaiting results of new state exams to
determine whether bilingual education is successful.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also said Hispanics should question Bush's conditional
support for placing a low-level radioactive waste dump at a West
Texas site near Sierra Blanca. Mauro claims the location violates a
treaty with Mexico, and he has said he would kill the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce
political action committee also recently announced its backing for
Republican candidates for all top statewide offices.

 HOUSTON: ... side effects.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now, scientists are developing drugs aimed at blocking the
effects of mutant, cancer-causing oncogenes, restoring broken
tumor-suppressor genes, and overcoming malfunctioning DNA-repair
genes. They hope these therapies will bring outlaw cancer cells
back into good behavior or prod irrevocably damaged cells into
apoptosis, or cell suicide.
</P>
<P>
   If conventional chemo is like bombing an entire city to kill off
a guerrilla force, the newer drugs aim to pick off the enemy and
spare the civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many ways to attack cancer,'' says Coffey.
Indeed, a survey this year by an industry group showed that of 350
biotech drugs under development, 151 _ more than one-third _ target
cancer. There were 30 for melanoma alone, 20 for colo-rectal
cancer, and 13 each for prostate and breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
   And, as reports at this spring's meeting of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology reflected, the early tests of many of these
agents are promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many positive results in my life,'' says
Dr. Dan Von Hoff, founder of ILEX Pharmaceuticals and an oncologist
at the San Antonio Cancer Institute. ``The biology is beginning to
pay off. Now you can sit down and look a patient in the eye and say
there's a good chance of this doing you good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a flurry of media reports this spring proclaiming that a
cancer ``cure'' might be at hand, few scientists will touch that
word. Sobered by decades of experience with cancer's Houdini-like
ability to escape and survive, researchers say the new agents may
realistically prove more successful at taming cancer than
destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have cures someday,'' says Samuel Waksal, president of
ImClone Systems Inc. in New York, which is developing targeted
cancer therapies, ``but the types of approaches we're developing
now may make cancer a chronic disease. We would like to kill every
cancer cell, but we're recognizing that if you can keep people
alive for 30 more years, using drugs with few side effects _ that's
pretty dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he adds, ``that's a goal that is achievable in the near
term.'' Even in the next two or three years, ``the world (of cancer
treatment) is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   For ethical reasons, the newest drugs are tried first in
patients with hopelessly advanced cancer. Despite the grim odds,
one such drug is already sparking a glimmer of hope for patients
with aggressive, incurable brain tumors called glioblastomas. The
drug, called SU101, blocks an overactive cell growth-signaling
pathway in brain cells and has kept a few patients alive for one or
two years. Under normal circumstances, they would have died within
three months, says Dr. Eric Wong, a neuro-oncologist at Boston's
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where the drug is about to
begin testing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nelba MacMurdo, 66, of Canton, finished her first
seven-week course of SU-101: Her children had read about the
experimental drug in a newsmagazine and sought out Wong. Whether it
has affected the brain tumor whose tentacles couldn't be surgically
removed wasn't immediately clear. But her daughter, Leslie, says
she has experienced few side effects and has felt ``renewed zest
just knowing there's something that could potentially help her.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects any of the new biological therapies, as effective
as they may prove, to do the job alone. Most researchers believe
they will work best when combined with other therapies and with
standard chemotherapy drugs to attack the elusive cancer cell on
many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to hit a home run to cure people'' with newer
agents, says Dr. Christopher Logothetis at M.D. Anderson. ``We just
have to get a base hit, because we already have one with
chemotherapy _ this could give us a run batted in. That's why many
of us are really optimistic that we're going to be able to change
the course of this illness.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, ImClone's cancer drug C225, based on an antibody
discovery by Mendelsohn, is being tested in combination with
radiation for head and neck cancers. The radiation damages the cell
while the C225 antibody blocks a chemical growth factor, the EGF
receptor, that the cell needs in order to divide. The one-two
attack has proven successful in halting tumors in the early tests,
says Mendelsohn.
</P>
<P>
   If they are cautiously optimistic that the new era of rationally
designed drugs and targeted therapies may yield major inroads into
the disease, the researchers are also mindful of the potential
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Normal cells in body tissues are of one kind, but cancer cells _
even in the same tumor _ are genetically diverse, points out Coffey
at Johns Hopkins. ``Diversity allows cancer to survive'' by
becoming resistant to drugs that attack just one type of cell, he
says. ``Cancer is an evolutionary process that spins off variants
you can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors may get around this obstacle because
they don't attack the cancer cell itself, only its blood supply,
and the blood vessel cells that are the target don't develop
resistance. In animal experiments, resistance to the angiogenesis
agents has been remarkably absent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hurdles remain before drugs reach market
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are other hurdles. Turning experimental proteins from
the laboratory into commercial-scale drugs is difficult. Many of
the proteins are large, complex, and difficult to make. Genentech
is building a new manufacturing plant to churn out a drug called
Herceptin for what is expected to be a large market, once it gains
FDA approval. But these scale-ups take time and effort. Moreover,
large proteins need to be taken intravenously; the hope is to
produce small molecules that patients can take orally.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers still labor to find better ways to test
promising drugs in animals. Though scientists have worked for years
to create mice that mimic human cancer, mice experiments still
often don't predict what a drug will do in humans, and the search
for still better animal models continues.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dr. Martin Abeloff, director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer
Center, ``We're all excited about the potential of really being
able to attack this disease in a more scientifically-based
approach. But we also have to be cautious, because we're learning
about the complexity of these processes.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, it's not as if cancer treatment is moving into a
``different universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like what we've done in the past'' with
conventional treatments will be rendered obsolete, he says. ``We'll
never abandon them, even when we have the new biologically _ based
approaches... we'll use them together.''

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ As I recall, it was Marcel Proust, the French

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Based on government data just released for the
first 11 months of last year, 1997 will almost certainly be the
first year since statistics have been tracked in which fewer
Americans died of cancer than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was small, but it happened even though the nation's
population grew by 2.5 million and the average age continued to
climb. Coming on top of six straight years of decline in the
per-capita rate of cancer deaths _ and with that rate now falling
faster than ever _ the drop in total deaths is being called a
momentous turning point in the battle against the dreaded disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of the payoff,'' says David S.
Rosenthal, president of the American Cancer Society and director of
Harvard University Health Services. ``And in my rose-colored
glasses, I think we'll see even better trends downward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Cole, a professor of epidemiology at the University
of Alabama at Birmingham and a national authority on tracking
cancer trends, is even more upbeat: ``Not only is the rate of
cancer deaths coming down every year, but the rate of decline is
accelerating.... Of all the decline that has occurred since 1991,
almost one-third of it has occurred in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable, says Cole, is the finding that ``for the
first time in history, the actual number of deaths by cancer in
this country is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of frustration and doubt, the hard numbers seem to
be documenting that improvements in chemotherapy, radiation, and
surgery _ along with more effective prevention _ are making real
inroads against cancer, even as researchers make the most promising
strides yet in their search for cures. The statistics offer hope
that the coming years will see cancer at last follow the trend of
heart disease, whose toll has dropped dramatically over 25 years,
although it remains America's leading killer.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are contained in the latest monthly mortality
reports prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The reports include 23 additional months of data since federal
officials announced in March the first downturn in over 20 years in
rates of &UR;  &LR; cancer incidence, covering the period 1990 to 1995, as
well as continued progress on death rates. It will be at least a
month before the government finishes analyzing the new information,
which covers January 1996 through November 1997, but Cole and key
federal officials say some trends already are apparent.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the rate at which Americans are dying of all
cancers combined continued to fall during those 23 months. That
makes nearly six consecutive years of declines, in stark contrast
to the way rates rose inexorably from 1973 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, adjusted for the rising age of the population, was
just .6 percent in 1996, Cole says. But over the first 11 months of
1997 cancer death rates fell by 2 percent _ and the actual number
of deaths fell by 1 percent, from 497,110 during that period the
year before, to 491,350.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 23 months of data must be refined before they are
released in final form, but the recent trend suggests the final
figures will reflect even ``more decline,'' says Harry M.
Rosenberg, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC's National
Center for Health Statistics. ``What we can say with this is that
the cancer trend overall has continued to decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   The death-rate decline cuts across most major types of cancer,
with the biggest drop in breast cancer _ nearly 8 percent. There
were modest decreases in cancers of the respiratory and digestive
organs and genitals. There were more modest increases in cancers of
the urinary organs and the lymphatic and blood tissues. Those rates
reflect the number of deaths per 100,000 people, based on a
nationwide sample of 10 percent of the death certificates filed
with states during that period.
</P>
<P>
   The rates for the last month of 1997 are not available yet, but
Cole says it is inconceivable that a single month's data could
reverse the trend of the previous 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not known precisely what is driving the drop in
deaths, one clear factor is that Americans are getting better at
detecting cancer early, when it is easiest to contain, says Brenda
K. Edwards, associate director of surveillance research at the
National Cancer Institute. Another key, says Rosenberg, is the
decline in smoking, especially among men.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a role better treatment plays is more controversial.
Dr. John Bailar, chairman of the Department of Health Studies at
the University of Chicago and a leading critic of the cancer
establishment, says the lion's share of credit goes to Pap smears
and other early-detection techniques, along with campaigns against
tobacco and other carcinogens. The only place where treatment has
produced compelling results, he adds, is with cancer of the colon
and rectum, along with cancers in children.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the NCI, insists that
better ways of delivering chemotherapy and radiation are a big
reason death rates are going down for cancers of the breast and
other organs. ``I can list a whole number of pretty significant
types of cancer where survival is increasing,'' he says. ``The
ability to preserve organs or function, or control side effects of
disease and therapy, have significantly improved in the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Former cancer patient Laurel Simmons of Cambridge doesn't feel a
need to choose between treatment and prevention. Simmons is a
strong advocate of prevention, but she says she stands as personal
proof that treatment saves lives, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am part of the process of bringing those rates
down,'' says the 36-year-old graduate student at the Harvard School
of Public Health, who was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous
leukemia in 1987, had a relapse in 1990, but is symptom-free today
after receiving a bone marrow transplant and other state-of-the-art
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my life to this vast scientific complex that really does
produce some lifesaving results at the end of the day,'' she says.
``When we see data about cancer rates coming down I guess it means
all those folks are making progress. It's really wonderful.''

<P>
   Jeannine Bibeau is feeling miserable.
</P>
<P>
   It is just hours since she had a walnut-sized tumor cut out of
her esophagus. Her doctors have done all they can, giving her drugs
for the pain and running tubes to her lungs and stomach. But
Roberta Raskin's work is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   She slowly moves her hands along Bibeau's body, her fingers
within inches of her patient's skin yet never touching it. As a
therapeutic healer, Raskin's job is to calm an ``energy field''
only she can feel, bringing Bibeau back into balance with the
metaphysical universe.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual healing like this has been going on for centuries, but
it's hardly what you'd expect in the high-tech halls of
Massachusetts General Hospital. Yet it's happening there and in
other temples of traditional medicine, as therapists who deal with
things they can't see, hear, or sometimes even name increasingly
are working yards away from doctors who deal with things they can
cut, stitch, and count.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to beat back patients' demands for alternative therapies,
mainstream medicine in America is trying a new tack: making those
therapies available itself. And nowhere is that change more
profound, or more confounding, than in cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer doctors today are reciting the mantra of ``complementary
therapies'' much as they proclaim the once-scorned virtues of
prevention. Once the chanting stops, however, confusion often sets
in over which complementary treatments doctors can recommend with
confidence that they actually work, or that they at least provide
psychic relief without doing harm. There also is confusion about
whether physicians trained in western medicine are competent to
judge therapies that derive from decidedly different traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a lot of people are using these therapies, let's get the
best clinical trial people in the country to do rigorous trials
that sift out what's helpful from what's not helpful,'' advises Dr.
Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health. ``And
let's do it without any preconceptions about what might work and
what won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But many cancer patients can't wait, and don't see why they
should. ``I don't really care if doctors say it works,'' says
Catherine Kerr of Cambridge, Mass., who is using qi gong, a Chinese
system of breathing and exercise, to help her deal with her
multiple myeloma, a cancer that lodges in the bone marrow for which
there are treatments, but no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western doctors,'' she says, ``are hugely important. They
monitor my biochemistry really closely. But there's just this whole
other level of illness that they don't really know that much about,
and patients have to look for that knowledge elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Prevention moves to the forefront
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People also are often on their own when they look for ways to
prevent cancer from starting, although that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   Until this century, prevention was the hallmark of medicine's
approach to battling disease, whether it was tuberculosis or
malaria, diphtheria or dysentery. Long before there were cures,
doctors and nurses looked for ways to avoid illness, from better
hygiene to vaccines to quarantining the sick to stop the spread of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In the war on cancer, however, prevention generally took a back
seat to the search for treatments and cures. You could see that at
the National Cancer Institute, where prevention-related activity
typically received considerably less money than treatment, although
the gap has closed in recent years. And you could hear it in
conversations with doctors, for whom prevention generally was an
afterthought, albeit one they now strongly endorse.
</P>
<P>
   That was partly a matter of politics: It is difficult to take on
the tobacco companies and other powerful interests whose products
promote cancer-causing behavior, and it is hotly disputed how much
factors like industrial pollutants are to blame. It's also a matter
of practicality: Cancer doctors generally see patients after
they've got the disease, primary-care doctors generally feel more
comfortable dispensing treatments than educating patients about
healthier ways of behaving, and patients often won't listen even
when they get such advice. And, of course, little was known about
what causes many types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those impediments, the focus on prevention is
intensifying. Based in part on the way the drop in smoking
nationwide has led to a drop in lung cancer rates, health officials
now conclude that more than 50 percent of cancer can be prevented
by applying what we know about its causes.
</P>
<P>
   Any discussion of cancer prevention still has to start with
smoking, which continues to account for about 30 percent of cancer
deaths in America. And it's not just the lungs that tobacco
attacks, but the mouth, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney,
pancreas, head, neck, and colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we took all the other reliably known effects, and added
them all up, it probably wouldn't add up to 50 percent of the
number of cancer deaths caused by smoking,'' says Richard Peto, a
professor of medical statistics at the University of Oxford whose
population studies were among the first to cement the link between
tobacco and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're putting perhaps too much emphasis on kids. It's
easy politically to say, `Let's try to avoid companies deliberately
encouraging kids from getting into smoking.' But that's only part
of an appropriate way to reduce deaths from tobacco,'' Peto says.
``Stopping smoking even in middle age you can avoid most of the
risk.''

<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ To most cancer doctors, a breast tumor is a poison
that must be removed as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But to Dr. Herbert M. Pinedo, it's also its own potential
antidote.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the tumor turn on itself. Pinedo came to
that radical concept after watching survival rates climb by 25
percent when, before operating, he gave women with large tumors
chemotherapy treatments large enough and for long enough to
substantially shrink the growths. That meant putting off surgery, a
prospect that would have alarmed most oncologists. But Pinedo
thinks the delay allowed the body to kick-start its own
disease-fighting mechanisms even as the chemotherapy controlled the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not those particular findings hold up, the Dutch
doctor's strategy of trying new and creative uses of long-standing
cancer treatments is being replicated worldwide. The result: tens
of thousands of lives saved or prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the incremental improvements that matter,'' says Pinedo,
who runs the medical oncology program at the Free University in
Amsterdam and is considered one of Europe's foremost cancer
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that retooling conventional therapies never will garner
the attention of the would-be breakthroughs that seek to starve
tumor cells or fix cancer-spawning genes. But he also knows that
exciting laboratory advances aren't much help for cancer patients
like Arne Roodenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Roodenberg had an enormous tumor in her breast, one that she and
her doctors for months mistook for extra milk produced while she
was breast-feeding. By the time it was diagnosed nearly three years
ago and she went to see Pinedo, it had grown to more than three
inches across, large enough to set off alarms and get her enrolled
in his clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my first chemotherapy my tumor was 8 centimeters;
the next day it was 4. In one day. It was great,'' the 38-year-old
mother of three recalls. The treatment worked so well that
Roodenberg went on an extended regimen, followed by surgery and
radiation. ``And I've had no cancer for two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that we are happy that doctors know so much
about this. We are happy that many women can be better about breast
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Blazing new ground with radiation therapy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the incremental progress driving today's cancer
treatment more apparent and impressive than in radiation therapy.
And nowhere have radiologists had more success in pushing that
envelope than in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One successful treatment involves a proton accelerator, which
draws on the special properties of positively-charged nuclei of
hydrogen atoms to target radiation directly at the tumor. While
conventional X-rays go clear through a patient, losing energy along
the way, a proton device delivers a stream of particles directly to
the tumor. Once there, the radiation simply stops, which means
there is more energy hitting, and hopefully killing, the tumor, and
less damage to surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The therapy should take another big leap forward in December
when Massachusetts General Hospital opens its $46 million Northeast
Proton Therapy Center in what used to be the workout yard of the
Charles Street Jail. The facility, jointly funded by the hospital
and the National Cancer Institute, will pump out radiation at
higher energies, allowing it to reach deeper-seated tumors in the
lungs, abdomen, prostate, uterus, bladder, and rectum. And the beam
can be rotated to reach different parts of the patient; in the old
Harvard cyclotron, where proton treatment is now performed, the
beam is fixed and the patient must be rotated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to treat any site in the human body,'' says Dr.
Herman Suit, who directs Mass. General's Radiation Oncology
Department and pioneered many of the improvements in proton beam
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the same sorts of gains oncologists at Mass. General
are hoping for with another radiation technology being tried on
breast cancer patients. Hollow tubes about the size of an
intravenous line are inserted at half-inch intervals around the
tumor, then filled with seeds of radioactive iridium, eliminating
the need for less precise external beams and taking just five days,
compared to six weeks with standard radiation. ``So far all our
patients are fine, but we're still awaiting final proof in five or
10 years that it's effective,'' says Dr. Simon Powell, who oversees
the implant program.
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, meanwhile, cancer
specialists are trying out another radiation treatment on patients
with low-grade lymphomas. Researchers recently developed an
antibody that targets those tumors, and doctors now are attaching
to those antibodies a radioactive iodine solution they hope will
help kill cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find a biological attack point,'' explains Dr.
Lowell Schnipper, the medical center's chief of hematology and
oncology. ``It's the first in a series of strategies that will be
more tailored to the tumor itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That challenge of getting radiation where it can do the most
good has preoccupied radiologists ever since Wilhelm Conrad
Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895. The latest tack being tried is
delivering the radiation during surgery, rather than before or
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With certain spinal tumors, for instance, doctors use a
seemingly-endless series of CAT scans as a roadmap to delicately
plant catheters of cancer-fighting radioactive material in the
spine. The challenge with cancers in the rectum, pancreas, abdomen,
and pelvis is getting the radiation there without damaging the
bowel or other tissue that is in the way. The solution: During
surgery, after the visible tumor has been removed, the bowel,
bladder, and other critical organs are manually pushed aside so a
radioactive beam can zero in on whatever cancer cells remain.
</P>
<P>
   This ``intraoperative electron beam'' technique was inaugurated
in 1978, and now is widely used at Mass. General, the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, and other major hospitals, with dramatic
results: Recurrence rates of 45 percent for locally-advanced rectal
cancer have been lowered to 10 percent, and outcomes are equally
good for certain sarcomas of the abdomen and pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur S. Athanas is one of those remarkable statistics. Two
years ago, he had a tumor in his bile duct so difficult to reach
that three doctors told him ``they wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot
pole,'' the 78-year-old Athanas recalls. At Mass. General, however,
surgeons used a combination of conventional radiation, surgery, and
the intra-operative beam to destroy the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, says Athanas, there is no sign of any cancer and ``I
don't have to go in for another checkup for another year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Surgery best hope for many cancers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, when chemotherapy and radiation were in their
infancy, surgery was the best hope for most cancer patients. It
still is, at least when the cancer hasn't spread.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because solid tumors in the liver, lungs, and
other organs often are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, so
surgery often is the only option. It's also because surgeons have
refined their techniques, lowering the risks and raising the
precision with which they can excise cancerous cells. Most
promising is the way surgeons are collaborating with colleagues in
radiation and chemotherapy, using them to shrink tumors before an
operation and to kill remaining cancer cells afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation has been dramatic with surgery for cancers of
the rectum, as well as those of the head and neck, bones, and
cartilage. ``Fifteen years ago, if you got a sarcoma involving a
limb, it was sacrificed. Now, because of the ability to use
radiation and drugs after surgery, you can just resect it and spare
the limb,'' says Dr. Bruce Chabner, chief medical officer at
Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare and former head of treatment
programs at the NCI.

<P>
   As with other types of surgery, new methods are allowing
surgeons to do much less cutting to get at cancerous tumors. Using
laparoscopes, physicians can insert a slender tube into the body
through a keyhole incision and direct it to the site of a tumor. A
fiber-optic cable beams images onto a screen in the operating room
to guide the doctor, who cuts and sews using tiny instruments
inserted through other dime-sized slits.
</P>
<P>
   Newer refinements offer hope of even less traumatic surgery. For
example, radiofrequency ablation, a thermal technique for attacking
diseased tissue, is being tested on liver tumors at Mass. General.
A needle is inserted into the tumor, then connected to a device
that generates 500-kilohertz radio waves capable of coagulating and
ultimately destroying the cancer cells. Five years ago it wouldn't
work on lesions greater than half an inch; today it is being used
on tumors as big as two inches.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons aren't the only ones who have been fine-tuning their
techniques. Better ways of administering anesthesia, providing
intensive care, and boosting nutrition have meant fewer pre- and
postoperative complications. The bottom line, says cancer surgeon
Kenneth Tanabe of MGH, is that ``surgery is an option for many more
patients than it was before. This is especially true for
complicated procedures like cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, and
liver.''

<P>
   Chemotherapy, the third major weapon in the war against cancer,
also has been the subject of continuous experimentation and
refinement. And here more than anywhere, those refinements have
arisen as much from serendipity as from science.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened 37 years ago when Barnett Rosenberg, a
biophysicist at Michigan State University, made an unusal
observation: When an electric current generated by platinum
electrodes was run through a solution of E. coli bacteria, the
organisms continued to grow but stopped dividing. When the
electricity was shut off, the bacteria started to divide again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was the electricity, because the effects
followed precisely after we turned it on and off,'' recalls
Rosenberg, who now runs his own research institute in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out it was the platinum _ or, more specifically, a
chemical called cisplatin produced when platinum electrodes leached
into the solution _ that turned off the cell division. Rosenberg
suspected that if cell division could be arrested in bacteria, it
also could be arrested in cancer cells. So he tested cisplatin on
mice, then on humans with testicular cancer. In 1978 the FDA
approved its use.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been breathtaking. Before cisplatin, fewer than
10 percent of patients with testicular cancer survived for five
years; now, more than 90 percent of even advanced cases are cured.
And it can be effective in treating cancer of the lungs, ovaries,
and head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men were lying in bed dying of testicular cancer, and
women of ovarian. They gave them this new drug and they stood up
and walked out. You're dead and now you're alive,'' recalls Dr. Lee
Nadler, head of adult oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, says Dr. Harold Varmus, head of the National
Institutes of Health, is that ``pure serendipity is important. It
illustrates what is meant by incremental progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes progress means adding one old-standby drug to another
that has been around for years, creating the sorts of potent
``cocktails'' that have proven so effective in battling the AIDS
virus. Combinations of fluorouracil and levamisole gave oncologists
their first real success with cancers of the colon, while cisplatin
works even better when mixed with bleomycin and etoposide for
patients with tumors of the testicles.
</P>
<P>
   Other advances have come from altering the timing of treatments,
first moving the chemotherapy to just after the operation, then to
just before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of chemotherapy as conventional, as old hat,''
says Dr. Emil Frei, former physician-in-chief at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute and a front-line fighter against cancer for 43
years. ``But chemo continues to march as the most important
systematic approach to cancer cure and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   People also think of chemotherapy as bringing with it vomiting,
depletion of white blood cells, and other sickening side effects.
But many of those problems, too, are becoming more memory than
reality, as researchers over the last 10 years have developed
medicines to control nausea and pump up production of white and red
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   While hair loss still ``is absolutely as prevalent as ever,
we've tried to get rid of the most feared side effects,'' says Dr.
Douglas Faller, director of the Cancer Research Center at Boston
Medical Center. And while lessening side effects is a major relief
to patients, it also can give a big boost to their therapy. ``It
gives us greater ability to deliver these chemotherapy drugs
without interruption,'' explains Dr. Charles Fuchs of Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca McClintock of Francestown, N.H., who has twice had to
contend with cancer, says she is living proof of the difference
those refinements have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an absolute walk in the park,'' the 30-year-old says,
comparing recent chemo treatments for breast cancer with those she
received for leukemia as a teenager. ``When I think of chemotherapy
15 years ago, that's what I think of, throwing up. This time I was
in my second trimester of a pregnancy when I was having chemo. If I
had been sick it might have been difficult to tell whether it was
the chemo or pregnancy that was causing it. But I didn't get sick
once.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude has always been that chemo is better than nothing,
and now it's a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Doctor seek out better treatment formula
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinedo, the Dutch doctor, knows that patients are skeptical
about medicine's ability to make a difference with cancer,
especially when the disease has reached an advanced stage. That's
why, when he began treating patients with breast tumors as large as
six inches, Pinedo resolved to devise a better formula for mixing
and blending the latest techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of administering the three 21-day cycles of chemo before
surgery that is becoming the standard for large breast tumors, he
has tried four to six cycles. In this way, Pinedo hopes to shrink
the tumor enough to give surgeons a better shot at excising it all
while preserving more of the breast. And he gives his patients a
biological growth factor, known as GM-CSF, to protect the bone
marrow and, he hopes, to stimulate the body's own cancer-fighting
T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we observed in our group of 24 patients was that 76
percent are disease-free and surviving, versus about 50 percent if
you do three cycles of treatment,'' says Pinedo. ``And we never saw
one during chemo who had progression of the disease in the breast
or beyond, so we were not at all nervous about the longer
treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does longer treatment work so well? Pinedo isn't sure, which
is why he has begun more extensive trials in Mexico City, where
early detection is spotty and women often develop large breast
tumors before they are diagnosed. Over the next four years he hopes
to try the technique on at least 300 Mexican women.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis,'' explains Pinedo, ``is that if you can
preserve the lymph nodes longer you may help build up an immune
response to the primary tumor, which would help make the
chemotherapy work better.'' He also suspects that the tumor, along
with surrounding cells, might be producing anti-angiogenesis
factors that choke off the supply of blood to cancer cells that
have spread to other organs, ``which may be why with these big
tumors there's no manifest metastasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this proves to work in big tumors in the breast, it's
certainly worthwhile to try it on smaller tumors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pinedo isn't the only one who's intrigued by these
possibilities. Scientists from Boston to Houston are following his
work and collaborating in his follow-up studies. ``Most people
think of chemotherapy as being immunosuppressive, but these
findings suggest it is actually the opposite under certain
circumstances,'' says Dr. Gabriel Hortobagyi, chairman of breast
oncology at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more work to be done, but these preliminary
results certainly are of major interest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy has waged two wars
against cancer _ one political, the other personal.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped into the political crucible in 1971, when he and his
colleagues on the Senate health subcommittee pushed a bill to give
the National Cancer Institute enough money and power to make
conquering cancer ``a national crusade.'' They weren't worried
about opposition from the National Institutes of Health, which was
concerned that it would lose authority over the NCI. And they
weren't worried about resistance from the medical and science
establishments, which were concerned that more money wouldn't cure
cancer but might jeopardize funding for their other pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly that the president objected to the independence
Kennedy was proposing for the NCI. But even more, those involved
recall, Nixon couldn't stomach the idea of signing legislation
bearing the Kennedy name. Older brother Jack, after all, had beaten
Nixon in a run for the White House in 1960, Bobby had hoped to
oppose him in 1968, and Ted, despite denials that he was running,
was among the rivals Nixon most feared in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: The Kennedy-Javits bill was scuttled, and nearly
identical wording was inserted into the administration's
hastily-filed cancer bill, which carried the name of Republican
Senator Peter H. Dominick of Colorado and had originally envisioned
a decidedly different program. The prospect of a Democratic Senate
passing a Republican bill, especially one as important as the
cancer act, was nearly unprecedented, but in this case it also was
the only way to ensure the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kennedy pulled away, Nixon agreed to make the
announcement,'' recalls Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., a former NCI
chief. ``I saw Nixon later, and he told me this law was one of his
finest achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, meanwhile, looks back with some amusement at what must
have been a painful moment: ``I said, `It's fine with me to put
Peter Dominick's name on it.' I asked Peter, and he said `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, as the senator from Massachusetts joined
other legislators at a White House signing ceremony the morning of
Dec. 23, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   While he extended an olive branch in the morning, Nixon later
that afternoon plotted a dirty tricks campaign that would make it
appear that Kennedy was planning to challenge Democratic
frontrunner Edmund Muskie in the upcoming New Hampshire
presidential primary. That scheme, which surfaced in a tape
released last year, prompted Kennedy to signal again that he wasn't
a candidate and pushed the Democrats deeper into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years after he helped launch the war on cancer,
Kennedy found himself back on the front lines, in a painfully
personal way.
</P>
<P>
   His son Teddy Jr., just 12, had an ache in his right kneecap
that wouldn't go away. Doctors thought it was a calcium deposit,
and young Teddy preferred to ignore it, but eventually he went to
Georgetown Hospital for an X-ray, a biopsy _ and very bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me that I was going to lose part of my leg due to
cancer,'' Ted Jr. said in a recent interview. ``I thought he meant
the doctors would simply have to cut out the swollen part in my
kneecap, but he said, `not exactly. It's from the knee down.' I
thought my life was over. It's the typical thing when most people
hear those words, `You have cancer.' It's an unforgettable
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally unforgettable were the odds in 1973 that a child would
survive osteogenic sarcoma, a rare cancer in which the tumor
invades the cartilage along with the bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd amputate, and 80 percent of them would relapse in the
lungs. They lost life and limb,'' recalls Dr. Emil Frei, the former
physician-in-chief at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who was a
consultant on Teddy's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, doctors were beginning to experiment with a two-drug
combination of methotrexate and leucovorin. Methotraxate, an
antitumor drug, was given in doses 30 to 40 times higher than
normal to kill the cancer cells. Twenty-four hours later,
leucovorin was added to keep the methotrexate from killing the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jr. became just the fourth participant in a clinical trial
of the experimental regimen. Every three weeks he'd take the
Eastern shuttle back to Boston on Friday afternoon and spend the
weekend in the hospital, with the chemicals slowly dripping out of
a plastic bag into his body. The senator came, too, bringing movies
and games, friends and relatives, trying to keep his son amused
during the day, and spending nights in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The side effects from the chemotherapy at times seemed
unbearable. ``It was pretty bad,'' says Ted, the middle of the
senator's three children. ``There were mouth sores, and I couldn't
keep anything down because I had these open sores.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost most of his blonde hair, always felt tired, had to get
regular injections to temper the effects of other medicines, and
was trying to get comfortable with the prosthetic where his lower
leg used to be.
</P>
<P>
   But the experimental treatment was working. Two years of the
chemotherapy was killing whatever cancer remained in his body, to
the point where he can say today, ``I'm totally clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the outset, the new regimen doubled the cure rate
for osteogenic sarcoma, compared to amputation alone, from 20
percent to 40 percent. Other drugs were added to the mix later, and
doctors began giving the chemotherapy just before surgery, not
after, improvements that eventually achieved a success rate of 80
percent and saved the limbs of many patients. Now 36, Ted Jr. can
look back with some perspective on his ordeal, and on the phone
call he got 25 years ago from President Nixon wishing him a quick
recovery from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Today the senator's son avoids the spotlight, but he is
passionate about his practice of health and disability law in New
Haven. He speaks to groups of cancer patients and disability rights
advocates. He also skis, sails, and swims, and, with his wife, is
raising two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience has given me a profound appreciation of
everything in my life today,'' he says. ``There was a time when I
never thought I would be able to raise two young children. Not just
because of my own recovery, but because of the toxic effects my
chemo could have had on my ability to reproduce.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, meanwhile, thinks about Ted Jr. every time he's
asked to assess the success of the still-controversial war on
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has the $34 billion we've spent been worth it? I can speak as
a father,'' the senator begins, his voice softening. Without the
medical innovations supported by the war on cancer, the elder
Kennedy continues, his son ``never would have made it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: More Nazi files curiously disappear
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 9, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why did it not surprise me late last month to read that files
documenting gold stolen from Jews by the Nazis mysteriously
disappeared from German archives well after the conclusion of World
War II _ and that U.S. negligence played a role?
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times story suggested that the 26 secret files may
have disappeared to cover the tracks ``of former Nazi banking
officials entrusted by the Allies with high offices in postwar
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   It is but another example of how Nazi war criminals have been
able to escape accountability for their foul actions. The trail of
at-large Nazis reaches from Argentina to Syria to the United States
as well as in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one is flushed out, tried and deported, but there
will be no end to this issue as there have been too many coverups.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. involvement is long-documented, from Gen. George Patton's
coddling and use of Nazis in the immediate postwar to the flood of
suspected Nazi war criminals who entered the U.S., lying about
their past but exposed by others and still allowed to stay until
their lives were close to life-cycle completion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most notorious cases was that of Valerian Trifa, a
leader of Romania's pro-Nazi Iron Guard who was responsible for the
deaths of thousands of Jews as well as an attempt to overthrow the
Romanian government.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Valerian Trifa and his Romanian-born New York City
tormenter, a Jewish dentist names Charles Kremer, is documented in
a remarkable book by Howard Blum. Called ``Wanted: The Search for
Nazis in America,'' it exposes U.S. negligence in pursuing persons
such as Trifa, even after mounds of documents were presented by an
obsessed Kremer detailing Trifa's diabolic activities in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1941Trifa was tried in absentia by the Romanian
government, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. By then,
however, he was spirited out of Romania by the Nazis and under
their protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he avoided authorities and, in 1950, arrived in
New York. He lied about his past and was admitted. And what did
Trifa do while he was in the U.S.? He become head of the
Michigan-based Romanian Orthodox Church; Bishop Trifa, if you
please.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's the most astonishing thing about Trifa's U.S.
presence. On May 11, 1955, Bishop Trifa gave the opening prayer at
the U.S. Senate. It had been requested by the president of the
Senate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It never has been answered to my satisfaction why Nixon asked
for Trifa, or if Nixon even knew of Trifa's past. Blum's book
speculates on much of it, not in favor of Nixon, but I won't go
into it here.
</P>
<P>
   By 1957, and despite a U.S. law that anyone belonging to the
Iron Guard before 1952 will be denied citizenship, Bishop Trifa
became a U.S. citizen. Understand that Kremer had been writing U.S.
officials about Trifa since 1941!
</P>
<P>
   The Trifa case is but one; there are dozens of similar episodes
of known Nazis getting into the U.S. Look how long it took for the
issue of Nazi gold and Swiss, Portuguese and U.S. complicity to
surface. And now some of the secret files are announced as missing.
</P>
<P>
   The article said the files were shipped to the U.S. after being
found by U.S. troops in Germany in 1945. Now, they're nowhere to be
found, not even microfilm copies.
</P>
<P>
   The long, wicked arm of ODESSA, that secretive Nazi SS
protective organization, still is being felt.

GOING AFTER CANCER'S ACHILLES' HEEL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  They were hailed as biological ``guided missiles'' when they
were developed in the 1970s, but monoclonal antibodies fell short
of their targets in early tests against cancer and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable turnaround, however, these biotech weapons are
now leading the charge in the early testing of new, highly specific
drugs that aim for the genetic Achilles' heels of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, one monoclonal antibody drug has been approved to treat
an immune cancer, lymphoma, with fewer side effects than standard
chemo agents. Another, Herceptin, is on a Food and Drug
Administration ``fast track'' toward approval after showing
encouraging results against metastatic breast cancer in cases where
other therapies had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Slamon, a University of California at Los Angeles
scientist whose research led to the development of Herceptin, was
in the spotlight at a major cancer meeting this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time when molecular biology has really paid
off,'' he declared, ``where we've identified a genetic alteration,
showed its role in a disease process, and then targeted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and binds to
a molecule found on the surface of about 30 percent of breast
cancer cells. The molecule, known as the HER-2/neu receptor, acts
as an on-off switch. When on, it makes breast cancer especially
aggressive and fast-moving. Herceptin keeps the switch turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the HER-2/neu protein isn't present on normal breast
cells, Herceptin selectively attacks the cancer. Results announced
in May showed that the drug, combined with the best standard
chemotherapy agent, caused tumors to shrink by half or more in 49
percent of women, compared with 32 percent of those on the chemo
alone.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, 28 percent of women on Herceptin had no evidence
of tumor progression, compared with 14 percent in the chemo-only
group.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're expensive and must be given by injection,
monoclonals may not be the ultimate cancer drugs, but they're
further along in development than most of the ``small molecule''
drugs that eventually may be more selective and easier to
administer.
</P>
<P>
   Antibodies are the proteins made by the body's immune system
cells to recognize and attack specific foreign invaders, such as
infectious germs. The body makes millions of antibodies, each of
which has a specific shape to recognize and bind to a foreign
molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, scientists discovered how to make large
quantities of identical antibodies _ hence ``monoclonal'' _ in
mice. There were high hopes that these would be ``magic bullets''
that could be tailored to identify and latch onto unique structures
on cancer cells. The antibodies could then be loaded with toxins or
radioactive substances that would destroy the cells.
</P>
<P>
   Antibodies can be used against cancer in three ways, says Dr.
Mark Kaminski, a researcher at the University of Michigan School of
Medicine:
</P>
<P>
   _They can bind to cancer cells and alert the immune system to
attack them.
</P>
<P>
   _They can latch onto cells and trigger a signal within each one
that halts its growth or causes it to commit suicide. Or they can
block growth signals from outside the cell and squelch growth that
way.
</P>
<P>
   _They can serve as guided missiles, homing in on cancer cells
after scientists attach a molecular warhead, in the form of toxins
or drugs, that kills targeted cells.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disappointing start for antibody approach
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, antibody treatments were deeply disappointing
for the first 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the hot technology in the late '80s,'' says Donald
Drakeman, president of Medarex, Inc., in New Jersey. ``It was an
exciting opportunity, and like with all brand-new technologies, no
one figured out the problems. By the early '90s antibodies became
almost a dirty word.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem was that patients' immune systems recognized
the proteins from the mice used to make the monoclonals as foreign
and attacked them. &UR;  &LR; The drugs were destroyed before they could
reach their targets.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers learned to ``humanize'' the antibodies by
replacing most of the mouse components with human ones, their
effectiveness rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 years we learned more about how to use them
and which (molecules) are especially good targets,'' says Drakeman.
</P>
<P>
   And now the new drug Herceptin, made by Genentech, Inc., of
South San Francisco, has put monoclonal antibodies back in the
spotlight with its ability to fight breast cancer. Genentech says
it expects FDA approval by the fall and it will be able to supply
what is expected to be a large market. (Some clinical trials of
Herceptin are still open for women who meet the criteria.)
</P>
<P>
   Edith Sooy is a Massachusetts woman who took Herceptin in the
company's earlier trials and believes she is alive today because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sooy, 54, of Dover, was treated for breast cancer in 1987, but
discovered in 1992 that it had spread to her lungs. The most potent
standard drugs, like adriamycin and the relatively new agent,
Taxol, failed to help. ``They're dreadful drugs'' because of their
side effects, she says, ``and when they don't do anything for you,
it's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because her tumor was among the 30 percent that carry the
HER-2/neu genes, Sooy was able to enroll in a Herceptin study at
Boston University Medical Center. In early 1996 she began taking
the intravenous agent. Within a few months, her tumors had shrunk
by 50 percent of more, and the toxicity was very mild. ``It's
heaven _ if it keeps your cancer in check,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the tumors grew back. Since then, she has been on
a series of combinations of chemo drugs and Herceptin. Her disease
has progressed, but slowly. ``I think I'm very lucky to be alive
and well and doing my gardening. I have to think it has to be due
in part to the Herceptin,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Other monoclonal antibodies have shown effectiveness against
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an immune-system cancer. In addition to the
already approved Rituxan, an experimental monoclonal antibody
called Bexxar is undergoing testing at the University of Michigan,
where Kaminski has reported a series of promising test results. All
of the newly diagnosed patients with advanced low-grade
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have responded to the drug, and 17 of 24
patients followed for at least six months have had a complete
remission, Kaminski reported.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is now in progress to see whether patients who relapsed
after the first round of treatment will respond to a second dose of
Bexxar. Thus far, says Kaminski, ``we've gotten the majority of
patients back into remission.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a huge selling point for patients who have volunteered
for trials. ``What you go through in this treatment is so much less
(traumatic) than chemotherapy, so if you had to do it again, it
wouldn't take as much out of you,'' says Teresa Singh, 39, who
chose treatment with Bexxar after being diagnosed in 1996 with
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   She was told that with conventional chemotherapy she might be
put into remission _ free of disease as far as standard tests show
_ but that she would likely relapse. One expert told her she might
live 6 to 9 years after diagnosis; another put it at 10 to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have (plans for) a lot longer than that to live,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bexxar seeks out a target protein, called cd20, on the surface
of the affected blood cells. To the antibody is attached
radioactive iodine, which at close range can kill those cells.
</P>
<P>
   Singh received the treatment in a special hospital room in which
she was shielded by lead slabs and had to take precautions to avoid
contaminating others. ``I had to flush the toilet three times'' to
ensure that contaminated urine was completely disposed of, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and other patients have been astonished to find their
swollen lymph glands and other sites of cancer shrink quickly _
sometimes within a week or two _ after the radioactive assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think oncologists don't raise their hopes too easily,'' says
Singh, ``and Dr. Kaminski is still very conservative in the way he
talks about this. I can't say I never worry about it coming back,
but I'm thankful I have this treatment that isn't grueling... and
there is hope for a cure.''

   Cancer patients typically rely on their doctors to tell them
about new and experimental treatments, but physicians may not know
about everything that's out there. &UR;  &LR; And many consumers want to find
out for themselves what investigational therapies are available.
</P>
<P>
   For patients like this, the National Cancer Institute recently
launched an Internet site providing access to a database of all
clinical trials of cancer treatments. With a computer and modem,
anyone can read informative articles about clinical trials and how
to decide whether to volunteer for them. And users can search the
database to find a trial involving a particular type of cancer or a
certain drug.
</P>
<P>
   At present, only 1 to 3 percent of all cancer patients
participate in clinical trials. Mary McCabe of the NCI's office of
clinical research promotion says this is due in large part to a
lack of publicity, and the institute hopes the Internet site will
help change this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope is that a consideration of being in a clinical
trial will become part of good cancer care,'' says McCabe. The NCI
has also been talking with various health care plans in hopes of
persuading more of them to cover the costs of investigational
treatments, which many now exclude.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI site's Internet address is
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov
</P>
<P>
   For consumers without access to a computer, the information is
available in paper format. Call the NCI public hotline:

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Inside Jim Hassmann's bones, out-of-control white
blood cells had taken over. Dividing unchecked, they were squeezing
out the marrow that produces life-sustaining red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional drugs failed to slow his rampaging chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. ``The hematologist said there was
nothing else to help me, that I was at end-stage,'' recalls
Hassmann, 54, who was breathless, tired , and sick. ``And I was
making end-stage plans.''
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, the Houston man was referred earlier this year
to the vast M.D. Anderson Cancer Center here, where besides
standard treatment, patients can volunteer for a wide range of
experimental therapies, from cancer vaccines to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The first two drugs he tried failed. But in April, Hassmann was
switched to a drug called Campath-1H, made by a Cambridge, Mass.,
biotech company, LeukoSite. The drug worked like a ``smart bomb''
to knock out the cancer cells while sparing the marrow that makes
new normal white cells. And unlike most standard chemotherapies, it
didn't cause dangerous, toxic side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling better within a week,'' says Hassmann,
astonished and grateful after a course of 12 weekly treatments. ``I
came there with no hope. Now this could be good for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   How long Hassman's new lease on life will continue is unknown.
Like dozens of other novel anticancer agents that have prompted a
surge of optimism in the field, Campath-1H is still in early
testing.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that in 1998, there is marked
optimism about this new generation of ``targeted'' therapies aimed
at controlling cancer with vastly more precise and less toxic drugs
than those now available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pushed (conventional) chemotherapy about as far as it
can go,'' says Dr. John Mendelsohn, a molecular biologist and
president of M.D. Anderson. ``It's possible we'll be able to
discover new chemotherapy agents, but we think the targeting of
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes'' that malfunction in cancer
cells ``is another major attack we can make'' on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer center, one of the nation's two largest (the other is
Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York), houses 800 faculty
scientists and treats 65,000 patients a year. There are 494
clinical trials in progress here, including a broad sampling of the
novel cancer therapies that have moved into the spotlight in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Patients come to Houston from all over, many of them staying in
high-rise hotels that loom over the enormous Texas Medical Center
in which M.D. Anderson is located. In various clinics, they sit
waiting for treatments, undergoing infusions of drugs through
intravenous lines, or nervously anticipating lab results.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Hassmann, are receiving drugs based on monoclonal
antibodies _ engineered proteins that recognize and latch onto
specific cancer cells. Other drugs are designed to block cancerous
growth signals from reaching the receivers on the surface of cells
or inside them _ like filling a keyhole with gum so the key won't
fit, as one researcher put it.
</P>
<P>
   Others have volunteered for tests of angiogenesis inhibitors.
These drugs disrupt the network of tiny blood vessels a tumor needs
to grow, thus halting or shrinking the tumor. In early human
testing these inhibitors have produced mixed results, but the most
powerful ones are not yet ready for patient trials.
</P>
<P>
   Still other patients, including some with lung, head, and neck
cancers, are undergoing gene therapy. Dr. Jack Roth, chairman of
thoracic surgery at M.D. Anderson, is leading trials in which a
gene that is often defective in cancer cells, called p53, is being
ferried into tumor cells by means of a virus, in hopes of halting
malignant growth.
</P>
<P>
   It is p53's job to detect cells with damaged DNA, and either
keep them from dividing until they are repaired, or nudge them
along a path to programmed self-destruction before they can do
harm. Mutant p53 genes, by contrast, allow damaged cells to keep on
reproducing, which can lead to cancer as the cells accumulate
genetic damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you restore p53 function'' with gene therapy, ``it could
trigger this cell death'' and turn off cancerous growth, Roth says.
The therapy appears safe and has shown some activity against tumors
in early tests, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Strategy takes aim at broken cells
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy aims not to repair cells with broken p53s, but
to wipe them out. A bioengineered virus called ONYX-015
specifically attacks and kills cells with mutant p53 genes.
Scientists reported this spring that in combination with two
standard chemotherapy drugs, the virus has shrunk tumors of the
head and neck in 9 out of 10 patients in early trials.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines _ the name for a strategy of revving up the
immune system to attack cancer cells _ are also being tested here
and at a number of academic centers and biotech companies. Efforts
to harness the immune system to fight cancer has had a long history
and few real triumphs, but scientists now know more about how the
complex immune defenses work and are more optimistic that selective
and powerful vaccines can be made.
</P>
<P>
   One vaccine that mobilizes the immune system against deadly
melanoma is heading toward possible approval in Europe and Canada
by the end of the year and perhaps next year in the United States.
Called Melacine, it has been tested in patients with advanced
melanoma who have dismal prognoses. It has proven to be as
effective in extending survival by a few months as is the standard
four-drug chemotherapy treatment. But Melacine is much less
punishing in its side effects, say officials of RIBI ImmunoChem
Research, Inc., the vaccine's makers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the broadly toxic chemotherapies in use today,
the new agents have been precisely designed to attack, or in some
cases, correct, specific genetic changes that turn normal cells
into malignant ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, we have cured a series of cancers that affect young
people,'' says Dr. Donald Coffey, of the Johns Hopkins Cancer
Center, referring to diseases like leukemia and Hodgkin's disease
in which the war on cancer has had its greatest triumphs to date.
``We did this with drugs that blocked DNA synthesis'' _ meaning
they killed tumor cells, but often hammered normal cells as well,
causing terrible side effects.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that people were so terrified by the
disease that they wouldn't even utter its name.
</P>
<P>
   So they called it the ``Big C.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, cancer, which has resisted nearly every weapon
medicine has deployed against it since the ``war on cancer'' was
launched 27 years ago, is finally showing signs of vulnerability.
There's no miracle cure, and there may never be. But scientists and
doctors have come to know the enemy, intimately. They now know how
cancer starts, what it takes for tumors to grow, and even how
cancer cells sometimes commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   And they are using that knowledge to battle back in what
longtime cancer-fighters say is the most promising push ever
against the illness, a campaign being waged on numerous fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very optimistic,'' says Dr. Richard Klausner, who as
director of the National Cancer Institute is leading the charge.
``I am, as a scientist, continuously amazed at how much we know now
that we didn't know a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clear to anyone looking at it is that the number of
ideas and strength of those ideas has gone up remarkably. That's
real progress. That's the type of progress we have to make if we're
going to get, ultimately, to our goal of curing cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That progress is most evident in the laboratories of molecular
biologists who devote their lives to unraveling the intricate
machinery within microscopic living cells. Some are learning how to
turn off genetic growth switches that get stuck in the ``on''
position, and to replace tumor-suppressing genes that break and
allow cells to spin out of control. Others, relying on newfound
understanding of the immune system, are developing ways to marshal
the body's own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   And at Children's Hospital in Boston, Dr. Judah Folkman and his
colleagues have proven they can shrink tumors in mice by choking
off the tumors' blood supply. While recent media accounts raised
unrealistic hopes about how fast that strategy might be translated
into treatment for humans, researchers still say this is the most
hopeful weapon on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Emma Carey of Exeter, N.H., stands as living proof
of how such sophisticated knowledge of what goes on inside cancer
cells already is yielding important real-world applications _ and
of how much more it might yield in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When Emma was diagnosed with leukemia last year, doctors at
Massachusetts General Hospital used a new ``molecular diagnostics''
test to spot telltale genetic alterations in her blood cells. With
that genetic profile, ``we could tell her parents that she has an
excellent chance of survival, close to 90 percent,'' says her
physician, Dr. Howard Weinstein. Before long, Weinstein adds, such
genetic profiles may be used to tailor highly specific treatment
recipes to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Even while they are awaiting new payoffs from the laboratory,
cancer doctors are hard at work getting old tools to perform new
functions. &UR;  &LR; That means concocting promising cocktails of old and
new chemotherapy drugs, targeting radiation to tumors in ways that
make it more precise and potent, and fine-tuning surgical
techniques _ all of which are extending and saving the lives of
patients today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war on cancer has worked,'' says Dr. Vincent T. DeVita
Jr., the former NCI chief who helped launch that effort in 1971 and
led it until 1988. ``My projection is that the reduction in
mortality and incidence rates will deepen every year. We'll hit a
30-percent reduction for breast cancer alone by the year 2000, and
overall rates will be down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll do away with cancer,'' adds DeVita, who
now runs the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven. ``But it won't be the
major killer it once was. It will be controllable so people can
live with it, like they do with diabetes, and we'll be preventing a
lot of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disease has long been one of humanity's scourges
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand how far we've come, and how much remains to be
done, it is critical to understand the history of the long struggle
against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has always been one of humanity's scourges, but the
stakes were raised in the 1950s and '60s as more and more people
began dying of cancer. Part of that was attributable to the longer
average lifespan of most Americans, since cancer is primarily a
disease of aging. More sedentary lifestyles and increasingly fatty
diets probably contributed as well. Most of all, however, smoking
caught on widely among men during World War I. Women joined in not
long after. A generation later the toll began to surface in the
form of soaring rates of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As cancer rates rose, doctors fought back, but with few weapons.
Researchers worked to add to the arsenal, but their approach was
hit-or-miss, relying more on happy accidents than on scientific
acumen.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened near the end of World War II, when an
Allied ship loaded with sulfur mustard, a poisonous gas the Germans
had used during World War I, blew up in Italy's Bari &UR;  &LR; Harbor.
Doctors treating the injured soldiers noticed that the gas had
curious effects on key components of the immune system _ white
blood cells were sharply depleted, lymphocytes were impaired, and
blood-forming bone marrow was damaged. That made them wonder: If
the gas impeded the normal workings of those cells, could it also
curb the much-feared lymphomas and leukemias in those tissues
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in New York, and other cancer centers ran experiments,
using a related gas called nitrogen mustard. The results, which
were kept secret until the end of the war, confirmed that cancers
did in fact regress when exposed to the gas, and patients got
better.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that medicine for the first time had an agent
able to shrink tumors, a discovery that seemed especially sweet
since it had been derived from an insidious poison. Soon,
researchers were using what they knew about mustard gas to concoct
other anticancer drugs.

 UNDATED: ... anticancer drugs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news was that the tumors didn't stay down for long,
generally didn't respond to a second round of treatment, and the
scientists didn't know what to do when the ``cure'' fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in 1955 there were relatively few anticancer
compounds that were active, relatively few patients that would
benefit from such treatments, and relatively few scientific leads
we could address and develop and apply,'' recalls Dr. Emil Frei,
now 74 and physician-in-chief emeritus at Boston's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early '60s, when Dr. George Canellos joined the
National Institutes of Health, things had begun to turn around.
``There was a spirit of discovery,'' says Canellos, now at
Dana-Farber. ``It opened my mind to the idea that drugs, medicine,
could be used to successfully treat cancer, where up to that time
there was only surgery.... To resurrect people you thought were
destined to die, you have no idea the feeling that gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   All America seemed to share the feeling that cancer was beatable
when, on Dec. 23, 1971, President Nixon signed the National Cancer
Act and launched a war on cancer he said should yield a cure within
five years. To a country that had managed to put a man on the moon
two years earlier, anything seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs were encouraging, at least in terms of sheer
activity. In the five years after the act was signed, Congress
appropriated more money for cancer than over the previous 33 years.
Cancer centers were funded across the country, and many of the
country's best scientists were drawn to the field. And there were
advances, big ones: &UR;  &LR; researchers developed powerful techniques for
hunting down and isolating genes; physicians pioneered ways to save
the limbs of young patients with bone cancer; and the US Food and
Drug Administration approved early anticancer drugs like
doxorubicin and cisplatin.
</P>
<P>
   But on the cancer wards, progress in beating back the deadly
disease wasn't happening as quickly as the public, and many
doctors, had envisioned. Some of the disappointment came from
chasing false leads. In the late 1960s and early '70s, many
scientists were drawn to the idea that viruses caused most cancers.
In the early 1980s, they hailed the protein interferon as a cure
for everything from cancer to the common cold, which proved too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamental, and more disturbing, was the growing
realization that cancer cells had an uncanny ability to resist
almost every drug thrown at them; some even found ways to spit out
toxic chemotherapies as fast as they were applied, eventually
resulting in the death of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the insight that cancer was not a single disease, but
``at least 100 different entities,'' as Dr. Donnall Thomas, Nobel
laureate and Seattle-based bone marrow transplant pioneer, puts it.
Making progress on one form, such as leukemia, often didn't help
with cancer of the lung, bladder, and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   At the discouraging bottom line were the numbers. Cancer deaths
rose an average of 0.4 percent per year between 1973 and 1990, and
the number of new cases climbed by 1.2 percent a year. Especially
frustrating were increases in lung, breast, and prostate cancer and
the rising death toll from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanomas.
This, doctors and patients agreed, wasn't what was supposed to
happen when America declared war on a disease.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it looked like a medical Vietnam. Critics suggested we
were losing the war and needed to radically rethink our strategy,
focusing more on prevention and boosting the budget for alternative
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of what is now 40 years of focus on treatment have
been seriously disappointing,'' says Dr. John Bailar. Bailar, a
biostatistician who chairs the Department of Health Studies at the
University of Chicago, is a longtime critic of the cancer
establishment, and remains unimpressed even with the recent
downturn in cancer deaths and incidence. The NCI and its sister
agencies haven't achieved as much as they should have for the money
spent, he says, and a lot of what they have achieved has come
through prevention, not treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the '70s, most cancer doctors believed they were
making progress. While critics suggested that position was designed
to perpetuate the unprecedented flow of tax dollars for research,
in retrospect their arguments were compelling. Scientists were
learning how the cancer cell differs from normal cells, an
understanding that often was advanced as much through their
failures as their successes. And despite the rising overall cancer
toll, progress was being made with cancer of the bladder, uterus,
and ovary; the seemingly relentless increases in rates of other
important cancers would finally reverse in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, personally, that the war on cancer was one of the
greatest experiments the US government ever did,'' says DeVita, the
former NCI chief. ``The information we have today on molecular
biology, on developmental biology, all those things came out of the
cancer program.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the researchers were not narrowly focused on
curing cancer. The knowledge fueling today's new cancer therapies
``is a brilliant vindication of curiosity-driven research,'' says
Robert Weinberg, a leading cancer scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge.
The keys, he adds, were that basic science took precedence over
immediate bedside applications, and funding came not just from the
NCI but from a variety of public and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In 1976, `the pieces finally came together'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although cancer is an ancient disease, researchers didn't
discover its root causes until two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans remember 1976 for its celebration of the nation's
bicentennial. But to cancer scientists, it was a watershed year
because, after decades of false starts and wrong turns in seeking
to unmask the origins of cancer, things suddenly went right.
</P>
<P>
   As Weinberg put it in a recent book, ``In one stroke, everything
fell into place. The pieces finally came together.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in the San Francisco laboratory of two
scientists, Harold Varmus, now the director of the National
Institutes of Health, and Dr. J. Michael Bishop, now chancellor of
the University of California in San Francisco. They showed that
cancer arises in human cells when certain normal genes _ later
shown to be controllers of cell growth and division _ are damaged
and metamorphose into cancer-causing ``oncogenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, an articulate scientist with a love of English and
metaphor, and Varmus, an Amherst College grad and
physician-turned-researcher, had teamed up in the '70s to study a
virus that causes cancer in chickens. That virus, it turned out,
does its dirty work by carrying a cancer-causing gene into chicken
cells: The gene triggers the cell's move to malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stunning insight was yet to come. In 1974, a
researcher in the Bishop-Varmus lab found that normal chicken cells
already contained a copy of that cancer-causing gene, but in a
slightly different, harmless form. The virus had only borrowed _ or
stolen _ it. And not only that: Further experiments showed that
most animals, including humans, have carried this Jekyll-and-Hyde
gene, which can become a cancer-causing oncogene, for eons.

letter had been regurgitated by one of the resident, Frisbee-size
spiders that make mail retrieval such an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no guarantee that a letter from our son
would calm our fears for his safety and assure us that he is having
a good time, flossing regularly and refraining from stepping on the
face of the kid in the lower bunk. Indeed, some letters home _ a
few of which were published recently in USA Today _ create more
anxiety than they alleviate.
</P>
<P>
   Take this one from Rebecca L. Baum, 14, of Loveland, Ohio:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mom, Dad, Ry, and Pip:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey guys! What's up? I miss all of you soooooooo much! I was
going to send you guys another letter today, but I decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp is totally awesome! It has been so dang hot down here
it's not even funny! Well, you know how I am the sweating queen? I
have the worst heat rash ever! The health center told me that I had
one of the worst cases they have seen the whole session!
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love it here! I was really sick yesterday. I
could barely get out of my bed! Annie thought I was dehydrated. I
probably was! I love you and miss you all but I best be goin' to
arts and crafts or the person will probably put the smack down on
me!''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Carrie Ince, 14, of San Antonio probably wish
they had let the postal spiders devour this letter home:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mom and Dad:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go home. I've had bad luck ever since I got here. So
far I stayed up to at least 3:00 p.m.-3:47 p.m. every night because
I'm sick. I got a splinter that was so deep they cut my pinkie to
get it out. I have no friends 'cause I'm in the younger cabin so
the older kids think I'm immature and the younger ones think I'm
too mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a food fight yesterday and a chicken thigh knocked the
wind out of me and a roll was thrown at my head. The girl on the
top bunk steps on my bed with mud on her shoes and when I'm at an
activity she throws her swimming supplies on my bed so I sleep with
a wet and muddy bed. She also steps on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, there are scorpions in our cabin. I'm always hot. To
tell you the truth, I hate the food here. It's gross. I haven't
eaten much. Also, a lot of girls in the cabin swear. It really
bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the girls have candy here but none will share. The
bathrooms are disgusting and my top part of my toothbrush (the part
that I brush me teeth with) fell down the drain and we can't get it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was inner-tubing in the river a thing stabbed me right
next to my eye and it's all scraped up. I'm getting sicker and
sicker. I don't think I'll last much longer. If you really love me,
you'll pick me up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love, Carrie
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. _ I drink tons of water.''

Twenty years after her breakthrough role in ``Halloween,'' she's
returned to her scream-queen roots in ``Halloween H2O.'' Herewith,

   VIDEO-DVD _ Slowly but surely, the phenomenon known as DVD is

Currently, DVD movies can be found in Atlanta at most high-tech
electronics stores and, on a limited basis, at selected Blockbuster
stores. Players cost between $500 and $1,500; most discs sell for

McCaysville (population 1,062) shares a downtown with Copperhill,
Tenn. (501). And they share the blue line, rich in irony. (May,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED. EMBARGOED UNTIL 8/9.

   FLORIDA-DROPOUTS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ To see a play at the
Kravis Center or to take soil samples from the Lake Worth Lagoon,
high school students need a permission slip signed by mom, dad or a
legal stand-in. But to drop out of school? No signature required.
Until now. Starting this fall, a Florida student can't drop out of
school _ even at age 16 _ until a parent or guardian signs off on
the decision. (Desmon, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FIRE-GEL _ PALM HARBOR, Fla. _ Fire gel remained relatively
unknown outside firefighting circles until John Bartlett and
business partner Bruce Hill, also a Palm Beach County firefighter,
used it on 20 homes in Flagler County during the recent wildfires
there. They coated the homes and retreated. When the fires passed

   SHIPWRECK _ AUSTIN _ A centuries-old shipwreck whose discovery
last February off the Texas coast excited historians is not the
long-lost flagship of French explorer La Salle as initially

Georgia has joined forces with local doctors to pay for an
operation to untie her reproductive tubes in an effort to allow her

   BABY-BANDS _ Hospitals admit it's almost impossible to prevent

possible. (Hill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   HORMONE _ For the first time, researchers have shown that
estrogen, the female hormone that is believed to protect against
heart attacks, also may protect against stroke. The study was done
in mice, but supports theories that giving a dose of estrogen after
a stroke might be a good idea for male and female patients. In the
study, rats took estrogen before researchers cut off blood flow to
their brains; those on estrogen had about half the brain damage as
those who took a placebo. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

CAPTAIN AHAB VS. THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (New York Times OpEd for release Mon., Aug. 4)  
 By ARTHUR SCHLESINGER JR.  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarter century ago I wrote ``The Imperial Presidency,'' which
argued that the American Constitution envisages a strong presidency
within an equally strong system of accountability. When the
constitutional balance is upset in favor of presidential power and
at the expense of presidential accountability, the office can be
said to become imperial.
</P>
<P>
   This exaltation of the presidency, as James Madison presciently
observed two centuries ago, is most likely to be justified by
``provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.'' The
more acute the international crisis, the more power flows to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The half century of protracted crisis from Pearl Harbor to the
breakup of the Soviet Union came close to institutionalizing the
imperial presidency. ``When the president does it,'' as Richard
Nixon told David Frost in a television interview about his
Watergate crimes, ``that means that it is not illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon carried this doctrine a little far. The result was
resignation to escape impeachment. A reaction against the imperial
presidency set in. In 1978 Congress passed the Independent Counsel
Act, a statute so loosely drawn as to enable special prosecutors to
conduct dragnet investigations with no limit on time or budget and
no formal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of the Soviet Union completed the revolt against the
abuse of presidential power. The imperial presidency collapsed once
that international crisis came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we see a presidency harried and enfeebled by an obsessed
special prosecutor. Kenneth Starr's original charge was to look
into a shady land deal 15 years ago in Arkansas. This turned out to
be a dry well, at least as far as President Clinton was involved.
Then Starr, through some form of sleight-of-hand intelligible only
to lawyers, managed to transform the Whitewater inquiry into an
investigation of the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   In the process he has succeeded in eliminating protections of
presidential privacy heretofore unchallenged. Over the protests of
the director of the Secret Service and even of Clinton's
predecessor, George Bush, Starr has obtained a court ruling
compelling Secret Service personnel to testify before his grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   As well as protecting presidents, Secret Service personnel must
now serve as spies for the special prosecutor. Starr has also
obtained a ruling that government lawyers cannot invoke the
attorney-client privilege in a criminal inquiry, thereby compelling
the deputy White House counsel to testify about his confidential
talks with Clinton. It is now difficult to see with whom the
president can discuss private matters _ save for his wife, who
cannot be compelled to testify against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wounds are to a considerable degree self-inflicted. If
he did what he is accused of, he should not have done it. But it is
demeaning for Americans and seems idiotic and stupefying to the
rest of the world that a crisis of the American presidency should
turn on the definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, judging by the most recent polls, still think
that even if what a president does in his private life is
deplorable, it is his own business. When they elected Clinton in
1992 and re-elected him in 1996, they did not think they were
sending a choirboy to the White House. They see him as a bright and
effective president who has been doing a pretty good job in his
official duties. ``If Hillary doesn't care,'' proclaimed a sign in
a crowd greeting Clinton, ``neither do we.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is not being truthful, his deceptions have to do with
his sex life. Catholics draw a distinction between ``venial'' _
that is, forgivable _ sins and ``mortal'' _ unforgivable _ sins.
Many Americans regard the denial of a sexual affair as a venial
sin. Most people have lied about their sex lives at one time or
another. You lie to protect yourself, your spouse, your lover, your
children.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen always lie about their sex lives. Only a cad will tell
the truth about his sexual affairs. Many people seem to feel that
questions no one has a right to ask do not call for truthful
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The indignation some Republicans have shown over alleged
presidential sexual waywardness would be more impressive if they
had shown retrospective indignation about President Harding's
sexual adventurism, so fascinatingly documented in Carl Sferrazza
Anthony's new biography of Florence Harding _ or if they had shown
equal indignation about President Ronald Reagan's statements during
the Iran-contra imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 6, 1986, Reagan said that the story about trading arms
for hostages ``has no foundation.'' A week later he called the
story ``utterly false,'' and added, ``We did not _ repeat _ did not
trade weapons or anything else for hostages.'' Reagan's falsehoods
had to do with his official duties, not with his private life, and
were a gross dereliction of his executive responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Nixon and the Watergate scandal, which
involved presidential sanction of burglary, wiretapping, political
dirty tricks, forgery, hush money, perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's pretext for the prurient invasion of presidential
privacy is the possibility of nailing Clinton for perjury, witness
tampering and obstruction of justice. Presumably his goal is to
prepare the way for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the last thing Republicans would wish is to replace
Clinton with the fresh, honest face of Albert Gore, who would then
have a head start on the presidency. They much prefer to spend the
rest of the term dealing with a weakened and discredited President
Clinton. They would probably find it much easier to beat Vice
President Gore in 2000 as the defender and heir of a disgraced
administration than to beat a President Gore armed with two years
of experience in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may also try to do what Henry Clay succeeded in
doing in the Senate in March 1834 _ that is, to pass a resolution
of censure of President Andrew Jackson. It was expunged three years
later when the Democrats regained control of the Senate. No
president has ever been thus censured since.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for all his own waywardness, has been sublimely lucky
in the enemies he has made _ Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Tom DeLay,
Trent Lott and, above all, Starr. One would some day like to see a
detailed and specific accounting of how Starr has managed to spend
$40 million or so of the taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   His pursuit of Clinton has rightly been compared to Captain
Ahab's monomaniacal ``quenchless feud'' with the White Whale. ``All
that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of
things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and
cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all
evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically
assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the
sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst
his hot heart's shell upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab vs. the American presidency: If Starr's quenchless
feud continues, he may well do permanent damage to the American
system of government. Enough is enough.

ZHIVKOV, COMMUNIST LEADER OF BULGARIA FOR 35 YEARS, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, an 800 word version of the obit will move as
OBIT-SHIVKOV-SHORT)  
(gm) 
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todor Zhivkov, the Communist ruler of Bulgaria from 1954 until
his ouster in 1989, died Wednesday night at a hospital in the
capital, Sofia. He was 86. Doctors said he died of complications
following a respiratory infection in July.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov was a conventional party apparatchik and this, more than
anything else, may have enabled him to endure the turmoil of Balkan
politics and the periodic upheavals in the Kremlin, to which he
paid fealty throughout his long career. The only known threat to
his rule was an abortive coup in 1965 organized by a handful of
party dissidents and some army officers _ believed to be the first
of its kind against a Communist regime. Zhivkov said the coup was a
pro-Chinese conspiracy; others attributed it to the rigidity of his
regime and his dutiful acquiescence to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, he boasted more than any other European Communist
leader about his intimate ties with the Soviet Union, saying the
two countries `breathe with the same lungs, and the same blood
flows in our veins'' and that they were as close as ``teeth to
lip.'' This served him well through the three decades in which
Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Bloc. In
the 1970s, a Bulgarian critic wrote that he had earned ``the
reputation of a Communist leader who had caused the minimum of
trouble for the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1989 as East European regimes were collapsing
one by one, he was brought down with the blessing of the
reform-minded Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in a bloodless putsch
organized by senior officials in the Sofia government, including
the army chief of staff, who recognized that the Communist system
in which they had all grown up was doomed and that Zhivkov would be
an obstacle to transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My connection with Gorbachev became strained,'' Zhivkov
acknowledged in a 1993 interview with Henry Kamm of The New York
Times. ``I entered into a conflict with him and he and his helpers
organized my release,'' he said, using the traditional Communist
euphemism ``release'' for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   During Zhivkov's long tenure, he authorized a forced
assimilation drive against Bulgaria's 1 million ethnic Turks in
which more than 100 were killed and 310,000 forcibly expelled. In a
campaign that aroused international condemnation in the mid-1980s,
ethnic Turks were deprived of linguistic, cultural and religious
rights. They were dismissed from jobs and rounded up at night,
trucked to police stations, and forced to change their Islamic
Turkish names into Slavic names.
</P>
<P>
   He was responsible for the construction in 1959 of concentration
camps for political prisoners just as the Soviet Union was
dismantling Stalin's Gulags. He was also said to be behind the
murder in London in 1978 of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer in
exile who had made mocking broadcasts about Zhivkov for Radio Free
Europe. In one of the strangest assassinations of the Cold War,
Markov was killed on Waterloo Bridge by an agent who used a special
umbrella to shoot a poisoned pellet into his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Zhivkov's actions paralleled those of other Soviet Bloc
leaders: brutal collectivization of farmlands; the installation of
nuclear power reactors that had a Chernobyl disaster potential; the
opening of a huge steel factory that polluted the air of the valley
of the Isker, including the nearby capital of Sofia. His legacy for
his country of 9 million included a foreign debt of $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhivkov-era concentration camps were at Kotsian, Bogdanov
Dol, Belene Island in the Danube and Lovech. As many as 1,000
prisoners were held in Lovech from 1959 to its closing in 1962 and
at least 100 died or were killed there, according to the Interior
Ministry. Disclosures of their existence came in 1990 a few months
after Zhivkov was ousted. A Ministry of Interior spokesman said,
``Todor Zhivkov at least knew or gave the orders. The problem is
that from this period there were few material traces. It was done
on the telephone.'' Or, as Zhivkov boasted in 1991: ``You won't
find Todor Zhivkov's name where the things were done.''
</P>
<P>
   He was never tried for political crimes; prosecutors concluded
it would be too difficult to make charges stick. Instead he was
tried on charges of illegally spending the equivalent of $24
million in state funds. In 1992, after a trial that lasted 18
months, during which he was scornful and defiant, he was convicted
of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison. Apparently,
the post-Zhivkov government, which included many of his former
associates, was reluctant to rake over the coals of their mutual
past.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to his heart problems and age the middle-sized man
with the long thin nose and the heavy jowls was allowed to serve
his time under house arrest at the mountain slope home of his
granddaughter overlooking Sofia, and even to make a foray to his
birthplace in Pravets, 44 miles northeast of the capital. On that
occasion he bragged, ``The whole country loves me.'' In February
1996, Bulgaria's highest court acquitted him of the embezzlement
charges though he remained under indictment on charges that he
abused human rights.

</P>
<P>
   Todor Zhivkov was born Sept. 7, 1911, in Pravets, a farm village
in the foothills of the Balkan Mountains. His father and mother,
Hristo and Maroutsa, had grown up in poverty and young Todor had to
leave school after finishing sixth grade. He was accepted in the
Secondary School of Book Printing and Graphic Arts in Sofia in 1929
and became acquainted through it with the militant Communists of
the printing trade. Within a year he was accepted in the Bulgarian
Young Communist League. From there he moved steadily forward in the
Communist party apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Bulgaria aligned itself with the Axis powers. After the
Russians defeated the Germans at Stalingrad, the Bulgarian
Communist Party organized guerrilla movements in Bulgaria and
Zhivkov, still in his mid-30s, participated as a political
commissar of a guerrilla detachment.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1944 the Soviet Army swept into Bulgaria, the
country's pro-German government was ousted and a Fatherland Front
coalition of anti-fascists was created by the Soviet occupation
force. The Bulgarian Communist Party, which numbered about 8,000 in
September 1944, became the dominant force of the Fatherland Front
and set about killing off its political opponents _ agrarians,
social democrats and monarchists _ in addition to fascists. In
Sofia alone, 2,138 death sentences were passed, marking perhaps the
bloodiest of all Communist takeovers in Soviet-occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov was credited with playing an important role in the
seizure of power as chief of the newly established Peoples Militia
with the rank of colonel. His ``Biographical Sketch'' published in
1981 in Sofia tells that ``under the direct leadership of Todor
Zhivkov,'' an armed force of Communists rounded up ``the most
reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie hiding in the villas'' at
the end of September 1944. He also wrote the orders ``to catch the
intellectual and physical murderers of the fighters for national
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the central committee of the party six months
later and as a senior official in its organizational bureau,
presided over the expansion of the party to 460,000 members. In
this capacity he also served in the autumn of 1949 as an
interrogator of Traicho Kostov, the wartime secretary of the party,
in preparation for his Stalinist show trial on charges of
collaborating with Yugoslavia's maverick Tito regime and opposing
Soviet domination. Kostov was tortured before his brief trial and
then executed.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov had been elevated to full membership in the party's
governing Politburo in 1951 in the brief era of Vulko Chervenkov,
who like his famous predecessor and brother-in-law, Georgi
Dimitrov, had spent the war years in Moscow under Stalin's thumb in
the Comintern. Then, after the death of Stalin in 1953, Nikita S.
Khrushchev ascended to power in Moscow and began replacing the
``Muscovite'' lieutenants sent out to run the Soviet satellites
with ``home Communists.'' Zhivkov's hour had arrived and he was
installed as first secretary of the party in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks following Khrushchev's epochal denunciation in
February 1956 of the crimes of Stalin, Zhivkov spoke gingerly
before his own party about the 1949 Bulgarian purge without
mentioning Kostov by name. With Bulgaria's best-known Stalinists
already relegated to the backwaters, he said only that ``innocent
comrades were accused and unjustly punished.'' He did not mention
his own role in the Kostov case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, with the backing of Khrushchev, Zhivkov added the post
of prime minister. Then, following a pattern set in other Bloc
countries he became chairman of a newly established Council of
State in 1971, the equivalent of president in other countries,
while retaining his grip on the party. His speech, according to
Georgi Markov, the writer murdered in 1978, who met him in these
years, ``frequently showed the uneasy combination of simple peasant
language and pompous phrases.'' But Markov credited him with
``natural intelligence, quick wit and a magnificent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time confident in his durability, Zhivkov began
publishing the first of 38 volumes of ``Works,'' mainly the
seemingly interminable speeches that party leaders of his era were
accustomed to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, at the height of his power, he turned his
birthplace of Pravets into a model town, reached from Sofia by a
rare four-lane highway. The house where he was born was opened as a
historical monument. In addition, Pravets got a ``historical''
museum chronicling his, and Communist Bulgaria's life, and a
factory where Bulgaria's first computer, the ``Pravets,'' was
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   When he visited in 1995, the Zhivkov home was empty and the
museum closed. But he was given the deed to the eight acres of
farmland owned by his father and collectivized by the son in the
1950s and now returned to his private hands. A circle had been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov married Dr. Mara Maleeva, a physician, in 1938. She died
in 1971. Their daughter Lyudmila, who, under her father's tutelage
became minister of culture at age 32 in 1975 and encouraged modern
art and published works by authors like Allen Ginsberg, died under
mysterious circumstances six years later. Some suspected that her
death in a bathtub at her father's official residence was a
suicide, others that she was killed by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A son, Vladimir, and two grandchildren survive.

LOGIC OF WAR, IMPERATIVE FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM C. BRADY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By the time the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, the moral line
had been crossed by the saturation bombings in Germany and the fire
bombings of Japan, as well as other large-scale bombings of
civilian centers by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The great problem of war is that it gets out of hand and grows
by what it feeds on, despite initial good intentions to keep it
limited. Consider the reasoning behind the use of the atomic bombs:
End the war sooner, impress the Soviet Union or just use it or lose
it. Take your pick. When the weapons are so extreme, war becomes
unconscionable and should be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since the opening of the nuclear age in 1945, in Korea,
Vietnam, the Middle East and elsewhere, the use of nuclear weapons
has been seriously contemplated and even threatened. One mistake,
and we would have obliterated and been obliterated in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription on the memorial Cenotaph in Hiroshima reads:
``Rest in peace, for the mistake shall not be repeated.'' Is it
unduly optimistic? No power has actually unleashed nuclear hell on
another since Nagasaki. Still, many nations have made ruthless war
on each other since the end of World War II, occasioned in large
part by the fact that the presence of nuclear weaponry had
ratcheted up the degree of violence considered permissible.
</P>
<P>
   The actual body count from carpet bombing, napalm, expanding
bullets, missiles, flame-throwers, Agent Orange, poison gas,
bacteriological weapons, ad infinitum, is a staggering figure. Two
million people perished in Korea by so-called conventional means; 3
million to 5 million in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; 1 million in
Indonesia; 2 million in Nigeria; 1 million in the Iran-Iraq War;
hundreds of thousands in Central America; several hundred thousand
within just six weeks in the Gulf War, and tens of thousands
elsewhere in the Middle East; hundreds of thousands in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 53 years since 1945, there have been about 170 wars with
22 to 25 million mortalities, as estimated by United Nations
agencies and Amnesty International. In addition, millions have
starved to death because of war and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   All of this on top of the 10 million killed in World War I, the
millions killed between the world wars, and the 40 million to 50
million dead in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With new technologies, the nature of war has been totally
transformed. The change is different in kind, not just in degree.
The quantum-leap from conventional to nuclear warfare is more like
the difference between the airplane and the spaceship, an ape and a
human being and (why look any further?) between war and peace. It
makes killing profligate and indiscriminate, causing more deaths
among noncombatants than among combatants and extending its
consequences far into the future, way beyond the proximate causes
of war.
</P>
<P>
   How can there be any just war or good war under such inhuman and
antihuman circumstances? Isn't it time to employ the same ingenuity
to making peace as we have to making war? Yet many argue that it is
human nature that impels us to warfare. It would seem rather that
the instinct for survival would incline us against
self-destruction, and therefore, against war.
</P>
<P>
   If it's true that we human beings are more inclined to love than
to hate, and that the Supreme Being is the positive force while the
Prince of Darkness is the negative force and exists only by God's
sufferance, then can we dare say that war is natural? If we are
enjoined to love our neighbors as ourselves, can we ever despise
the enemy? Are there really any good guys and bad guys or evil
empires? Aren't these all really just disguises for ephemeral power
and glory, for vanity? Isn't it true that for every Coventry there
is a Dresden, for every Pearl Harbor and Death March there is a
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for every Tet Offensive there is a My Lai?
</P>
<P>
   We have come once again to those mind-wrenching and
heartbreaking anniversaries of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We must make
real the truth that to remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki is to devote
ourselves to peace. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, representing the arch
logic of war, represent for us now the supreme imperative for
peace.

 By JOSEPH ROTBLAT  
 c.1998 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In early 1939, when the news reached me of the discovery of
fission, I was working in the Radiological Laboratory in Warsaw. I
had already begun to experiment with uranium, so it did not take me
long to set up an experiment to see whether neutrons are emitted at
fission.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it soon became clear that they are _ more neutrons are
emitted than produce fission. From this discovery it was a fairly
simple intellectual exercise to envisage a divergent chain reaction
with a vast release of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The logical sequel was that if this energy were released in a
very short time it would result in an explosion of unprecedented
power.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists in other countries, doing this type of research,
went through a similar thought process, although not necessarily
evoking the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my first reflex was to put the whole thing out of my
mind, like a person trying to ignore the first symptom of a fatal
disease in the hope that it will go away. But fear gnawed at me all
the same, and my fear was that someone would put the idea into
practice.
</P>
<P>
   At that time my life was centered on doing ``pure'' research
work, but I always believed that science should be used in the
service of mankind. The notion of utilizing my knowledge to produce
an awesome weapon of destruction was abhorrent to me.
</P>
<P>
   In my gnawing fear, the ``someone'' who might put it into
practice was precisely defined: German scientists. I had no doubt
that the Nazis would not hesitate to use any device, however
inhumane, if it gave their doctrine world domination. I convinced
myself that the only way to stop the Germans from using it against
us would be if we too had the bomb and threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   My scenario never envisaged that we should use it, not even
against the Germans. We needed the bomb for the sole purpose of
making sure that it would not be used by them.
</P>
<P>
   During this time I moved to England to spend a year with
Professor James Chadwick at Liverpool University on a grant to work
on the cyclotron, which was being completed there.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out two days after I got to Liverpool. Within a
few weeks Poland was overrun. The stories that Hitler's military
strength was all bluff, that his tanks were painted cardboard,
turned out to be wishful thinking. The might of Germany stood
revealed, and the whole of our civilization was in mortal peril.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1939 I approached Chadwick directly with an outline
of my plan for research on the feasibility of the atomic bomb. My
main idea was that for the atom bomb the chain reaction would have
to be propagated by fast neutrons. Otherwise it would not differ
much from a chemical explosive.
</P>
<P>
   We built up a small team of young but devoted physicists and
used the cyclotron to tackle some of the problems. Later we were
joined by Otto Frisch who measured fast-neutron fission
cross-sections for uranium-235. I had the idea of using plutonium,
but we had no means of making it.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that in order to make the bomb, a vast
technological effort would be required, far exceeding the manpower
and industrial potential of wartime Britain. A top-level decision
was reached to collaborate with America. And so I found myself
eventually in that ``wondrous strange'' place _ Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March 1944 I was living with the Chadwicks in their house on
the Mesa. Gen. Leslie Groves, when visiting Los Alamos, frequently
came to the Chadwicks for dinner and relaxed palaver.
</P>
<P>
   During one such conversation, Groves said the real purpose in
making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Whatever his exact
words, his real meaning was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Until then I had thought our work was to prevent a Nazi victory,
and now I was told that the weapon we were preparing was intended
for use against the very people who then were making extreme
sacrifices against Hitler's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Bohr used to come to my room at 8 a.m. to listen to the
BBC news bulletin. Sometimes Bohr stayed on and talked to me about
the social and political implications of the discovery of nuclear
energy and his worry about the dire consequences of a nuclear-arms
race between East and West which he foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   All this, and the growing evidence that the war in Europe would
be over before the bomb project was completed, made my
participation in it pointless.

<P>
   When it became evident, toward the end of 1944, that the Germans
had abandoned their bomb project, the whole purpose of my being in
Los Alamos ceased to be, and I asked for permission to leave and
return to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why did other scientists not make the same decision? The most
frequent reason so many of them stayed on the project apparently
was pure and simple scientific curiosity _ the strong urge to find
out whether their theoretical calculations and predictions would
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scientists felt that only after the now-legendary
test at Alamogordo should they enter into the debate about the use
of the bomb. Only when peace was restored would they take a hand in
efforts to ensure that the bomb would not be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, while agreeing that the project should have been
stopped when the German factor ceased to exist, were not willing to
take an individual stand because they feared it would adversely
affect their future career.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of scientists were not bothered by moral scruples.
They were quite content to leave it to others to decide how their
work would be used.
</P>
<P>
   As for myself, work on the atom bomb was proof that even pure
research soon finds applications of one kind or another. If so, I
wanted to decide how my work should be applied. I chose an aspect
of nuclear physics which would definitely be beneficial to
humanity: the applications to medicine. Thus I completely changed
the direction of my research and spent the rest of my academic
career working in a medical college and hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While this gave me personal satisfaction, I was increasingly
concerned about the personal aspects of the development of nuclear
weapons, particularly the hydrogen bomb, about which I knew from
Los Alamos. Therefore I devoted myself both to arousing the
scientific community to the danger, and to educating the general
public on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   I was instrumental in setting up the Atomic Scientists
Association in the United Kingdom, and within its framework
organized the Atom Train, a traveling exhibition which explained to
the public the good and evil aspects of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   Through these activities I came to collaborate with Bertrand
Russell. This association led to the foundation of the Pugwash
Conferences, where I met again with colleagues from the Manhattan
Project, who were also concerned about the threat to mankind that
has arisen partly from their work.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years it seems to me that our concepts of morality
seem to get thrown overboard once military action starts. It is,
therefore, most important not to allow such a situation to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Our prime effort must concentrate on the prevention of nuclear
war because in such a war not only mortality but the whole fabric
of civilization would disappear. Eventually, it is clear, we must
aim at eliminating all kinds of war.

<P>
   In early 1939, when the news reached me of the discovery of
fission, I was working in the Radiological Laboratory in Warsaw. I
had already begun to experiment with uranium, so it did not take me
long to set up an experiment to see whether neutrons are emitted at
fission.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it soon became clear that they are _ more neutrons are
emitted than produce fission. From this discovery it was a fairly
simple intellectual exercise to envisage a divergent chain reaction
with a vast release of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The logical sequel was that if this energy were released in a
very short time it would result in an explosion of unprecedented
power.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists in other countries, doing this type of research,
went through a similar thought process, although not necessarily
evoking the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my first reflex was to put the whole thing out of my
mind, like a person trying to ignore the first symptom of a fatal
disease in the hope that it will go away. But fear gnawed at me all
the same, and my fear was that someone would put the idea into
practice.
</P>
<P>
   At that time my life was centered on doing ``pure'' research
work, but I always believed that science should be used in the
service of mankind. The notion of utilizing my knowledge to produce
an awesome weapon of destruction was abhorrent to me.
</P>
<P>
   In my gnawing fear, the ``someone'' who might put it into
practice was precisely defined: German scientists. I had no doubt
that the Nazis would not hesitate to use any device, however
inhumane, if it gave their doctrine world domination. I convinced
myself that the only way to stop the Germans from using it against
us would be if we too had the bomb and threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   My scenario never envisaged that we should use it, not even
against the Germans. We needed the bomb for the sole purpose of
making sure that it would not be used by them.
</P>
<P>
   During this time I moved to England to spend a year with
Professor James Chadwick at Liverpool University on a grant to work
on the cyclotron, which was being completed there.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out two days after I got to Liverpool. Within a
few weeks Poland was overrun. The stories that Hitler's military
strength was all bluff, that his tanks were painted cardboard,
turned out to be wishful thinking. The might of Germany stood
revealed, and the whole of our civilization was in mortal peril.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1939 I approached Chadwick directly with an outline
of my plan for research on the feasibility of the atomic bomb. My
main idea was that for the atom bomb the chain reaction would have
to be propagated by fast neutrons. Otherwise it would not differ
much from a chemical explosive.
</P>
<P>
   We built up a small team of young but devoted physicists and
used the cyclotron to tackle some of the problems. Later we were
joined by Otto Frisch who measured fast-neutron fission
cross-sections for uranium-235. I had the idea of using plutonium,
but we had no means of making it.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that in order to make the bomb, a vast
technological effort would be required, far exceeding the manpower
and industrial potential of wartime Britain. A top-level decision
was reached to collaborate with America. And so I found myself
eventually in that ``wondrous strange'' place _ Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March 1944 I was living with the Chadwicks in their house on
the Mesa. Gen. Leslie Groves, when visiting Los Alamos, frequently
came to the Chadwicks for dinner and relaxed palaver.
</P>
<P>
   During one such conversation, Groves said the real purpose in
making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Whatever his exact
words, his real meaning was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Until then I had thought our work was to prevent a Nazi victory,
and now I was told that the weapon we were preparing was intended
for use against the very people who then were making extreme
sacrifices against Hitler's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Bohr used to come to my room at 8 a.m. to listen to the
BBC news bulletin. Sometimes Bohr stayed on and talked to me about
the social and political implications of the discovery of nuclear
energy and his worry about the dire consequences of a nuclear-arms
race between East and West which he foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   All this, and the growing evidence that the war in Europe would
be over before the bomb project was completed, made my
participation in it pointless.
</P>
<P>
   When it became evident, toward the end of 1944, that the Germans
had abandoned their bomb project, the whole purpose of my being in
Los Alamos ceased to be, and I asked for permission to leave and
return to Britain.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Despite vague expressions of interest in improving
relations, a Paris encounter between an American and an Iranian
last week showed there is still a very long way to go, and a very
different view on each side of the history that led to rupture and
hostility between the two countries.
 &HT;    The American, Barry Rosen, had been held as a hostage in the
U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days, which he remembered with
obviously great distress. The Iranian, Abbas Abdi, was one of the
students who directed the seizure of the Embassy in 1979. They had
not met since, and they managed to shake hands after a couple of
hours of public debate, although Abdi refused to express any
regrets for the forced imprisonment saying ``our whole nation was
held hostage for 25 years.''
 &HT;    The meeting was arranged by the Cyprus-based organization Center
for World Dialogue, one of the many non-governmental groups
springing up around the world with the aim of finding ways to
enable people to talk out their grievances when their governments
can't. It revealed, in a subtle way, what must be a raging argument
in Iran about opening up the country and making up with the United
States.
 &HT;    Although he castigated the media for failing to report what was
going on his country before the revolution, Abdi refused to say
anything about what is happening now. He wouldn't even say why he
was imprisoned for eight months in 1993 and since 1996 has been
banned from publishing or editing the newspaper with which he is
still associated. But he listed both punishments at the end of a
long resume otherwise full of his exploits on behalf of the
Khomeini revolution.
 &HT;    Evidently, the pressures for relaxation have not gone far enough
to make it safe to talk about them publicly abroad. But he did
come, and _ an ironic detail _ he was the only member of the
three-man panel who did not sport a traditional Islamic beard. The
American panelist and the French mediator both did.
 &HT;    The exchange showed how much each side still misconstrued the
history of their confrontation. Abdi said the students who invaded
the Embassy thought they would keep the hostages for a week at most

 &HT;    It is clear that the prime motive for the seizure was not to

revolutionaries feared, might make a deal with the United States to
overthrow them. The mullahs had gained considerable power through
the Mossadegh revolution in 1951, but they were ousted by a
U.S.-backed coup which restored the Shah's power in 1953. The

United States, it should be on the ``pre-1953 basis.''

against religion and Iran'' so they could get along. But as soon as

conflict with hard-line fundamentalists.

reconciliation. But grave past misreading of each other's

still ache. Ignorance is a serious handicap.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Despite vague expressions of interest in improving
relations, a Paris encounter between an American and an Iranian
last week showed there is still a very long way to go, and a very
different view on each side of the history that led to rupture and
hostility between the two countries.
 &HT;    The American, Barry Rosen, had been held as a hostage in the
U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days, which he remembered with
obviously great distress. The Iranian, Abbas Abdi, was one of the
students who directed the seizure of the Embassy in 1979. They had
not met since, and they managed to shake hands after a couple of
hours of public debate, although Abdi refused to express any
regrets for the forced imprisonment saying ``our whole nation was
held hostage for 25 years.''
 &HT;    The meeting was arranged by the Cyprus-based organization Center
for World Dialogue, one of the many non-governmental groups
springing up around the world with the aim of finding ways to
enable people to talk out their grievances when their governments
can't. It revealed, in a subtle way, what must be a raging argument
in Iran about opening up the country and making up with the United
States.
 &HT;    Although he castigated the media for failing to report what was
going on his country before the revolution, Abdi refused to say
anything about what is happening now. He wouldn't even say why he
was imprisoned for eight months in 1993 and since 1996 has been
banned from publishing or editing the newspaper with which he is
still associated. But he listed both punishments at the end of a
long resume otherwise full of his exploits on behalf of the
Khomeini revolution.
 &HT;    Evidently, the pressures for relaxation have not gone far enough
to make it safe to talk about them publicly abroad. But he did
come, and _ an ironic detail _ he was the only member of the
three-man panel who did not sport a traditional Islamic beard. The
American panelist and the French mediator both did.
 &HT;    The exchange showed how much each side still misconstrued the
history of their confrontation. Abdi said the students who invaded
the Embassy thought they would keep the hostages for a week at most
_ and that they would find support among that part of the American
population which had forced the United States out of Vietnam.
 &HT;    It is clear that the prime motive for the seizure was not to
challenge the United States but to force the resignation of the
Iranian premier and foreign minister who, the Khomeini
revolutionaries feared, might make a deal with the United States to
overthrow them. The mullahs had gained considerable power through
the Mossadegh revolution in 1951, but they were ousted by a
U.S.-backed coup which restored the Shah's power in 1953. The
memory still burns. Abdi said if relations were resumed with the
United States, it should be on the ``pre-1953 basis.''

He told them, and repeated publicly, that the ``U.S. has nothing

<P>
   Women in Latin America know they are alone when it comes to
protecting themselves against sexual crimes. But in few countries
are they as defenseless as in Mexico, where the police who are paid
to protect them often become the source of their terror.
</P>
<P>
   An entire battalion of the Mexican police _ 24 in all _ is being
accused of sexually abusing and raping three teen-age girls. Nine
of them have already been identified by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ age 13, 15 and 18 _ were walking down the streets of
Xochimilco, a suburb of southern Mexico City, at 10 o'clock on July
19, a tranquil Sunday night. A police van stopped. The girls got
in. It is unclear whether the policemen stopped to ask the girls
for directions and then forced them in or if the girls needed
directions and got into the vehicle voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once in the van, the three girls were driven to a
place that can only be described as hell _ a horse stable, property
of the police force. There, for four nights, they were forced to do
as they were told. They were humiliated by the many men in uniform
who dropped by and demanded to be served _ to be waited on and
cooked for. The girls were tortured and sexually molested. The
youngest two were raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are free _ and fortunate to be alive _ because the
18-year-old was able to escape and luckily found the rare policeman
who would listen to her and take action rather than join the tragic
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as pitiful and horrific as it is, is not surprising.
It stands as an indictment of the state of the police force in
Mexico, as well as a reminder of the fear women in Latin America
must live with every day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that an average of 82 rapes are committed
in Mexico City daily. Few are reported. Mexican women, like other
women in Latin America, know they are on their own when it comes to
sexual crimes. The justice systems see rape with the same eyes and
the same attitudes that characterize most Latin men: husbands who
believe that demanding sex is a conjugal right or judges who first
will decide if the victim of rape is an ``honest'' woman or an
``indecent'' one before reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian judge is reported to have asked a victim: ``Are you a
virgin? And if you are not, why do you complain?'' With attitudes
like this, it is not surprising that women prefer to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, those who file complaints face the sad fact that a
mere 15 percent of reported cases will be investigated. This is
hardly the first time Mexico City's police force has been accused
of rape. In 1990, five policemen were arrested for engaging in wild
rampages in which they raped 19 young women.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1991, El Financiero, one of the city's main
newspapers, reported on a woman who had been raped by policemen _
on three separate occasions. When Cristina Rivera Vargas testified
in a rental dispute against her landlady in court, she was
threatened: If she didn't retract her testimony, she would ``regret
it.'' Two days later, as she walked outside, an unidentified group
of men suggested that she do what her landlady had told her or
else, plain and simple, they would kill her. Less than two weeks
later, Rivera was forced inside a car, raped and left on the side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely she filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, she identified one of her rapists: a
police officer. She was confident that justice would be served when
prosecutors attending her case assured her ``everything was going
well.'' A month later, Rivera was again abducted, taken to a house
complete with electric-shock torture devices and beaten
unconscious. She woke up next to a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera went back to the police, this time to drop the charges.
But the policemen continued to harass her, demanding extortion
money. They set a deadline for her to deliver the amount of cash
they wanted. She didn't. Three months later she was snatched again
from home. A young man found her, at five in the morning _
staggering by the train tracks, her hands tied, her mouth taped _
and took her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's case probably followed the same fate as most of
Mexico's rape complaints _ of those 15 percent that are
investigated, only 15 percent ever make it to a verdict. Rape is
not a serious felony _ not in Mexico and not in the rest of the
region. Until recently, most Latin American constitutions saw rape
as a crime against the state, not a crime committed against the
body and soul of one woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Latin woman does not only have to fear being raped by her
husband or by a policeman. She might very well find herself walking
down the aisle, marrying her own rapist. Fourteen Latin American
countries _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
the Dominican Republic and Venezuela _ will acquit a rapist who
offers to marry the victim. In Costa Rica, the law is so extreme
that she doesn't even need to accept _ just the offer is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first opposition-party leader of
Mexico City in 70 years _ who is widely regarded as a presidential
frontrunner in 2000 _ has an opportunity to change the system, to
end the immunity with which rape is treated by Latin America's
justice systems. Indeed the director of the investigation has
announced she will ask for the maximum sentence of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that this case does not join the 85 percent of those
that never come to trial and that, if it is tried, it will not be
by men who put the onus on the victims. Or by men who think like
the Peruvian military general in ``Untold Terror: Violence Against
Women,'' a December '92 Human Rights Watch report, who said that
rape is an occasional regrettable ``excess'' committed by his
troops. ``Boys,'' he said, are far from their families and suffer a
great deal of tension because of the nature of combat. They get
their aggression out by raping women.''
</P>
<P>
   With protectors like this, where can a woman in Latin America
start feeling safe?

 By PAUL BERMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In December 1997, a man with the wonderfully Aztec and Spanish
name Cuauhtimoc Cardenas became the mayor of Mexico City and
initiated a series of reforms, one of which, the most delicate of
all, took place in plain view.
 &HT;    It was an earnest municipal campaign to clear the unlicensed
sidewalk vendors from the downtown zone around Mexico City's
central plaza, the Zocalo. Sidewalk vending in that particular
neighborhood is an ancient custom. In Aztec times, when Mexico City
already figured as one of the world's largest cities, a market
stood on that very spot, near the Main Temple on one side of the
plaza. And the vendors have never disappeared.
 &HT;    Photographs from the 19th century show what the vendors look
like today: a lone person, often a woman, squatting by a tiny
carpet on the sidewalk, displaying a pathetic handful of goods for
sale.
 &HT;    Sidewalk vending, when times are good, can offer a useful way
for a hard-strapped person to earn a few honest pesos. But times
have not been good. Mexico City's population, always enormous, has
in recent years swollen to 8.5 million in the Federal District
(where Cardenas is mayor), plus another 10 million outside the
district lines.
 &HT;    Then, in 1994, the entire country underwent a series of
disasters. There were Zapatista guerrillas in the southern state of
Chiapas. There were narco-traffickers in the north. There was a
peso crisis, which produced an economic depression. There were
assassinations and money scandals at the loftiest levels of the
federal government.
 &HT;    In Mexico City, a vague, shapeless social collapse was under
way. The number of holdups, rapes and murders became truly
terrifying, not just in the poor neighborhoods. And sidewalk
vending around the Zocalo grew to proportions that no one had ever
seen, and took on sinister colors.
 &HT;    What was the origin of those many disasters? In Cardenas' view,
it lies in Mexico's political system and especially in its ruling
party, the PRI (pronounced pree, from the Spanish initials for
Institutional Revolutionary Party).
 &HT;    The PRI is like nothing the United States has ever known. It is
a political party, run by ordinary politicians, but it is also a
mass organization, spread across a vast geography of business
groups, trade unions, storefront service centers and poor people's
associations, all of them linked in underground networks of
''corruption and complicities,'' in Cardenas' description.
 &HT;    The party has known how to stay in power for almost 70 years _
either by winning popular support, or by winning fixed elections,
or (when not even a fixed election will do) by violent repression.
Cardenas was a PRI man himself in the past. But 10 years ago,
having lost his faith, he left the party and set out to overthrow
it.
 &HT;    For a long time he seemed to get nowhere at all. Then last
year's elections turned out to be amazingly free, and even fair,
apart from the PRI-controlled TV and press coverage and a few
old-fashioned irregularities in the southern states. Cardenas, as
the new mayor, found himself occupying Mexico's second most visible
office, after the presidency.
 &HT;    His Party of the Democratic Revolution captured the city
council, plus a number of other offices around the country. A
second opposition party _ a right-wing movement, in contrast to
Cardenas' left-wing movement _ likewise advanced, mostly in the
north. Mexico held its breath. Everyone understood that, in spite
of the elections, the PRI remained the country's dominant political
organization.
 &HT;    In Mexico, presidents rule like kings, and the PRI still
controls the presidency, in the person of Ernesto Zedillo, who has
held the office since 1994. But in the year 2000, there will be a
new election for president.
 &HT;    Short of some awful new development, that election too will
probably be free _ possibly even fair, more or less. Cardenas, if
he does well as mayor, will be a strong candidate. Already there
are polling statistics that show him to be the front-runner _
though other opposition candidates have stepped forward.
 &HT;    And, with Cardenas in City Hall, suddenly it became obvious
that, like so many other authoritarian countries during the last
revolutionary decade, Mexico too might be plunging at last into
democracy and modern life - a thrilling thing to watch, but also
slightly alarming.
 &HT;    It has to be said that in his first months in office, out of
nervousness or bad luck, Cardenas has not in fact done especially
well. He made a series of early appointments that turned out to be
ill advised and had to be withdrawn. His chief of staff made wild
and unjustified accusations against the PRI (instead of sober and
accurate accusations, which would have been wild enough), and had
to resign.
 &HT;    The new mayor did take some useful steps _ he tried to shore up
the leaky water system, initiated a reform of the police (many of
whom are criminals themselves), ordered an end to bribes (though
bribery has always been how things get done). Yet none of that
attracted any attention. Then he sent the police into the downtown
streets to arrest a few sidewalk vendors and confiscate their
paltry merchandise.
 &HT;    In mid-April of this year, some scuffling broke out between
vendors and police. In response, a committee of shopkeepers decided
to add pressure of their own by calling on their fellow shopkeepers
to close their stores to protest against the sidewalk vendors and
encourage the mayor in his campaign.
 &HT;    It was not much of a demonstration, by the standards of the
Zocalo _ where, on the day of the shopkeepers' protest, hundreds of
Indians continued a months-long marathon sit-in on behalf of the
Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and hundreds of other people
persisted in a similar marathon in the name of Pancho Villa for the
right to squat on city-owned land, and still others kept up a
months-long picket line against the labor policies of the Zscalo's
famous National Pawnshop. The shopkeepers' demonstration, by humble
contrast, was intended to last a single lunch hour, and failed even
at that.
 &HT;    A mere handful closed their doors and faithfully attended their
committee's rally, on Calle Corregidora, the street running behind
the National Palace. Still, a group of journalists came out to
report on the latest protest, and 23 police officers arrived to
keep the peace, should the peace have needed keeping. Then a mob of
400 thugs came running down the street and tore the shopkeepers'
tiny demonstration to shreds.
 &HT;    The TV news that night showed enraged young toughs racing into a
store and hurling things. It was a full-scale riot, except that
riots tend to be spontaneous, and in the days after the mob attack
on Calle Corregidora, no one believed that anything spontaneous had
occurred.
 &HT;    I went tramping around after Cardenas in the next few days, just
to see how he was going to respond to that first, violent challenge
to his administration. I could see that people reacted powerfully
to him. He toured an elevated section of a new metro line under
construction, and a group of men in the street below rooted him on
by chanting his first name: ``Kwow-TAY-mock! Kwow-TAY-mock!''
 &HT;    He sat with me in the booth of a middle-class restaurant,
talking about Nafta (he supports it, with grave reservations),
immigration (he thinks the United States and Mexico have failed to
discuss it adequately) and military interventions (he thinks every
country is capable of solving its own problems and ought to be left
alone, especially by the United States).
 &HT;    And, as he chatted and sipped his coffee, diners got up from
their tables to shake his hand and introduce their children _ a
steady trickle of excited voters, thrilled at the historic
opportunity to be in physical contact with their hero.
 &HT;    Exactly what quality in him set off those responses was hard to
see. He cut the ribbon on a new orphanage, listened to 10-year-olds
deliver orations that must have been written by the teachers'
union, visited the city council _ and, in each of those settings,
he seemed grave and tranquil, but also melancholy beyond words, as
if never once in his 64 years has he enjoyed a cheerful moment.
 &HT;    Iron weights seemed to pull the sides of his mouth down toward
his chin. His oratory followed a rhythmic pattern that emphasized
every eighth or ninth syllable, which, after a few minutes, got to
be grating. In my hearing he never did say anything memorable.
 &HT;    At City Hall, when he got up to leave a meeting, the reporters
mobbed him so tightly as to pin his arms, and thrust their plastic
tape recorders at his melancholy face, and called out questions
about street vendors. And like a bored sheriff announcing the day's
eviction, he replied that Mexico City has an ordinance against
sidewalk vending downtown, and the law must be respected.
 &HT;    He was more voluble with me, if only for the purpose of making
an abstract point.
 &HT;    ``The first step that has to be taken in Mexico,'' he said, as
one person after another hurried to our table to eye their new
mayor or pump his hand, ``is to re-establish, to recover, a state
of law. To make the law prevail over any other interests. To make
the authorities respect the law, and make everyone respect it.''
 &HT;    He was always courteous. But he was never warm. He visited a
welfare center for what the Mexicans call indigenous people,
meaning the Indians. And when the speeches were over, he found
himself for a brief instant alone on the sidewalk with a short,
squat woman, dressed in a white skirt and yellow apron, with a
gray-and-white rebozo and bright colored ribbons tied to her black
braid _ the costume of the Mazahua people.
 &HT;    Almost pleading, she said, ``Can't you find a kindness for the
sidewalk vendors who are indigenous?''
 &HT;    The mayor gazed down at her and said, for her ears alone, ``The
law must be respected'' _ and added not a word of reassurance.
 &HT;    It was in 1934, the year of Cuauhtimoc Cardenas' birth, when his
father, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, became president of the Republic.
Lazaro Cardenas tried to bestow on all of Mexico the same mestizo
quality, Indian and Spanish, that he had already bestowed on his
son's name.
 &HT;    He took the communal lands of the Indians and the peasants, and
tried to modernize them. He nationalized the American oil
companies. He took the party that would eventually be called the
PRI and made it an organization for everyone, from the most
powerful of generals to the poorest of the poor _ a mass party for
a single-party state (though in Lazaro Cardenas' system there was
always room for opposition parties, too, so long as the opposition
agreed never to win any elections).
 &HT;    He was a forward-looking socialist and, at the same time, an
old-fashioned feudal strongman. And everything he did worked well
enough _ not just during the years of his own presidency, from 1934
to 1940, but for the next few decades. Industry grew. Poverty
diminished. The arts blossomed. In the riddle of Mexican history,
Lazaro Cardenas was the solution _ the man who showed how to pull
the country together.
 &HT;    Who is Cuauhtimoc Cardenas, then? He is the heir to the solution
to the riddle of the history of Mexico. He is the son of the man
who rescued Mexico from the stony solitude that Octavio Paz
describes in his poems.
 &HT;    Cuauhtimoc Cardenas does not have to be eloquent. His first name
(which is that of the last Aztec emperor) and last name (which is
that of the greatest of all Mexican presidents) are already a poem.
The downward turn of his lips speaks for centuries of suffering
without his saying a word. He has only to let himself be seen for
millions of Mexicans to remember the hope for a better future that
was brought to them by his father.
 &HT;    He is a man who is loved by many, but cannot explain to the many
why they love him or where he intends to take them. A man who
inspires people, but also deflates them. A man of hope, who leaves
his admirers in a fatalist mood. You could almost conclude _ if
your expectations of Cardenas were very high, and if you wanted to
see Mexico undergo a full-scale revolution, which might be a good
idea _ that, at this early stage, he is failing.
 &HT;    What does it all add up to, now that Cardenas has spent a good
six months in City Hall battling the PRI and its sidewalk vendors
and trying to uphold his father's populism and making laconic
statements about respect for law?
 &HT;    I put that question to Cardenas' leading national rival outside
of the PRI _ Vicente Fox, the governor of Guanajuato, who is
already running for president as a candidate of the right-wing
National Action Party. Fox spoke of Cardenas, from across the
ideological divide, with a good deal more respect than he granted
to any of the leaders of the PRI.
 &HT;    ``I recognize him fully as being one of the great contributors
to democracy in Mexico,'' Fox said, though he hastened to credit
his own party too.
 &HT;    But from Fox's point of view, Cardenas has nothing more to
offer.
 &HT;    ``He has no project, he has no talent, he has no vision beyond
looking backward. If we Mexicans let him have the country, the
country will have to go back to 1930 _ back to the communal lands,
back to populism, back to the domination of a strong state, and
back to the old socialist policy of taking away from some to give
to others.''
 &HT;    That was the raillery of a political opponent, and shouldn't be
taken too seriously, except as a challenge to Cardenas to define
his new-style leftism more precisely.
 &HT;    How can Cardenas offer any such definition, though? Now that he
is mayor, his own actions have to speak on his behalf. Yet the
actions, his municipal reforms, seem lost in inertia. Possibly that
is because Mexico City's problems would overwhelm any mayor, or
possibly it is because the PRI has outmaneuvered him, with its army
of storefront organizers and vendor mafias and party-run trade
unions.
 &HT;    But the problem may also be that Cardenas and his Party of the
Democratic Revolution are befuddled by their own mix of populism
and legalist severity, and simply don't know what to do, apart from
trying to rip up the corrupt old institutions of the PRI.
 &HT;    On the day after Cardenas' electoral triumph last year, Paz had
published a political commentary called ''The New Epoch'' in La
Reforma. It was the last article Paz saw into print before lapsing
into the final phase of his illness. Three days before the vendor
riot, Paz died.
 &HT;    The death was regarded as a national tragedy, mourned with a
passion that would be inconceivable in a country like the United
States, where many more people read books, and literature is much
less esteemed.
 &HT;    Paz, in his later years, tended to sympathize with President
Zedillo, though not in any formal or rigid way. He sympathized with
him, mostly because he worried about disorder, and because he
thought that Zedillo had chosen a suitably moderate pace of reform
(and perhaps, too, because Paz was vain, and enjoyed rubbing
shoulders with the powerful and receiving his share of favors).
 &HT;    In any case, Paz did not admire Cardenas. And once the returns
had come in and Cardenas had been elected mayor, the poet worried.
 &HT;    He worried that, in the days to come, Cardenas and his
triumphant allies were going to act like left-wing sectarians, and
the leaders and rank-and-filers of the defeated PRI were going to
undermine the democracy that had brought about their own defeat,
and all hell was going to break loose.
 &HT;    Today it's easy to see the realism in Paz's fears. The mob
attack on Calle Corregidora showed that, in Mexico City, the old
PRI institutions are fully capable of turning violent if they feel
challenged. In Chiapas, the standoff between the forces of the PRI
and the Zapatista guerrillas has gotten more murderous, during the
last few months. Things could perfectly well get worse in Mexico.
And yet, on a national scale, things have not gotten worse.
 &HT;    Instead, Mexico appears to be easing itself, one dainty toe at a
time, into democratic waters. It ought to be obvious that Cardenas,
more than Zedillo, deserves the credit _ even if Zedillo has had
the wisdom to refrain from committing any gruesome enormities when
elections have gone against his own party.
 &HT;    By getting elected mayor, Cardenas demonstrated to ordinary
Mexicans that power can alternate from one party to another, not
just in faraway states near the American border but in the capital
city, without leading the country into civil war or political
violence. Isn't that a revolution _ at least the first step toward
a revolution, in the field of party politics?
 &HT;    Paz was right to call for a civic spirit and a lowered temper.
Cardenas, in his half year in office, has delivered exactly that _
no more, and no less. The revolution, in its first step, turns out
to be evolution _ halting, uninspired and partial. And yet in the
history of Mexico, there has never been a more democratic moment.

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    There was nothing out of the ordinary about the slender glass
tubes of blood that arrived in Sharon S. Rotun's laboratory late in
the afternoon of March 20, 1998.
 &HT;    A pale, stocky woman with the impatient manner of someone who is
overworked and underpaid, Rotun was the microbiology supervisor at
United Hospital Medical Center, a small community hospital in the
working-class town of Port Chester, N.Y., just north of Manhattan
in Westchester County.
 &HT;    The two blood cultures were among roughly a dozen sent to the
lab that day. Whoever ordered the testing was evidently in a hurry,
Rotun recalls, because he or she hadn't even bothered to scribble
the usual instructions on the accompanying slip.
 &HT;    The blood belonged to a 79-year-old Westchester County man, a
retired New York City narcotics detective who had been admitted to
the hospital earlier that day. For the past year and a half, the
detective's kidneys had been failing him, a condition that required
him to undergo dialysis three times a week.
 &HT;    On most days, he tolerated the tedious procedure with a smile.
But on the morning of March 20, the retired detective awoke in an
unusually sour mood.
 &HT;    ``He didn't want to eat; he didn't want to get dressed; he
didn't want to get washed,'' said his daughter Carole, who agreed
to be interviewed on the condition that she be identified only by
her first name and that her father not be identified at all.
 &HT;    She got him dressed, quickly served him breakfast and, despite
his protests, sent him to the local dialysis center. ``You have to
go,''' the daughter told him. ``You have no choice.''
 &HT;    The old man was feverish, short of breath and so disoriented he
could barely speak by the time the kidney specialist, Dr. Sam
Natarajan, saw him. Natarajan immediately suspected staphylococcus
aureas, a bacteria that frequently causes illness among dialysis
patients, who become infected when the microbes enter the
bloodstream along their intravenous lines.
 &HT;    The doctor performed just enough dialysis to clear the fluid
backed up in his patient's lungs _ a ``dry cleaning,'' in the argot
of renal disease _ and then called an ambulance to take the man to
the hospital. Twelve hours later, the patient was dead.
 &HT;    In what turned out to be the final hours of his life, the ailing
detective was hooked up to an intravenous drip of vancomycin, a
powerful antibiotic that has been the ultimate weapon against staph
for the last three decades. Doctors regard vancomycin as the drug
of last resort, the medicine they rely on to kill germs that are
too vicious to respond to anything else. Normally, vancomycin
begins attacking staph in the bloodstream immediately.
 &HT;    ``We call vancomycin `the big gun,''' Rotun says. Which is why,
when she first examined the lab results from the dead detective,
she did not believe what she saw.
 &HT;    A staph infection was indeed flourishing in the detective's
blood when he died. But not just any strain of staph. This was a
rare and unusually dangerous germ, a supermicrobe that
infectious-disease experts have been dreading for years. It goes by
the name of VISA, for Vancomycin Intermediate-Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureas, and it represents the bacterial world's most
potent counterattack against antibiotics.
 &HT;    As soon as the results of the detective's blood tests came in,
Rotun posted signs all over her laboratory, instructing her
subordinates not to give out any information. The last thing the
hospital needed, she thought, was a swarm of reporters generating
panic over a killer superbug that could be spreading through the
hospital's corridors.
 &HT;    Not even Carole, the detective's daughter, was told. Instead,
Rotun repeated the lab tests. Then, when she had convinced herself
there was no mistake, she picked up the phone and called her
longtime colleague and friend, Ginny McMath, United Hospital's
infection control officer.
 &HT;    ```I hope you're sitting down,''' Rotun told McMath. ``I think
we have the first VISA in New York State.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    In recent years, it has become fashionable in the media to warn
of the exotic new infectious diseases percolating in faraway lands.
The gruesome Ebola virus, which swept through Zaire three years
ago, has captured the public imagination in books and on film. But
while Hollywood has been busy making scary movies,
infectious-disease experts know that the bigger danger is in our
own backyard: garden variety germs that for decades have been so
easily felled by antibiotics that most people, including some
scientists, naively assumed they were no longer a threat.
 &HT;    For the past decade, however, scientists at the Federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and all over the
world have been sounding alarm bells about the growth of antibiotic
resistance, a problem that has been fueled by patients who demand
antibiotics for every bout of the sniffles and by doctors who give
in to such demands. The list of dangerously virulent drug-resistant
microbes is growing all the time: streptococcus pneumoniae, which
causes pneumonia, childhood ear infections and meningitis;
mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, and neisseria
gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.
 &HT;    But none are as frightening to medical experts as the VISA
strains of staph. Within the past 18 months, the CDC has documented
the first four cases ever, the most recent being that of the New
York detective. Their emergence is an ominous harbinger of what Dr.
Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and
Drug Resistance at Tufts, calls ``the worst thing that could happen
in clinical infectious disease.''
 &HT;    One reason for concern is that staph is a particularly common
and robust organism; it lives on the skin and in the nostrils of
otherwise healthy people as part of what scientists call the
``natural flora,'' where it is relatively harmless. But if it gains
access to the body through scrapes, cuts or surgical incisions, as
it often does, it can cause a range of ailments, from pus-oozing
cuts to sepsis, an often lethal infection of the bloodstream.
 &HT;    Children who scrape their knees are susceptible to staph, as are
housewives who cut their hands in the kitchen or anybody else with
an open wound. Should VISA strains become common, simple cuts and
scrapes could become mortal wounds.
 &HT;    To complicate matters, hospitals are already breeding grounds
for a host of dangerous bugs. Each year, nearly 90,000 patients in
the United States die of a hospital-acquired infection, and many of
those cases are theoretically treatable with antibiotics. Staph is
often the culprit, picking on vulnerable patients such as the
elderly, the immunocompromised and those undergoing surgery. The
emergence of an untreatable strain of staph would put virtually any
healthy person at risk, and could turn a bad situation into a
disastrous one.
 &HT;    As Levy says, ``Right now, we are still in most cases able to
use vancomycin. Now let's say we lose vancomycin. Where are the
deaths going to go? They're going to go up. This number could
double.''
 &HT;    Now that these bugs are figuring out ways to evade the very
miracle drugs that have always worked so well against them, there
is little on the horizon to keep the virulent new supergerms in
check. Joshua Lederberg, a Rockefeller University professor who is
widely regarded as one of the nation's leading authorities on
infectious disease, warns that far too little attention is being
paid to the threat of drug-resistant germs.
 &HT;    ``The odds of Ebola breaking out are quite low, but the stakes
are very high,'' Lederberg says. ``With antibiotic resistance, the
odds are certain and the stakes are just as high. It is happening
right under our noses.''
 &HT;    And it is happening at a particularly precarious moment, when
many hospitals are cutting back on services as they struggle to
survive the changing economics of health care. United Hospital in
Port Chester, for example, reflecting national trends, plans to
``outsource'' Rotun's lab. Meanwhile, drug manufacturers, which in
the early 1980s all but abandoned development of new antibiotics on
the theory that they were no longer needed, find themselves behind
the curve. They are hustling to invent new treatments and put them
on pharmacy shelves. And that is why the emergence of the
vancomycin-resistant strains is viewed as such a worrisome public
health threat.
 &HT;    The next generation of new antimicrobials is, by the industry's
own estimate, at least several years away, creating a dangerous
window in which the virulent new microbes might be able to spread
unchecked. If that happens, modern medicine might revert to the
days before penicillin, when sore throats could become fatal and
patients who walked into the hospital for routine surgery might be
carried out in coffins.
 &HT;    ``If we have no antibiotics, it reopens the whole question of
intrusive surgical procedures and vastly changes the calculus of
their safety,'' Lederberg says. In the pre-penicillin era, people
occasionally died while having their appendixes removed _ not
because the surgery itself was dangerous but because germs crept
into the patients' incisions, causing infections that spread to the
bloodstream and raged out of control.
 &HT;    ``Those days,'' Lederberg says, ``have a chance of coming back
if the drugs we have been relying on just stop working.''
 &HT;    As the race to find new drugs proceeds, supermicrobes such as
the one that infected the New York detective will undoubtedly
continue to flourish, leaving a trail of nervous public-health
officials and grieving families in their wake.
 &HT;    Three days after the former detective died, mourners gathered at
a stately stone church in the town of Harrison. On that same day,
with utmost secrecy, officials at United Hospital were frantically
trying to determine where the vancomycin-resistant staph bug came
from and, more important, whether the germ had spread.
 &HT;    The unenviable job of getting to the bottom of those questions
fell to Ginny McMath, the hospital's infection-control official.
The name of the detective was familiar to her; she remembered him
from a previous admission in January, when he was treated for a
staph infection that was resistant to methicillin.
 &HT;    He was given vancomycin for several weeks, but the episode
earned him an entry into a red loose-leaf binder where McMath
carefully catalogues every instance of a drug-resistant strain at
the hospital. The case fell under the worrisome category of MRSA _
methicillin resistant staph aureas.
 &HT;    When Rotun called with news of the detective's blood tests,
McMath was alarmed but not altogether surprised. A 79-year-old man
with a history of kidney disease and methicillin-resistant staph,
she knew, was the optimal candidate for a VISA strain.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like the natural experiment that we would do in
the laboratory except that in this case, the patient is the Petri
dish,'' explains Fred C. Tenover, chief of the CDC's Nosocomial
Pathogens Laboratory Branch, the national reference laboratory for
hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infections.
 &HT;    McMath immediately began to track down everyone who had contact
with the detective in the days before he died. Working with
Natarajan, the kidney specialist, she identified 44 people _
dialysis workers, doctors, nurses and family members _ who might
have been exposed to the deadly microbe. Each had their nostrils
and, in some cases, their hands cultured to see if they were
``colonized'' with the bug.
 &HT;    Making the notifications was a delicate task. The cause of the
detective's death had not been made public, and Natarajan and
McMath were careful not to reveal too much.
 &HT;    ``There's a fear that people won't want to come here,'' McMath
said. It was left to Natarajan to call the detective's family. ``I
told them that he had a staph infection, but there was a
peculiarity and we wanted to see if anybody else had the same type
of infection,'' he said. ``I didn't want to cause them any panic.''
 &HT;    That instinct _ not to cause panic _ is an understandable one,
experts say, but it can also lead to public-health problems of its
own. Suppressing information about a potentially deadly germ might
lead people who have been exposed to it not to take the testing
seriously. Indeed, Carole's daughter declined at first to be
cultured, thinking it was unnecessary.
 &HT;    On April 24, one month to the day after the detective's funeral,
Carole was driving to work when she heard a report over the car
radio that an elderly dialysis patient in Port Chester had died of
a rare staph infection. Her father was not identified, but it did
not take much to put two and two together.
 &HT;    ``I didn't realize how serious a bacteria it was until I heard
it on the radio,'' she said. ``It really upset me that they were
not more forthcoming.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, 14 of the 44 people who were tested were
carrying staph aureas. Of the 14, 2 _ a doctor and a patient _
harbored a germ that was resistant to methicillin. Genetic typing
conducted by Tenover's lab, however, found that none of these bugs
were identical to the one that infected Carole's father. It was an
encouraging sign; the deadly bug, it seems, is buried with the
detective.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, McMath's investigation, supervised by both state
health officials and the CDC, quickly established that neither the
hospital nor the dialysis center was a problem. Dr. David Ackman,
who directs the state's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control,
said infection control practices were meticulous at both. Even so,
Ackman said: ``We were very concerned. We wanted to make sure that
there weren't other people carrying this around.''
 &HT;    Ackman and other infectious-disease experts no longer view these
episodes as isolated incidents. They are more like bullets that are
becoming increasingly difficult to dodge. ``We were lucky,'' says
Tenover, who has no trouble spinning out scenarios for the near
future that are far worse.
 &HT;    ``The next time it may be somebody who is on an open hospital
ward, or maybe they have been in the hospital for several weeks, or
been a lot of places before their infection is recognized. Or it
might be someone in a nursing home that can spread it among 80
patients, in which case we are going to have a big job on our
hands.''

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    History has it that the first thing Alexander Graham Bell said
over the telephone was: ``Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.''
 &HT;    What he would say today is: ``Hey, just checkin' in. Get back to
me whenever.''
 &HT;    Americans don't communicate with each other anymore. We check
in. We whip out our vest-pocket cellulars, punch in the digits and
give our coordinates, as if we're at a Loran station somewhere.
 &HT;    Hi. I'm 32,000 feet over Lake Erie ... I'm sitting in the bar
car on the 5:04 to Darien ... I'm at a pay phone across from Gate
41B on Concourse D at O'Hare ... I'm on the ferry to the Vineyard
... I'm in the passing lane between West Newton and the Weston
tolls ... I'm in the middle of the seventh-inning stretch at Yankee
Stadium. Just checkin' in ...
 &HT;    Checking in used to be a California thing.
 &HT;    ``I'll be at 526-7981 for the next hour,'' the Tony Roberts
character says over the phone in ``Play It Again, Sam,'' while
Woody Allen, the exasperated New Yorker, rolls his eyes. ``Then
I'll be at 696-0706 until after lunch. Then you can reach me at
237-7921 ...''
 &HT;    Now, it's become the national pastime. A satellite goes on the
fritz for a couple of hours, and we wail and shake our beepers at
the heavens because we can't check in or tell who's trying to check
in with us.
 &HT;    We may fantasize about escaping to a bungalow on a Caribbean
isle with no electrical outlets, blissfully ignorant of the Dow and
the latest White House scandal. But when Hurricane Herbie hits the
Cape and knocks out our power for 72 hours, we start banging on our
neighbors' doors, craving external contact.
 &HT;    Since we have the gadgets _ the car phones and Airfones and
voice mails and e-mails and pagers and digicams linked to laptops _
we can't bear to be incommunicado. There's no need for it anymore.
 &HT;    More than that, there's no excuse for it. To have one's beeper
or cellular switched off, to avoid picking up one's messages, is to
go Garbo. It's inefficient, antisocial and damned inconsiderate.
The option of staying in touch, or even being reachable, has become
an obligation.
 &HT;    No doubt, much of our checking in is worthwhile, even necessary.
We need to tell our 12 o'clock appointment that we're gridlocked
across town. We want to let our spouse know that the Little League
practice has been called off and save her a 45-minute diversion. We
have to tell whomever the Sears deliveryman checks in with that we
won't be at home between 10 and 11 after all and don't want the
Lady Kenmore dumped on the front lawn.
 &HT;    But much of the time, we seem to be checking in because we can.
We're fascinated by our teletoys and delighted with the freedom
they give us. Those old barriers of time and space have vanished.
We can check in from anywhere with anyone any time we please. So we
do. Hey, you'll never guess where I'm calling you from ...
 &HT;    What we're saying isn't nearly as important as the fact that
we're saying it. The message is merely an excuse to use the medium.
We don't merely check in with one another. We check in with the
Internet and television too, fingering our mouses and remotes,
clicking and zapping. Even the verbs we use to describe our
activities _ surfing, browsing, grazing _ speak to the superficial,
the transitory. We've become human hummingbirds, flitting and
hovering, dipping in our beaks for a quick taste, then zipping off.
 &HT;    We check in with 60 cable channels in 20 seconds, stopping to
absorb the latest update on the New York-Baltimore game as it pops
up on the CNN streamer, then surfing the endless wave from 2
through 99 and back to 2.
 &HT;    We don't miss a thing, but how much do we retain amid the
relentless input, the hundreds of images, the factoids, the sound
snippets? We've confused information with knowledge; we know less
and less about more and more.
 &HT;    All this checking in has made us twitchy and perfunctory. We
jump at the sound of a beep, then put that beep on hold to answer
another beep. We'd rather leave a 15-second message than have a
five-minute discussion, because five minutes is what an hour used
to be.
 &HT;    We don't have time, or we think we don't, for depth, for
reflection, for the provocative give-and-take of a conversation
that stimulates and satisfies. We take our frenetic tempo from
computers that deal in nano-seconds and from television, with its
sound bites, quick cuts and happy talk.
 &HT;    Our grandparents didn't have the luxury, or the curse, of
instant global communication. Their world was smaller and slower by
necessity. They didn't know anybody they hadn't met, and they saw
and spoke with the same people on a daily basis. They didn't need
to check in.
 &HT;    Their world _ a city block, a rural village _ may have seemed
mundane and limiting to them at times, but it provided them with a
leisurely, face-to-face intimacy and the assurance that they would
find out most of what was important to them. Our world, for better
but mostly for worse, is nothing like that.
 &HT;    Our teletoys have put us in touch _ theoretically, anyway _ with
an endless number of people and an infinite amount of information
that is constantly being updated. If we're incommunicado for very
long, we risk missing _ who knows what?
 &HT;    So we can't afford to be out of touch, or to hover in one place
for too long. That's why we pay for call waiting, why we feel
compelled to disengage from the conversation we're in on the random
chance that a pending one might be more important. The future
always seems more intriguing to us than the present, especially if
it won't stop clicking.
 &HT;    The electronic scolds that were created as our servants _ the
chirping cell phone, the shrieking pager, the flashing MESSAGE
PENDING, the blinking red light on the phone console, the
stentorian voice declaring ``You've got mail'' _ have become our
masters. URGENT! they command. DROP EVERYTHING THIS VERY MINUTE!
 &HT;    So we do, because the scolds have made jittery compulsives of
us. We feel negligent, even guilty, if we don't interrupt what
we're doing to respond immediately. Then we check our e-mail, only
to find an ad telling us how we can get rid of unwanted e-mail.
 &HT;    Back before telephones and telegraphs, time and distance
precluded checking in for its own sake. In Jesus' time, it took 46
days to travel from Rome to Jerusalem. It took weeks for King
George III to hear about the Boston Tea Party, and weeks more to do
anything about it. The Pony Express, which still took 10 days to
bring mail from Missouri to California, charged $5 an ounce in
1860. Nobody used it just to say hi.
 &HT;    Communication was more deliberate and less trivial precisely
because time and distance demanded it. Now that we can reach out
and touch someone (and vice versa) in a millisecond, the teletoys
have distorted our sense not only of time and distance, but
importance. Because we have achieved instant communication, we
expect instant response, whether or not it's merited. The form and
content of the response scarcely matter. What we're after is not so
much communication as acknowledgment.
 &HT;    To not carry a cell phone or a pager, to not have voice mail, to
not be on line, is to all but declare yourself a hermit. The
concept of being out of touch, literally unreachable, no longer
exists. It's considered Luddite even to desire it. What do you
mean, I can't reach you?
 &HT;    The sad thing is, we've confused reaching with communicating.
All too often, we make the connection and realize we have nothing
worth saying. If so much of our checking in seems hurried,
perfunctory and shallow, it may be that we have no need, or desire,
to have a conversation in the first place.
 &HT;    Or perhaps we've lost the skills or don't grasp the form
anymore. The success of the film ``My Dinner With Andre'' was
considered remarkable _ who thought American audiences would sit
still for two characters (especially middle-age males) having an
expansive conversation over a meal? And that was in 1981, when
cable was still a novelty and the Internet an academic plaything.
 &HT;    The most notable thing about that conversation was that it was
face-to-face. It could not have happened over the Internet and
probably not by phone. The nuances, the natural rhythms and pauses,
the heads nodding and shaking, would have been lost.
 &HT;    The gadgets we invented to make conversation easier inhibit real
conversation by their very nature. Their speed encourages
superficiality because we can dial up or log on before we have
anything to say. Their portability allows us to check in while
we're doing something else _ driving a car, shopping for groceries,
watching a ballgame. So undivided attention has become an oxymoron.
 &HT;    Since we can reach people without reaching them, just by leaving
a detailed message after the tone, we don't need a conversation. In
fact, the whole idea can be not to have a conversation, but to
return the obligation to have one.
 &HT;    That's why so many business executives leave voice mails at 5:40
p.m. from their car phones, knowing that their intended recipient
has already left for the day. It's the checking-in version of
``Tag, you're it!''
 &HT;    Teletoys were designed to bring the remote into proximity (``Mr.
Watson, come here''). The truth is, they merely create the illusion
of proximity while keeping us at a distance. All we leave is a
scent _ a disembodied voice scratchy with tunnel static, a rambling
run-on paragraph on a cyberscreen, a pager number that seems
vaguely familiar.
 &HT;    We can leave that scent from the other side of the planet, where
today is already yesterday _ or not quite tomorrow. We don't feel
that we need to connect; time and space make that impractical
anyway. We check in, and we check out. The global village we talk
about is more of a global hotel.
 &HT;    Yet even if we do connect _ and sometimes we're caught
unprepared when we do, surprised that the person we're calling has
actually answered _ we're still at a remove. Our teletoys may erase
time and distance, but we remain remote, unseen. We miss all of the
visual cues that have always helped humans understand (and not
misunderstand) one another.
 &HT;    The Internet chat room is the epitome of checking in. We sit by
ourselves and log on to the world with a screen name. We send
cryptic messages to strangers we ``know'' because we've been on
line with them before, but who may not be anything like who they
say they are.
 &HT;    We all talk at once, and a computer chip decides who has
priority. We talk in lower-case fragments, in acronyms. We talk to
names who leave the room before we know they've clicked off and
checked in elsewhere. No matter. Somebody else will be checking in.
The chat room is always full.

<P>
   While the end of the Cold War transformed the political
landscape of Europe, it did little to ameliorate India's security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of China and continued strains with Pakistan made the
1980s and 1990s a greatly troubling period for India. At the global
level, the nuclear-weapons states showed no signs of moving
decisively toward a world free of atomic danger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was extended
indefinitely and unconditionally in 1995, perpetuating the
existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of five countries busily
modernizing their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after they had conducted more than 2,000 tests, a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature,
following two and a half years of negotiations in which India
participated actively. This treaty, alas, was neither comprehensive
nor related to disarmament but rather devoted to ratifying the
nuclear status quo.
</P>
<P>
   India's options had narrowed critically. India had to ensure
that its nuclear option, developed and safeguarded over decades,
was not eroded by self-imposed restraint. Such a loss would place
the country at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a difficult decision, New Delhi realized that its
lone touchstone remained national security. The nuclear tests it
conducted this year on May 11 and 13 were not only inevitable but a
continuation of policies from almost the earliest years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   India's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic
tenet: that the country's national security in a world of nuclear
proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in exercise of
the principle of equal and legitimate security for all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when a free India took its rightful place in the world,
both the nuclear age and the Cold War had already dawned. Instead
of aligning with either bloc, India rejected the Cold War paradigm
and chose the more difficult path of nonalignment.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, India's foreign policy was based on its
desire to attain an alternative global balance of power that,
crucially, was structured around universal, nondiscriminatory
disarmament. Nuclear technology had already transformed global
security. Nuclear weapons, theorists reasoned, are not actually
weapons of war but, in effect, military deterrents and tools of
possible diplomatic coercion.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Indian nuclear policy, therefore, remains that a
world free of nuclear weapons would enhance not only India's
security but the security of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of universal disarmament, India could scarcely
accept a regime that arbitrarily divided nuclear haves from
have-nots. India has always insisted that all nations' security
interests are equal and legitimate. From the start, therefore, its
principles instilled a distaste for the self-identified and closed
club of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, nuclear weapons were routinely tested above
ground, making the mushroom cloud the age's symbol. Even then, when
the world had witnessed only a few dozen tests, India took the lead
in calling for an end to all nuclear-weapons testing, but the calls
of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, India's security concerns deepened. In 1962, China
attacked India on its Himalayan border. The nuclear age entered
India's neighborhood when China became a nuclear power in October
1964. From then on, no responsible Indian leader could rule out the
option of following suit.
</P>
<P>
   With no international guarantees of Indian security forthcoming,
nuclear abstinence by India alone seemed increasingly worrisome.
With the 1962 war with China very much on his mind, Indian Prime
Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri began tentatively investigating a
subterranean nuclear-explosion project.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Indian nonproliferation initiatives had scant
impact. In 1965, to make matters worse, the second war between
India and Pakistan broke out. Shastri died in 1966 and was
succeeded by Indira Gandhi, who continued the fruitless search for
international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, India reaffirmed its commitment to disarmament but
decided not to sign the NPT. In 1974, it conducted its first
nuclear test, Pokharan I.
</P>
<P>
   The first 50 years of Indian independence reveal that the
country's moralistic nuclear policy and restraint paid no
measurable dividends, except resentment at home that India was
being discriminated against. Disarmament seemed increasingly
unrealistic politics.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five's possession of nuclear weapons increases
security, why would India's possession of nuclear weapons be
dangerous? If the permanent five continue to employ nuclear weapons
as an international currency of force and power, why should India
voluntarily devalue its own state power and national security? If
deterrence works in the West _ as it so obviously appears to, since
Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear weapons _
by what reasoning will it not work in India?
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear-weapons powers continue to have, but preach to the
have-nots to have even less. India counters by suggesting either
universal, nondiscriminatory disarmament or equal security for the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11 India successfully carried out three underground
nuclear tests, followed on May 13 by two more underground,
sub-kiloton tests. These five tests, ranging from the sub-kiloton
and fission variety to a thermonuclear device, amply demonstrated
India's scientific, technical and organizational abilities, which
until then had only been vaguely suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight later, on May 28 and 30, neighboring Pakistan
predictably carried out its own tests in the bleak fastness of the
Chagai Hills in Baluchistan, near the Afghan border. Suddenly the
strategic equipoise of the post-Cold War world was rattled. The
entire nonproliferation regime and the future of disarmament were
at the forefront of international agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, India has consistently advocated global
nuclear disarmament, convinced that a world without nuclear weapons
will enhance both global and Indian security.
</P>
<P>
   India was the first to call for a ban on nuclear testing in
1954, for a nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation in 1965,
for a treaty on nonuse of nuclear weapons in 1978, for a nuclear
freeze in 1982, and for a phased program for complete elimination
of nuclear weapons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of these initiatives were rejected by the
nuclear-weapons states, who still consider these weapons essential
for their own security. What emerged, in consequence, has been a
discriminatory and flawed nonproliferation regime that damages
India's security.
</P>
<P>
   For years India conveyed its apprehensions to other countries,
but this did not improve its security environment. This disharmony
and disjunction between global thought and trends in Indian thought
about nuclear weapons is, unfortunately, the objective reality of
the world. Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power.
</P>
<P>
   India could have lived with a nuclear option but without overt
weaponization in a world where nuclear weapons had not been
formally legitimized. That course was no longer viable in the
post-1995 world of legitimized nuclear weapons. What's more, the
Sino-Pakistani nuclear weapons collaboration _ a flagrant violation
of the NPT _ made it obvious that the NPT regime had collapsed in
India's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations on the CTBT in 1996, India for the first time
stated that the nuclear issue is a national-security concern for
India and advanced that as one reason why India was unable to
accede to the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this persuaded the nuclear hegemons to introduce a
clause at the last minute pressing India, along with 43 other
nations, to sign the treaty to bring it into force. This coercive
clause violates the Vienna Convention on Treaties, which stipulates
that a nation not willing to be a party to a treaty cannot have
obligations arising out of that treaty imposed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Even more galling, this clause was introduced at the insistence
of China _ the provider of nuclear technology to Pakistan. When the
international community approved the coercive CTBT, India's
security environment deteriorated significantly. India's plight
worsened as the decade wore on. In 1997 more evidence surfaced on
the proliferation between China and Pakistan and about U.S.
permissiveness on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
Washington, the United States insisted on a separate agreement with
China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan, which the
Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence. Both the U.S.
unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as
a threat to India's security.
</P>
<P>
   After all these assurances, China continued to pass missile
technology and components to Pakistan. Despite this, the Clinton
administration was still willing to certify that China was not
proliferating or _ even worse for India _ that the United States
was either unable or unwilling to restrain China.
</P>
<P>
   As the range of options for India narrowed, so too did the
problems of taking corrective action. The tests of May 11 and 13
were not directed against any country. They were intended to
reassure the people of India about their own security.
Confidence-building is a continuous process to which India remains
committed.
</P>
<P>
   India's motive remains security, not, as some have speciously
charged, domestic politics. Had the tests been motivated simply by
electoral exigencies, there would have been no need to test the
range of technologies and yields demonstrated in May. In the
marketplace of Indian public life, a simple low-yield device would
have sufficed. Since that marketplace did not govern the decision
to experiment, the tests encompassed the range of technologies
necessary to make a credible nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   India is now a nuclear weapons state, as is Pakistan. That
reality can neither be denied nor wished away. India's strengthened
nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility _ the
obligation of power. India, mindful of its international duties, is
committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to
mount threats against any country. These are weapons of
self-defense, to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   India remains committed to the basic tenet of its foreign policy
_ a conviction that global elimination of nuclear weapons will
enhance its security as well as that of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the tests, India stated that it will henceforth
observe a voluntary moratorium and refrain from conducting
underground nuclear test explosions. The basic obligation of the
CTBT is thus met: to undertake no more nuclear tests. Since India
already subscribes to the substance of the test-ban treaty, all
that remains is its actual signature.
</P>
<P>
   India has also expressed readiness to participate in
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a
fissile material cut-off treaty. Its basic objective is to prohibit
future production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   India's approach in these negotiations will be to ensure that
this treaty is universal, nondiscriminatory and backed by an
effective verification mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War did not result in the end of history.
The great thaw that began in the late 1980s only melted down the
ancient animosities of Europe. We have not entered a unipolar
order. India still lives in a rough neighborhood. It would be a
great error to assume that simply advocating the new mantras of
globalization and the market serves to make national security
subservient to global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will not be the century of trade. The world
still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries.

   LOS ANGELES _ ``First Love, Last Rites'' strives to be a
realistic depiction of teen-age love's consuming passions and
devouring fears. But despite its low-key character interaction and
deliberate, observational atmosphere, it still comes off as
mannered and unnecessarily symbolic.

<P>
   Mildly eccentric behavior is nicely limned by Natasha Gregson
Wagner as a sex-loving Louisiana lass and Robert John Burke as her
loser/dreamer daddy.
</P>
<P>
   But the main character, Giovanni Ribisi's vacationing New Yorker
Joey, is an annoying little twit. He spends his time either
too-earnestly helping Burke's Henry pursue ridiculous moneymaking
schemes or hectoring Wagner's Sissel about their physically
satisfying but emotionally shaky relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This is Joey's first exposure to intimacy and, it's indicated,
Sissel's a little more experienced. We all know how easy it is to
act like an idiot at such a key juncture in your life; still, a
movie about a guy making nothing but the wrong moves, then
passively whining about it, gets old fast.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an Ian McEwan short story, the film has been removed
from a British industrial town to a sleepy bayou fishing community
by first-time feature director Jesse Peretz. Though a music-video
veteran, Peretz goes for a leisurely, conversation- and
performance-based style here. If the characters were more
intriguing or had more interesting things to say, this might have
been a good strategy. In this case, though, it slows already pokey
pacing to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the, uh, artsy stuff. Sissel and Joey shack up
in a smelly one-room apartment, where she plays _ when she gets
uneasy _ 45-rpm vinyl records of pop hits you've never heard before
(though the story presumably takes place in the CD '90s).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's a rat in the wall that stands for the forces
slowly eating away at their love. Similarly, Joey and Henry's
doomed eel-catching venture lets us know that for these folks, the
future is a slippery, probably hopeless proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh.
</P>
<P>
   At least the lovemaking scenes are good, maybe because they
aren't as burdened with misjudged metaphorical weight. When you
boil it all down, ``First Love, Last Rites'' is really just about
two kids who don't have anything between them except sexual
compatibility. Though they might think their problems are the
tragic stuff of high art, we all know that, once they fully grow
up, they'll probably remember each other fondly, if not very often.
</P>
<P>
   Which is still more of an impression than this slight but
self-serious movie will leave.

PURE DE PALMA _ AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new Brian De Palma movie is always a cause for
celebration and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Cineastes and suspense lovers alike know they can look forward
to shocking plot twists, outlandish-yet-accomplished homages to
great films of the past and virtuoso visual techniques. But they
also know that he sometimes opts for an incoherent commercial
production to keep his stock high with Hollywood studios, which
results in muddled messes like ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and
``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those who don't appreciate De Palma's
compositional gifts and outrageous imagery wish he'd stick to nice,
accessibly brutal entertainments like ``The Untouchables'' and
``Carrie,'' and leave the electric drills (``Body Double''), rape
abductions (``Casualties of War'') and homicidal transvestites
(``Dressed to Kill,'' ``Raising Cain'') well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   His new thriller, ``Snake Eyes,'' finds De Palma trying to
satisfy both audience segments. It's relatively restrained _ for De
Palma _ on the gory graphics and violence against women fronts
(this time, he lost a fight with the MPAA to get a PG-13 rating
rather than an R, as opposed to his usual struggles to dodge X's
and NC-17's). But it also boasts some of De Palma's most
spectacular formal flourishes, beginning with the most complicated,
20-minute Steadicam shot in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has a protagonist as unsympathetic as any in the De
Palma canon and a story line that preview audiences are finding
hard to swallow. Nicolas Cage plays Rick Santoro, a corrupt,
over-the-top Atlantic City cop who finds himself embroiled in the
assassination of a high-level government official. He then has to
locate his long-lost decency while investigating the mystery, which
involves his unlikely best friend (Gary Sinise's navy commander
Kevin Dunne), takes place at a championship prizefight and
incorporates a hurricane approaching the packed arena.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the plot (by David Koepp, a writer on De Palma's
``Mission: Impossible'' and ``Carlito's Way'') will prove a bit
excessive for some tastes. But with this director, something has to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had extreme harsh criticisms; anyone who can survive
`Bonfire of the Vanities' and still be here is kind of a miracle in
itself, not to mention `Body Double,''' De Palma notes in his usual
blunt manner. ``But, basically, I have to make the movies that I
think are right. The ideas or stories or emotions have to stir me,
and if nobody agrees with me ... Too bad!''
</P>
<P>
   He admits lavishing more attention on ``Snake Eyes'' staging and
high-tech electronics jokes (another favorite De Palma motif that's
popped up in ``Mission,'' ``Blow Out,'' ``Dressed to Kill'' and
others) than on, perhaps, molding a waterproof narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like suspense movies because they're visual, and I think you
see very few directors working visually today,'' De Palma says. ``I
do tend to focus on the visual image more than the story in many
films. It's a big, white canvas up there _ what are you filling it
with? Closeups of people talking? I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough as he sounds, De Palma is enough of a craftsman to try to
tell the best story he can by whatever means necessary _ indeed,
Koepp wrote ``Snake Eyes'' from the director's original idea.
</P>
<P>
   And it should not be forgotten that he gave no less an actor
than Robert De Niro his start in movies with the 1968 ``Greetings''
and the 1970 ``Hi, Mom!'' He also directed Sean Connery to an
Academy Award in ``The Untouchables,'' and elicited some of the
best performances of their careers from Al Pacino (``Scarface,''
``Carlito's''), Sean Penn (``Casualties''), Sissy Spacek
(``Carrie'') and John Travolta (``Blow Out'').
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really equally devoted to both camera and his actors,''
says Cage, an Oscar winner (``Leaving Las Vegas'') known for taking
enormous risks with his performances. ``Brian loves actors, so you
get that sense that you can trust him. I felt like I could really
go for it with this character, take chances and get kind of wild,
and that he would use the right takes. I've always been a huge fan
of Brian's, and I felt safe with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``De Palma's an artist, so he's always going to do something
interesting,'' adds highly respected stage, screen and television
actor Sinise. ``Sometimes it's going to work better than others,
but there's always some kind of strong vision there. That always
gives an actor a sense of confidence; you want to be following
somebody who has a real point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Never more so than in that opening traveling shot, which begins
with a TV news report on the stormy Boardwalk, then shifts inside
the packed Atlantic City Arena (actually, the old Montreal Forum,
which was restocked with up to 14,000 extras, many of them diehard
Canadiens fans who were stoked to be back in their old sports
shrine). It follows Santoro as he weaves through the throngs, bets
with bookies, roughs up gangsters, talks to his wife on one cell
phone line and his girlfriend on another, and generally reveals his
entire character while leading a tour of the massive, teeming
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``These extremely long takes would go on and on and on, with
mountains of dialogue,'' Cage recalls of the eye-popping shot,
which was filmed in complexly choreographed, five-minute intervals.
``There was so much adrenaline going on in these takes; we knew we
were doing something exciting. But when you're moving and talking
that fast and the camera's going with you and all of those people
are there, you get into this buzz that's undeniable. You can't
really think, you're like an animal moving and talking on instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does create a certain mania,'' Cage adds with a smile.
``Good thing I trusted Brian De Palma to use material that would
not embarrass me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of faith. De Palma admits that getting everything
to work on cue for the Steadicam shot was a challenge even for
someone of his formidable formal prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how everything is supposed to be, but you're trying
to get through it and keep everyone else lively and up,'' the
director says. ``That's especially hard when you're doing stuff
that's frenetic, because people get tired if they keep repeating it
and you don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in those Steadicam shots, so much stuff happens that you
can't predict, and you have to adjust the shot for that. The
cameraman can't get to a certain position, you've got crossing crew
people running into each other, you've got extras having to be
moved from one place to another _ it's a very complicated logistics
problem. But it's also a lot of fun to shoot those scenes, like a
high-wire act without a net. It's very exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Once things calm down after the, um, blowout establishing shot,
De Palma's trademark cynicism kicks in. Meanwhile, Santoro tries to
piece together the plot behind the crime via a complicated series
of flashbacks from conflicting witnesses' points of view and taped
footage from surveillance cameras placed all around the arena.
</P>
<P>
   It connects crime, conspiracy and deceptive/revealing imagery in
a way that is pure De Palma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff has always interested me, and it's been in a lot of
my movies,'' the filmmaker says. ``I've always kept up with what's
going on on the political scene, read all the assassination books,
and the influence of the media has always fascinated me because
it's become a really huge thing through my lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can get cynical enough anymore. It's
incredible; when I watch what goes on on television, I say, `This
is unbelievable.' For everything, there's a left view and a right
view. Nothing's truth anymore, there's just a version of the spin.
How did we get like that? The camera lies all the time, and we see
it on television constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another incendiary statement, especially from a guy who's used
his mastery of cinematic technique to manipulate, appall and
mesmerize audience like nobody else in his image-inundated
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're filmmakers,'' De Palma retorts with a rare, yet
appropriately sardonic, laugh. ``We're fiction-makers. We're not
pretending to tell the truth.''

`SNAKE EYES' COMES UP LESS THAN A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just a few minutes into ``Snake Eyes,'' you know
you're watching a Brian De Palma movie (and how many directors can
you say that about?) as the camera seamlessly follows Nicolas Cage
through an Atlantic City arena, twisting through corridors,
climbing stairs, hopping onto an escalator and finally landing on
the floor of the arena in the middle of all the hoopla and bedlam
surrounding a heavyweight prize fight. It's a brilliantly realized,
20-minute steadicam shot that crackles with more electricity than
10,000 of Michael Bay's three-second quick cuts put together.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, by the time ``Snake Eyes'' is over, you also know
you've been watching a Brian De Palma movie because with the
signature visuals and the innovative camera work come the usual
excesses and incongruous moments. You leave the theater a
dissatisfied customer. Again.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma has amassed an incredible body of work containing
flawed, yet memorable movies. He is as frustrating as a career
politician, typically promising more than he can ever deliver _ and
yet actors, studios and audiences keep coming back. Why? For those
moments when he lives up to his word. (Remember Tom Cruise's
high-wire act in ``Mission: Impossible''? We thought so.)
</P>
<P>
   The memorable segments in ``Snake Eyes'' come in chunks,
starting with the 20-minute opening sequence that introduces us to
Cage's gleefully corrupt police detective, Rick Santoro, as he
shakes down thugs for gambling money, hits on ring girls and
proclaims to any and all, ``This is my SEWER! I was MADE for this
SEWER!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Santoro is there ostensibly to help provide protection for the
U.S. Secretary of Defense and his menagerie of friends. Leading the
security contingent is Santoro's old college buddy, Navy Cmdr.
Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), now a highly placed Defense Department
staffer. The secretary likes the limelight, much to Dunne's dismay.
Protecting him in this crazy environment is akin to safeguarding a
beer keg at a frat party.
</P>
<P>
   It's not giving too much away to say that shots ring out and
something bad happens. It's also not giving too much away (if
you're familiar with De Palma's work), to reveal that there's a
shapely woman wearing a platinum-blond wig and a low-cut dress
(Carla Gugino) who may or may not be involved in the bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, we don't know what to think. (And isn't that nice,
since we're typically two steps ahead of the filmmaker.) De Palma,
through Cage's Santoro, then begins piecing the murder together for
the audience, using the point-of-view from three witnesses _ the
champion boxer, the mysterious woman and Dunne himself. The answers
Santoro finds aren't quite as obvious as he first thought, which
forces him to confront his past and the kind of crooked cop he has
become.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But as the details of the crime become more
apparent, the story _ a bit threadbare to begin with _ begins to
unravel with alarming speed, culminating with an ending that shoots
the whole ball of yarn. It's a conclusion that's woefully
inadequate both artistically and emotionally, not to mention
somewhat ludicrous even by popcorn movie standards.
</P>
<P>
   After the thud of that dud (and a pointless end titles
sequence), you're left with fond memories of the virtuoso opening
and a later sequence where Dunne searches a hotel floor as the
camera slowly pans over the ceiling of each room, revealing
assorted sordid activities. There's also the enjoyable turn by
Cage, always more fun in volcanic mode (``Face/Off,'' ``Leaving Las
Vegas'') than when he's playing an earnest nice guy (``Face/Off,''
``City of Angels'').
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the balances on the enjoyment ledger are pretty equally
divided. And even though ``Snake Eyes'' is rated R, De Palma has
graciously ratcheted down his trademark gore. (Slow-motion bullet
wounds, yes; drill bits through torsos, no.)
</P>
<P>
   The choice, then, is to go for De Palma's golden moments and
Cage's audacious performance and ignore the rest (hey, it's more
than most movies offer) or take a pass, wait six months and make a
trip to the video store. The latter course may be the most prudent.
After all, De Palma makes the kind of movies that lend themselves
nicely to fast-forward and rewind options.

WELL-DRAWN CHARACTERS ENHANCE QUIRKY `SAFE MEN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are a couple of dim bulbs at the center of
the engagingly offbeat comedy ``Safe Men,'' but unlike the recent
dimwit duos of ``BASEketball'' or ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (and its
countless rip-offs), these guys mind their manners. One of them
even wangles an invitation to a Rosh Hashanah barbecue and _ get
this _ never once passes gas or lets out a belch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Men'' has quirkier ambitions. First-time writer-director
John Hamburg offers sly winks to a wide variety of sources _ Woody
Allen, ``Star Wars,'' ``Say Anything'' among them _ to create a
charming, warm and, yes, funny movie debut. It's not a film that's
going to provoke tears of laughter (there's no ``hair-gel''
clincher a la ``There's Something About Mary''), but it won't
prompt too many groans, either. (See previous ``hair gel''
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Men'' has a pair of couples. There are the two
professional safe crackers, Mitchell and Frank (Josh Pais and Mark
Ruffalo), who are methodically making their way through every
strongbox in Providence, R.I. And then there are Sam and Eddie (Sam
Rockwell and Steve Zahn), two horrific tin-eared singers who
periodically don sweater vests and butcher folk tunes at local
restaurants. (Part of their problem: Sam can't remember lyrics,
prompting one of the film's funniest scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   On their way home from another odious gig, Sam and Eddie are
mistakenly identified as the expert safecrackers. Soon they find
themselves before Big Fat Bernie Gayle (Michael Lerner), mob leader
of the ``Jewish Mafia.'' Big Fat Bernie demands that they pull
three heists for him, including one at the very tabernacle where
his son, Little Big Fat Bernie, will be having his bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Safe Men'' has underworld figures and petty
criminals, the film is not another example of scuzz cinema. There's
no blood, only bluster. And while Hamburg shows the occasional sign
of coming down with a mild case of Tarantino Blather, the pop
cultural references always take a back seat to the film's
well-drawn characters.
</P>
<P>
   And what characters they are. In addition to Big Fat Bernie,
there's a rival Jewish crime lord, Good Stuff Leo (Harvey
Fierstein), whose daughter, Hannah (Christina Kirk), falls for Sam.
(She has a thing for thieves.)
</P>
<P>
   Big Fat Bernie and Little Big Fat Bernie share a love of hockey
and sweat suits, which they have custom made by tailors who come
straight to Big Fat's house. Big Fat is a model dad, and his
detailed planning of Little Fat's bar mitzvah (or bee-mitzvah, as
he calls it) is priceless. Imagine the introductions of a Chicago
Bulls playoff game and you'll get the idea of the bee-mitzvah's
party-down atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is full of wonderful moments and winning performances.
Zahn, the stoned scene-stealer from ``Out of Sight,'' here displays
the same winsome charm, while Rockwell has a shy sweetness,
particularly in his scenes with Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Every character has either a great line or a remarkable scene,
such as when Fierstein's Good Stuff Leo recounts the time when some
slacks he fenced turned out to be a little too hot for everyone
concerned. You won't forget it or this movie. Hopefully, we'll be
hearing more from its creator in the near future.

U.S. JUDGE ORDERS MINISTER TO FACE WAR CRIMES COURT

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A federal judge has ruled that a Seventh-day
Adventist minister should be turned over to a United Nations war
crimes tribunal on charges he helped slaughter people who took
refuge in his church during Rwanda's civil strife in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey's decision marks the latest
round in a two-year legal battle and is the first time in history
that a person arrested on U.S. soil would be handed over to a U.N.
tribunal, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 74, was taken to the Webb County Jail
after he was arrested at his son's home in Laredo on Wednesday.
Ntakirutimana, who is from Rwanda, has repeatedly denied any role
in the ethnic bloodshed that occurred in the Central African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The war crimes tribunal, based in Tanzania, has accused
Ntakirutimana of leading attackers armed with machetes, grenades
and guns in a murderous April 1994 rampage that killed dozens of
people who were hiding in the church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana, a
Hutu, also is charged with being a fugitive of a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   He suffers from a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at U.N. headquarters in New York welcomed the
court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a step forward in ending impunity by bringing
those responsible for tragedy to court,'' Jessica Jiji said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is representing
Ntakirutimana, was given 30 days to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has questioned the legality of the war crimes tribunal and
said that Ntakirutimana was a religious man who was being framed by
tribal hatred in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man's family has said he's being persecuted by
members of the new government in Rwanda who resented his ethnicity
and his power as a minister in the 265,000-member Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle said Ntakirutimana would
be held until the judge orders marshals to hand the man over to the
State Department, which would transfer him to the Tanzania-based
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as his actual guilt or innocence, that's up to the
tribunal to decide,'' DeGabrielle said.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana faces up to life in prison, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rainey's 61-page ruling pushes aside a federal magistrate's
December 1997 decision that Ntakirutimana should not be turned over
to the tribunal because his arrest violated the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal filed to Rainey, prosecutors had said U.S.
Magistrate Judge Marcel Notzon's decision was an ``embarrassment''
to the U.S. government and threatened to harm future efforts to get
countries to turn over suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Jiji said the tribunal expects to issue its first two sentences
in the next few weeks after the recent convictions of Rwanda's
former interim prime minister and a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana had spent 15 months behind bars until Notzon ruled
he be freed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. tribunal has a dozen witnesses who supposedly would
testify at the trial of Ntakirutimana, but their identities are
being kept secret, according to court documents.

EXPERTS ADVISE A GO-SLOW APPROACH IN TALKING ABOUT WAR STORIES

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the critically acclaimed
film by Steven Spielberg about World War II, has been a catalyst
for people seeking to learn more from veterans who saw combat.
</P>
<P>
   For those veterans, however, the subject can be fraught with
painful and emotional memories. So can watching the movie,
particularly the carnage depicted in the film's opening 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans hospitals reportedly have been inundated with calls
from veterans seeking help in dealing with disturbing memories
prompted by the film's realism.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reflection of why approaching veterans to talk about
their war experiences needs to be done with sensitivity, mental
health professionals say.
</P>
<P>
   James Garrett, clinical psychologist for the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in Albany, said he and his colleagues at the center
were encouraging family members to ask veterans about the war but
to do so with care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are classic questions you can ask that we use with
veterans,'' said Garrett, who is a Vietnam veteran. ``Such as,
`What did you do in the war?' `Where did you serve?' `What was your
job?' `When were you there?' Those are lead questions to start a
conversation. Give them the opportunity to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that everyone experiences traumatic events such as
war differently, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can go to war and be changed in the same way. They see
and do things that most people have no concept of. Therefore, if
they choose not to talk and answer even the most basic questions,
switch gears and change to a different subject,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, veterans would rather talk with groups of other
veterans, where there's an understanding of what happened between
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Jankowski, a clinical social worker and director of
the Mental Health Clinic at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Albany, said it was important to not probe or pressure an unwilling
veteran into talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do want to talk, always start out with general
fact-sharing questions to bring the conversation into perspective
for the veteran,'' Jankowski said. ``Sometimes they may just want
to share what the customs or politics were like in a country.
That's a way to initiate the conversation, rather than asking a
more emotional question. It's always better to allow the person to
say what they want to say and not what they are not ready to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Duncan, clinical manager of community-based veterans
clinics for the veterans hospital in Albany, said most people who
have never been in a war don't have a clue of what one is asked to
do in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``War is brutal,'' Duncan stressed. ``Many of the veterans were
ill-prepared to handle such horrific situations, let alone just the
sheer stress of being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie will bring back many memories, especially to those
who have suppressed them over the years. Don't forget that many men
and women came home from wars with no closure or recognition,
especially from Vietnam. No one wanted to hear about what they went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankowski said that under the right circumstances it can be
healthy, even cathartic, for veterans to talk about their war
experiences. Not being able to do so can also take its toll on some
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying secrets around isn't healthy for anyone,'' he said.
``Holding these traumatic images in has caused many veterans to
become depressed, have sleepless nights or ongoing nightmares over
the years, or to vent in other ways, such as turning to drugs,
alcohol and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans often don't talk about their experiences with their
spouses, because they realize that they don't understand the
trauma,'' Jankowski said.

   1. STUDY FINDS INCREASE IN BIRTH DEFECTS NEAR HAZARDOUS WASTE
SITES Women living within 3 kilometers of hazardous waste landfills
had a ``small but significant'' increased risk of giving birth to
children with birth defects, according to a new study. The defects
included neural tube abnormalities and malformations of the heart,
aorta and the great veins entering the heart. Although the results
do not prove that the increase in birth defects was caused by
exposure to toxins from the landfills, the results are worrying and
more study is needed. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service.

_EXERCISE MAY NOT CUT RISK OF BREAST CANCER   
 _FOR ATHLETES-TO-BE, A CALL FOR HEART TESTS   
 _OPHTHALMOLOGISTS BACK USE OF AIR BAGS  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Exercise may not cut risk of breast cancer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new report deals a blow to the hope that strenuous exercise,
particularly in adolescence, could reduce women's risk of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That notion had gained support from studies that found a
protective effect of exercise. The hypothesis is that exercise
reduces a woman's exposure to estrogen by delaying the onset of
menstruation and making menstrual cycles longer.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study II, which
appears in the current Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
did not find any link between a woman's self-reported history of
exercise and her risk of breast cancer. Data from 104,468 women who
were aged 25 to 42 when they entered the study in 1989 showed no
difference in breast cancer risk between those who had engaged in
strenuous activity at least twice a week or more most of the year
during adolescence and those who had not done strenuous workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there an association between strenuous activity in more
recent years and breast cancer risk, found the authors, headed by
Beverly Rockhill at the Channing Laboratory of Brigham and Women's
Hospital, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Joanne F. Dorgan of the National
Cancer Institute noted that physical activity is one of the few
potentially modifiable breast cancer risk factors, and that more
study on the possible link is needed. However, she wrote, ``given
the current evidence, recommendations to premenopausal women to
increase their physical activity with the specific aim of
preventing breast cancer would be premature.''
</P>
<P>
   But for postmenopausal women, in whom obesity is a breast cancer
risk factor, recommending physical activity to remain trim is
reasonable, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; For athletes-to-be, a call for heart tests
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thorough heart checkups of young athletes before they begin
competing in sports can prevent many of the sudden deaths that now
occur, according to a new study from Italy. But US heart
specialists say such a comprehensive program is not likely in this
country because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has required precompetition heart screening for the past
20 years, and the government pays the bills. In the current issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine, physicians from the
University of Padua and the Italian National Health Service report
on screening tests of 33,735 young athletes from 1979 to 1996 in
the Veneto region of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, including taking family histories and administering
an electrocardiogram, led to disqualifying 22 athletes because of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease that is a
common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. As a result,
only one sudden death from that disease occurred in the remaining
athletes over the period, while there were 16 sudden deaths from
the disease in nonathletes who hadn't been screened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the power of a comprehensive screening program,''
said Dr. Barry Maron of the Minneapolis Heart Institute, and
chairman of an American Heart Association panel that drew up
guidelines for athlete screening. He said screening in the United
States varies widely on a state-to-state basis, and that a
government-funded effort is unlikely here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Ophthalmologists back use of air bags
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have only one good eye, you should keep your auto
air bags connected rather than disable them for fear of an ocular
injury, specialists say, making a strong argument against
disconnecting the safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology issued the statement this
week after one of its members was asked by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration whether there were vision-related
reasons to fear accidental air bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air bag is more likely to prevent than to cause serious
ocular injury,'' said Dr. Dante Pieramici, the academy member.
``Overall, the life-saving benefits of air bags far outweigh the
risk of ocular injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Air bags have caused eye injuries ranging from bruises to
eyeball ruptures to blindness, but have saved more than 2,500 lives
since 1987, the academy statement pointed out.

MOB WITNESS SAYS HE WAS `TRAPPED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a secret that mob soldier Angelo ``Sonny''
Mercurio was willing to go to prison to keep: He did not want the
world, particularly the underworld, to know he was an FBI
informant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there he was Wednesday, reluctantly testifying in federal
court in Boston for a second day about how he helped the FBI pull
off a major law enforcement coup, the 1989 bugging of a Mafia
baptism ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was giving them information, I was a stool pigeon,'' said
Mercurio, 62, as he sat in the witness box staring across the
courtroom at the defendants in a federal racketeering case: reputed
mob boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi and Robert DeLuca.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange series of events that put Mercurio on the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Flemmi and fugitive South Boston crime boss James
``Whitey'' Bulger _ both valued informants _ told FBI Special Agent
John Connolly that Mercurio's restaurant in Boston's Prudential
Center was a new mob hangout.
</P>
<P>
   A bug planted inside Vanessa's Italian Food Shop captured
Mercurio and several cohorts shaking down two elderly bookmakers
for $500,000 and talking about their sports betting operation.
</P>
<P>
   Agents &UR;  &LR; raided the restaurant and Mercurio's Malden home in
1987, but seized only one football card. Mercurio testified
Wednesday he had ``inside information'' that the restaurant had
been bugged by the FBI and that he suspected then that the bureau
had enough evidence to eventually indict him.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of that year, Mercurio testified, he bumped into
Connolly and, while talking about the raid, boasted, ``We're
getting better information than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI was conducting a leak investigation. Later,
according to Mercurio, Connolly came back to him and said,
``Listen, we know who the guy is who is giving you information. You
help us figure who he's working through and we won't let your
friends know.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an FBI clerk was later fired for leaking confidential
information about the ongoing investigation to a local Mafioso via
her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio testified he reluctantly worked as an FBI informant for
the next two years because ``I felt trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the suggestion that Flemmi, an informant since 1965,
personally recruited him to cooperate with the FBI, Mercurio
testified, ``No, I never knew he was a stool pigeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to Mercurio, the FBI asked him if Bulger and
Flemmi were involved in drugs and he told them that as far as he
knew, ``they're like everybody else. They'll shake down a drug
dealer because they're open season.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Mercurio told the FBI that the Patriarca crime family
planned to induct four new members _ including DeLuca _ in a secret
ceremony at a Medford home on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   When pressured to wear a wire during the ceremony, Mercurio
testified, he told agents: ``I ain't testifying. I ain't wearing no
wires. Forget about it. Whatever you do, you do. If everybody gets
busted, I get busted with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But months before he was indicted on racketeering charges in
March 1990 along with 20 other mobsters, Mercurio fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure the longer you can stay away, the better you do,''
Mercurio told US District Judge Mark Wolf Wednesday. ``The guys who
stay away did better than the guys who went to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mercurio was nabbed in June 1994 in Georgia, he told the
FBI to ``burn'' his informant file, insisting he'd rather face a
lengthy prison term than reveal his cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the FBI has revealed Mercurio's informant status, Wolf
is considering a government request to reduce his nine-year prison
term.

401(K) ADVICE: STICK IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Employees of Mark-Taylor Residential will find a
little something extra in their paychecks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not more money but some words of wisdom that could pay off
in their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, the top executives of the Scottsdale, Ariz.,
apartment developer warn participants in the company's 401(k) plan
that they could see big declines in their accounts if the stock
market stays rocky but suggest that they stay focused on the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has convinced many experts that one should not panic
and sell out,'' during down times, wrote Scott Taylor, a principal
in the company, and Matt Perrin, the firm's president. ``This is
particularly important given that your 401(k) is a long-term
investment plan, which over time will not be largely affected by
the current market fluctuations.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: ``Keep an investment mix that you are
comfortable with and remember stocks go down sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message being sounded by employers, financial planners,
mutual fund companies and other investment professionals in the
wake of the stock market's recent roller coaster ride, capped by
Tuesday's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 300-point drop in the bellwether Dow Jones industrial
average left the market down 9 percent from its July highs, almost
enough to call it a correction. Wednesday was another volatile day,
but stocks finished up 59 points.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin said the company has sent out memos to its 150 employees
periodically since the red-hot stock market _ which has spoiled
many investors with annual returns as high as 30 percent the past
three years _ has cooled. This week's memo was planned even before
Tuesday's free fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be proactive and keep them informed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb Corp. employees have been getting similar reminders for
about a year, courtesy of Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund
giant that administers the home builder's 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The theme: how to handle volatile markets. The advice: Don't
freak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been saying things like, `The market corrections
occur. it doesn't mean you should sell,' '' said Gail Paul, Del
Webb's director of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   She had to sound the same themes herself Wednesday, as she was
introducing Webb's 401(k) plan to employees of a couple of Florida
housing developments that the company recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   To support their buy-and-hold recommendations for investors
saving for retirement, investment experts roll out evidence faster
then you can say ``blue-chip'':
</P>
<P>
   - After the market crash in October 1987, when stocks fell 22.6
percent in one day, the market went on to finish the year with a
small gain and was back to its previous high in 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   - If you invested $1 in the market in 1963 and didn't touch it
until 1993, it would have grown to $24. But if you were out of the
market during the 90 best trading days during those 31 years _ just
1.2 percent of the time _ you would have a mere $2.10. This is
according to a University of Michigan School of Business
Administration study widely publicized in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   - Remember the 500-point plunge last October?
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was back in record territory in February.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners say such statistics argue against so-called
market timing, or moving money out of stocks when you foresee a
fall and back in when you think they're headed up. The problem is
most investors lack the skill to time things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk people take is getting out and missing out on the
rise,'' said Susan Edwards, a certified financial planner with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   George Fraser, an assistant vice president at Piper Jaffray who
specializes in 401(k) plans for companies including Tempe-based
Insight Enterprises, is so adamant about devising an investment mix
and sticking with it that he urges employees to call him before
they move money around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single person has my direct line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `You call me, and I'll explain why you probably
shouldn't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, are people listening?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, yes, Fraser and others say.
</P>
<P>
   While they're no doubt a little concerned and have called to
check on their balances, most don't appear to be making any rash
investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wilkie, benefits administrator for Samaritan Health System,
said no employees called her office with concerns or questions
after Tuesday's 3 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto at Mark-Taylor Residential.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Harmsen, a 42-year-old accounting firm administrator,
called financial planner Blaine Vance after Tuesday's plunge. But
she didn't make any changes to her account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just wondering if there's anything that should be
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I'm not ready to retire yet, so . . . I'm
sticking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague closer to retirement, 60-year-old Rita Mason, didn't
budge, either.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's gone down like this before. If you're in it for the
long-term, you stick with it. I'm non-panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment pros chalk it up to a better-educated public.
Employees and companies have had to learn to deal with the ups and
downs of the market as 401(k) and similar plans have replaced
traditional pensions. Plans now count more than $1 trillion in
assets, compared with $675 billion in 1996, according to the
Spectrem Group research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People now have become familiar with managing risk,'' said
Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar Inc., a Boston-based financial
services research firm.
</P>
<P>
   After last fall's market drop, an investor survey that his firm
conducted found no panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They viewed that as nothing more than a blip on the screen.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ His 2,200-mile flight from wartime
atrocities in his Central American homeland carried him to this
fishing capital's pungent waterfront, where he lived quietly and
died horribly, screaming in a language few understood.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ajqui, 40, was part of a nearly invisible industrial
underground, achieving an identity in death that was inconceivable
in a life of struggle and flight and toil in a gritty blue-collar
workplace increasingly foreign to most US workers.
</P>
<P>
   He was crushed to death last week in a vat that steams and mixes
fish guts into fertilizer as his 19-year-old son, Francisco, stood
nearby _ close enough to hear his father's haunting screams in his
native Mayan tongue: ``Help me! Help me! Get me out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the most tragic thing I've ever heard of,'' said
Earl R. Chase Sr., president of the American Indian Friends
Coalition Inc. ``He came here to help protect his family. He was
doing work that most of us wouldn't do and he took it gladly. It's
dirty. It's dangerous. They're working with razor-sharp knives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when your family is starving, you do it. That's why he
jumped into that vat. He was told to clean it, and he did it with
no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   As authorities investigate, lawyers strategize, and officials of
the fish-processing plant ponder its liability, Ajqui's co-workers
and friends in a closely knit community of an estimated 2,000 Mayan
Indians here grieve a death more horrifying than they thought
possible in what they unabashedly consider a land of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so very sad,'' said Anibal, a Mayan and a friend of Ajqui,
who asked, through an interpreter that his last name not be used.
``The rest of his children are too little to work and the family is
going to be just devastated financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ajqui grew up in the Quiche region of Guatemala, part of
an estimated 80 percent of that nation's population that is
ethnically Indian, most of whom speak an indigenous language.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Ajqui's life was threatened two years ago by
members of an army engaged in a 36-year civil war that subjected
the country's Indians to massive human rights violations,
particularly in villages where they were they were suspected by the
Guatemalan military of collaborating with leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The father of four sons and two daughters concluded the only way
to protect and provide for his family was to leave them behind. He
immigrated to the United States two years ago, joined a year later
by his oldest son, Francisco. His employers knew him by his
mother's last name, Gutierrez. But he preferred his native Mayan
name, Ajqui, which carries the full flavor of a civilization that
thrived from nearly 2,000 before Christ until the Spanish conquest
in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The New Bedford that Antonio Ajqui discovered in 1996 was a
hardscrabble tableaux of tenement housing, low wages, and
transportation by bicycle. But compared with conditions at home, it
was a workingman's haven.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the waterfront of what was once the world's whaling
capital in the 18th century is a collection of red-brick plastic
factories, grimy marine terminals, and processing plants which
package and sell fish around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui was a temporary worker, sent by his bosses to firms around
the city which needed fast help at a modest price. For the last two
months, he and his son worked at Atlantic Coast Fisheries, a
yellow-and-tan corrugated steel building surrounded by a chain-link
fence topped with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at packing houses here were represented by a seafood
workers union until the late 1980s. Wages at the houses declined
after the unions were busted, and the face of a historically
evolving workforce changed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish industry is going through a transition,'' said Harvey
Mickelson, a New Bedford attorney who has represented many
waterfront firms over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more mechanized and it's based on product being
processed and value added to it,'' he said. ``It's become an
industry that distributes frozen and finished product throughout
the world. The size of the plant that this gentleman was in would
not have been in existence 20 or 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday Atlantic Coast Fisheries, located just off a
boulevard named for Herman Melville, author of ``Moby Dick,'' was
running at full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 200 people who process fish for sale in the
US and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-morning, Ajqui and a co-worker were undertaking the daily
cleaning of a 10-by-20-foot vat whose rotating bars helped mix the
fish parts. Officials said that when Ajqui yanked on a hose he was
using, it snared the machinery's on switch and started it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he pulled the hose, it pulled the switch and it
started,'' a plant supervisor told the New Bedford Standard-Times.
``It got the foot and rolled him around in it.'' The local
newspaper said workers reported that there was no sign posted
instructing employees to disable the machine's power source before
the vat is cleaned, and that supervisors did not make that
procedure clear.
</P>
<P>
   Gary W. Orlacchio, a Boston attorney representing the Ajqui
family, said death, attributed to crushing injuries to the abdomen,
did not come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got shredded from the waist down,'' Orlacchio said. ``I
can't think of a more horrible way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney's office
said Wednesday it had completed its probe without filing criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating. The plant was fined $1,200 in 1989 for 10 violations
of the safety code, four of them serious. It was fined $5,000 in
1992 for 15 violations, 13 of them serious, including a citation
for failure to adopt procedures to ensure that machinery could not
be turned on while it is being maintained. The plant has been
operated under new ownership since last March. Officials there
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to interpret this any other way than to say
it's terribly insensitive to have a working population that is not
familiar with the language exposed to hazardous conditions and not
make darn sure that at least the OSHA requirements are being met,''
said Harry R. Carreiro, an outreach specialist with the Greater New
Bedford Fishermen's Family Emergency Center. ``Whether he forgot to
do it or should have done it, you can't hold the victim
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui's son was not available for comment. Friends said he was
receiving counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are preparing a workers' compensation case that could be
settled quickly. A a civil suit could take years. Asked what
damages he might seek from a jury, Orlacchio said, ``A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui's body was being prepared at a funeral home for its return
to Guatemala on a flight Thursday. Atlantic Coast Fisheries,
Orlacchio said, is paying the air fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most horrible thing that can happen,'' said
Mickelson. ``You're trying to do better for your family. Your son
is with you. You're working under not the best conditions and you
end up in a situation where your family will suffer for the rest of
their lives. A tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Donations to a fund established to help the Ajqui family may be
sent to the American Indian Friends Coalition, P.O. Box 50165, New
Bedford, Mass., 02745.)

401(K) ADVICE: STICK IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Employees of Mark-Taylor Residential will find a
little something extra in their paychecks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not more money but some words of wisdom that could pay off
in their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, the top executives of the Scottsdale, Ariz.,
apartment developer warn participants in the company's 401(k) plan
that they could see big declines in their accounts if the stock
market stays rocky but suggest that they stay focused on the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has convinced many experts that one should not panic
and sell out,'' during down times, wrote Scott Taylor, a principal
in the company, and Matt Perrin, the firm's president. ``This is
particularly important given that your 401(k) is a long-term
investment plan, which over time will not be largely affected by
the current market fluctuations.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: ``Keep an investment mix that you are
comfortable with and remember stocks go down sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message being sounded by employers, financial planners,
mutual fund companies and other investment professionals in the
wake of the stock market's recent roller coaster ride, capped by
Tuesday's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 300-point drop in the bellwether Dow Jones industrial
average left the market down 9 percent from its July highs, almost
enough to call it a correction. Wednesday was another volatile day,
but stocks finished up 59 points.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin said the company has sent out memos to its 150 employees
periodically since the red-hot stock market _ which has spoiled
many investors with annual returns as high as 30 percent the past
three years _ has cooled. This week's memo was planned even before
Tuesday's free fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be proactive and keep them informed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb Corp. employees have been getting similar reminders for
about a year, courtesy of Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund
giant that administers the home builder's 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The theme: how to handle volatile markets. The advice: Don't
freak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been saying things like, `The market corrections
occur. it doesn't mean you should sell,' '' said Gail Paul, Del
Webb's director of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   She had to sound the same themes herself Wednesday, as she was
introducing Webb's 401(k) plan to employees of a couple of Florida
housing developments that the company recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   To support their buy-and-hold recommendations for investors
saving for retirement, investment experts roll out evidence faster
then you can say ``blue-chip'':
</P>
<P>
   - After the market crash in October 1987, when stocks fell 22.6
percent in one day, the market went on to finish the year with a
small gain and was back to its previous high in 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   - If you invested $1 in the market in 1963 and didn't touch it
until 1993, it would have grown to $24. But if you were out of the
market during the 90 best trading days during those 31 years _ just
1.2 percent of the time _ you would have a mere $2.10. This is
according to a University of Michigan School of Business
Administration study widely publicized in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   - Remember the 500-point plunge last October?
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was back in record territory in February.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners say such statistics argue against so-called
market timing, or moving money out of stocks when you foresee a
fall and back in when you think they're headed up. The problem is
most investors lack the skill to time things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk people take is getting out and missing out on the
rise,'' said Susan Edwards, a certified financial planner with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   George Fraser, an assistant vice president at Piper Jaffray who
specializes in 401(k) plans for companies including Tempe-based
Insight Enterprises, is so adamant about devising an investment mix
and sticking with it that he urges employees to call him before
they move money around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single person has my direct line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `You call me, and I'll explain why you probably
shouldn't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, are people listening?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, yes, Fraser and others say.
</P>
<P>
   While they're no doubt a little concerned and have called to
check on their balances, most don't appear to be making any rash
investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wilkie, benefits administrator for Samaritan Health System,
said no employees called her office with concerns or questions
after Tuesday's 3 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto at Mark-Taylor Residential.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Harmsen, a 42-year-old accounting firm administrator,
called financial planner Blaine Vance after Tuesday's plunge. But
she didn't make any changes to her account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just wondering if there's anything that should be
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I'm not ready to retire yet, so . . . I'm
sticking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague closer to retirement, 60-year-old Rita Mason, didn't
budge, either.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's gone down like this before. If you're in it for the
long-term, you stick with it. I'm non-panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment pros chalk it up to a better-educated public.
Employees and companies have had to learn to deal with the ups and
downs of the market as 401(k) and similar plans have replaced
traditional pensions. Plans now count more than $1 trillion in
assets, compared with $675 billion in 1996, according to the
Spectrem Group research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People now have become familiar with managing risk,'' said
Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar Inc., a Boston-based financial
services research firm.
</P>
<P>
   After last fall's market drop, an investor survey that his firm
conducted found no panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They viewed that as nothing more than a blip on the screen.'' &QL;

HURRY-UP OFFENSE IS MANDATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ In earlier times, times of potential rather
than necessity, it might have seemed ludicrous for Pete Carroll to
give Drew Bledsoe and his offensive mates this kind of message
after one quarter of ugly exhibition football _ you're going to
play the next game until you get it right.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these were the Patriots, the offensive machine. After
all, this was Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback with the golden arm. If
there were questions about the Patriots, they were seldom about
passing the football.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe Tuesday ended his weekly 15-minute media gabfest
with a half-joke: ``I expect us to be sharp this Sunday when we
play the Vikings. I expect our passing game to be efficient this
Sunday. If it's not, I'll be very disappointed and we'll stay and
play until it is sharp. Heh-heh, you may see us play the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the starters will play ``until we get something
done ... and I don't know how many plays that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive starters seemed completely out of rhythm last
Sunday in San Francisco. Ordinarily, that is merely a wrinkle to
iron out in later exhibition games, but New England needs at least
one part of its offense _ passing _ to become reliable quickly
because the other half _ running _ has so many questions. And the
sooner the passing game finds a rhythm, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously aren't at the point where we want to be,'' said
Bledsoe, ``but we are going to be there by the time we play these
next four games.''
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary times, such talk of finding passing rhythm one week
into August would seem silly. For one thing, teams generally have
only a skeleton of a game plan, if that, for their first
exhibition, and if the opposing defense does something unexpected,
there is little in the miniature game plan to call upon. Bledsoe
said this generally was what happened in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Niners did, and what they obviously have been working
on in their camp, was some cover two where they walk their corners
up and play thir safeties over the top, so they were really trying
to take away our outside receivers,'' said Bledsoe. ``And most of
our fast timing (passes) is with our outside receivers, but the
Niners took those guys away, and they played it in such a way that
the stuff we've been working on and focusing on in camp wasn't
really a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Patriots went into the game wanting to work on the
quick timing passes to the outside, the 49ers had the precise
defense to slow that, ``and that's one of the reasons why we
weren't as sharp as we wanted to be,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bledsoe also didn't throw the inside passes well to
counter the defense and was burned when he didn't see San
Francisco's Chris Doleman drop back in a zone blitz, where he
picked off a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal through camp is to build and continually improve
going into the regular season,'' said Bledsoe. ``And I think we're
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons _ not the least of which is that the Patriots
have no established runner _ this offense will be Bledsoe's, and
all football eyes in New England and nationally will focus on how
well he does. And as usual, Bledsoe is going into the season with a
new offensive coordinator and a new quarterback coach.
</P>
<P>
   He is working with his fourth quarterback coach in four seasons
(Jack Reilly now, Carl Smith last season, Chris Palmer in 1996, and
Ray Perkins in '95) and his third offensive coordinator in three
seasons (Ernie Zampese now, Larry Kennan last season, and Perkins
before that). If Bledsoe came into pro football a rough-cut gem
needing a master polisher, he has ended up being passed from hand
to hand.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Bledsoe downplayed the constant change. He
said the switch in offensive schemes from Kennan's to Zampese's is
far from as drastic as was the turnover from Perkins and Bill
Parcells to Kennan last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adjustment, but not as big an adjustment as it has
been in the past,'' said Bledsoe. ``We basically have the same
terminology and basically the same offense as we had (in 1997), but
there is a different emphasis now as far as getting the ball out
quicker. It's not as big an adjustment as it was in the past, but
it's still an adjustment in philosophy and timing and so on. But
we're going to make that adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly used virtually the same words that Blesoe's new coaches
used last year, saying he thought Bledsoe was a fine passer while
watching him from afar and is even more impressed in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were real happy after the 49er game, and Drew
wasn't happy, either,'' said Reilly, who is with his fifth team in
six seasons, having previously worked for the Cowboys, Rams,
Raiders, and Chargers. ``We went into the game with the idea of
running the football. That was a major emphasis at the beginning of
the game, and as we moved on, we lightened up a little bit. But I
feel totally confident. We have five preseason games to get ready
for the Denver game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said the new offense should not be too complicated to
pick up quickly. ``I think it's just a matter of getting used to
different language and different timing and different depth (in
pass routes) than he had before,'' said Reilly. ``It's just a
matter of getting to where they feel comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he and Bledsoe have similar personalities (``We're
both low-key; I don't get super emotional about things, and neither
does he''), but that is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage.
``I think the important thing is how you get the job done,'' said
Reilly, ``and how you handle yourself under emotional strain and
stress. And I think Drew handles it very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he ``was disappointed at the way we performed''
against the 49ers, ``and we've got a ways to go. Fortunately,
though, we've got time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing time, too. Carroll is determined that Bledsoe find his
rhythm Sunday night against Minnesota. And if you see some big guys
in Patriot uniforms tossing the football around in the Foxboro
Stadium parking lot Sunday at midnight, don't be surprised if the
guy with the No. 11 on his back is Drew Bledsoe.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's well past the 11 p.m. bedcheck for the
13- to 17-year-olds attending the Research Science Institute, but
not one of the summer visitors is tucked in with the lights out.
</P>
<P>
   The masses are squeezed into a sweaty dorm lounge, moving their
bodies to the bass in their makeshift dance club. Those not dancing
are playing Ping-Pong or Foosball. In a moonlit courtyard, a few
stragglers chat idly about the film ``Austin Powers,'' or dating,
or astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   No customary lights-out rule exists for the campers in this
summer colony, because the institute is not a traditional camp.
Housed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, these teenagers
have been handed the freedom to make great discoveries _ about
science and about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have reactive minds. Who are we to say how they're
learning or when they're learning?'' says director Mark Saul. ``We
can't say that if they're playing Nintendo or Dungeons &AMP; Dragons,
nothing is going on in their minds. They get treated like adults,
which adolescents crave.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul may seem lenient for an overnight summer-program
administrator, but his motives are clear: He's out to nurture the
brains of these teenagers, considered some of the top prospects to
propel their nations' technological prominence. For six weeks every
summer, 80 of the world'smost gifted high school seniors _ 53
Americans and 27 international students this year _ conduct
college- or graduate-level independent research in math and
science.
</P>
<P>
   In their high schools, some have been branded ``nerds'' and
``geeks,'' or at the very least ``the smart kids.'' But because
everyone at the institute is the smart kid, students say here they
can walk away from the stereotypes and find other components of
their identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something that has defined you socially for so long is
stripped away, it's nice to know there is still a lot left of
you,'' says Jeremy England, 16, of Durham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   According to standardized gauges of intellectual precocity, the
students are nearly uniform. All have scored in the 99th percentile
on their PSATs. Many have skipped a grade _ or two or three. Only
55 of 1,000 American applicants were accepted, defying odds more
dismal than the selectivity rates at the colleges they will attend.
If past institute classes are prologue, more than half of them will
move on to Harvard or MIT after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get here, you realize how special you are _ and how
special you aren't,'' says Charles Mathis, 17, of Watkinsville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, a program of the Center for Excellence in
Education in McLean, Va., was founded 15 years ago by the late
Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and lawyer Joann DiGennaro. The outspoken
``father of the nuclear navy'' bemoaned slipping academic standards
in America's public schools. It roamed from university to
university, finally finding a home in 1992 at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The Rickoids _ as the students like to be called _ work up to 12
hours a day in internships at science and computer labs, zoos,
research centers, and hospitals in the Boston area. At night, the
boys wear suits and ties, the girls dresses, to attend lectures.
The program concludes tomorrow after a final ``hell week'' of
completing papers and making oral presentations in all-night
caffeinated camp-outs at the computer labs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hanging with peers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this intellectual haven, stimulation comes from teachers, to
be sure, but also from comrades with whom these young scholars can
slow dance and play ultimate Frisbee. For many of them, this is the
first time academic exhilaration has fused with social nourishment
in the same setting _ a summer colony of colossal brainpower and
young blood.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen young men crowd around a Ping-Pong table and gush
admiringly about a certain girl. But it's not the usual locker-room
talk one might expect of teenage boys. ``She's so smart, she should
just clone herself,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   At the institute's talent show, one 13-year-old girl sings the
``Titanic'' theme song _ after rewriting the lyrics as a paean to
neutrinos, atomic particles that have almost no mass.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their intellectual prowess, the Rickoids can be
quite down to earth. Like other teenagers, they wear T-shirts and
gym shoes, play musical instruments and varsity team sports, and
exchange prized lines from ``Austin Powers.'' All that came as a
pleasant surprise to students who had internalized their peers'
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought everyone would have thick glasses, high pants, and
squeaky voices _ the typical nerd,'' says Lavanya Parachuru, 15, of
Duluth, Ga. ``We try to be normal; we try to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with painful modesty that some Rickoids disclose
their achievements. England, a student at Phillips Exeter Academy,
was in third grade when his father, a professor at the University
of New Hampshire, asked a fellow chemistry prof to show his kid
around the lab.
</P>
<P>
   It started out with lessons on the structure of atoms _ ``neat
little chemistry things a little kid can appreciate,'' recalls
England, a lanky boy with a mop of brown hair. By the eighth grade,
he finished calculus and was studying the ``jiggling'' of the
earth's magnetic field. England was always enamored of physics, he
says, and has just recently delved into biology. ``Life just blows
me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now cloaked in a white lab coat in a Northeastern science lab,
he's holding what looks like a turkey baster, measuring microliters
of a buffer solution. In his molecular biology project under mentor
Monsoor Amiji, a Northeastern pharmaceutics professor, he is
researching how protein drugs, such as insulin, can effectively be
delivered into a patient's body when encased in a polymeric
molecule.
</P>
<P>
   He insists it's much less complicated than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   But in his absence, Amiji assesses England's research as
master's thesis level. ``You can imagine how bright he is,'' Amiji
says of England, his second student referred by the institute.
``The guy came in on the first day and started playing with all
these computers I have in here. He quickly learned the software
program in a week.'' He chuckles and shakes his head. ``If I did
it, it would probably take me a month to learn how to turn it
on.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A nurturing environment

   For a summer, the Rickoids leave some of their problems behind.
Those who attend mediocre high schools say they search, often
without success, for challenging classes, adequate resources, and
strong teaching. ``I always felt there was something missing in
me,'' says Attay Guvench, 17, of Falmouth, Maine, a town of 9,000.
At the institute, he is helping to create antennae for submarines.
``If you wanted to know something, it was hard to find the person
to teach it to you or the right book to read. Here, I can go find
that book or person to get the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder DiGennaro, however, acknowledges that locating
funding for programs for the intellectually precocious has been
tricky. Most schools earmark money to meet the needs of students at
the bottom, she says, rarely offering programs for those at the
top. Therefore the institute has been primarily funded by corporate
sponsors in what DiGennaro says is its mission to help train the
minds of the most promising few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty lonely world, having the brain of a
brilliant person in the body of a child,'' she says. ``They don't
have much. One in 10,000 students are like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul, a math teacher at Bronxville High School in New York,
watches over the students as the resident father figure. He lurks
on their electronic bulletin boards and scolds sleepyheads at
lectures. But as colorful metaphors sail from his lips, it becomes
clear he possesses the power to stimulate, the passion to educate,
the ability to bring out genius in adolescent minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in them my own misspent youth,'' he says. ``I never had
a program like this. I grew up in the Bronx and had to build my own
environment. I had to find people who valued intellectual growth,
who loved math and science. No one acknowledged our abilities and
interests. No one acknowledged our subculture.''
</P>
<P>
   When he shifts focus to the students, his pale blue eyes reveal
both concern and recollection. ``These kids are begging for
stimulation. They are generally underserved. I see my old friends
in these kids.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A variety of futures
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Rickoids will meet again after the program ends. The
future holds in store math and science olympiads, Westinghouse
science competitions, and college. Many will return to Cambridge
for college _ perhaps influenced by one indelible summer memory. As
Saul knows, Rickoids will make their presence known.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday morning, when the students are exchanging teary
goodbyes, Saul will sleep in. ``It's too painful. Everyone's
crying. It's very bad,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough to know I'll see them again, and that they'll
find each other again,'' he adds. ``They're like a bunch of bad
pennies.''
</P>
<P>
   If they're like the last classes, these Rickoids will become
professors, doctors, scientists _ even investment bankers and
lawyers. Finally freed to escape labels and explore other parts of
themselves, many will leave with a quiet confidence that they, as
Whitman said, contain multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Guvench, for one, dreams of playing in a band. ``Life is too
short, and the world is too big to focus on one thing,'' he says.
``Everyone I know is really good at something.''

A DISTRESS CALL FROM THE FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - From her wheelchair, Debra Richard holds the line for
people like us. She lives in a hunkered-down house in a
hunkered-down neighborhood, unseen, unknown, within the boundaries
of the city but at the edge of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   And she does not yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our home,'' she says. ``I live here with my mom. She's
71. My father lives nearby. I have seen a lot of changes but I'm
not running, no matter how scary it gets. It's just that sometimes,
like after what happened these last few weeks, you want people to
know what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Her house is on a narrow street south of Baseline Road. From
some of the windows you can see the slopes of South Mountain, but
only if the metal security shields are rolled up.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that's not often.
</P>
<P>
   When Debra was younger she was paralyzed from the waist down in
an automobile accident. It didn't stop her from living her life.
She has a son, now 15, whom she's managed to raise in a tough
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good boy,'' she says. ``He's not into any of the gang
stuff. I'd know if he was. But that isn't the only trouble there is
around here.'' &QL; 
SUDDENLY A TARGET
</P>
<P>
   Late last month at a nearby park, Debra's son got into a fight.
No one was hurt, and the family didn't fret over what happened
until later that night, when Debra was awakened by two loud booms
from the street. Someone had fired a shotgun at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the police and told them what happened,'' Debra
says. ``But we didn't see the shooting. They told us there wasn't
anything they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   She says officers spoke to kids in the neighborhood, but no one
admitted anything and no witnesses were found. Debra was worried
about her son, though, and asked officers what she should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `Send him away,' '' she says. ``They said
whoever did this would probably come back and there was no way to
protect him 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of thing people in Debra's neighborhood must
deal with, while the rest of us fret over the stain on a White
House intern's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Debra called a brother who lives out of state. He offered to
take in her son. Reluctantly, she sent him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think of my boy first,'' she says. ``It was a hard
thing to do, and I miss him, but I don't know that I had any other
choice. I've called every agency there is, talked to the police, to
volunteer groups. There aren't many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, someone took another shot at Debra's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't home and my mother didn't hear it, but there was a
bullet in the front door,'' she says. ``I'm calling you so that, if
you hear on the TV about two ladies getting shot in south Phoenix,
you'll know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what life is like on the front lines. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAVING A NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   Still, Debra doesn't want to leave. It's her home. There are
memories in this place, and possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't she believe it?
</P>
<P>
   From her yard she can sit and watch as the giant antennas on top
of South Mountain scratch the bellies of passing clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The police say neighborhoods like Debra's only survive if the
neighbors band together, form watch committees and coordinate their
efforts with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be needed if parents just taught their kids
respect,'' Debra says. ``But, not all of them do. So this is what
it's like, for some of us. I just wanted you to understand. To
know.''
</P>
<P>
   She figures maybe the rest of us can pressure politicians into
beefing up police presence in struggling neighborhoods like hers.
And encourage business people to invest in the place.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe even drive down there, under the freeway, across the
riverbed, to support those businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Or, we can ignore her part of town and wait until people like
Debra give up and move out. And the next neighborhood becomes the
front line. And the next. And the next. And ours.
</P>
<P>
   Then, we'll understand. Then, we'll know. &QL;

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BECKET, Mass. _ At a nod from the young contestant, the bucket
shoot swung open and out bounded Kyle Robinson, 7, astride a
bucking steer named Tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado heaved and twisted. Kyle managed to hold on for about 4
seconds before spinning off into the dirt _ not long enough to win
the steer-riding contest at the youth rodeo in Becket last weekend,
but long enough for his self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodeo is not about winning, it's about believing you can do
it,'' the little guy said philosophically, as he dusted himself
off. ``It's really tough to be a cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Robinson, a cowboy from Connecticut, and the members
of his Berkshire Rodeo Team, are determined to bring Wild
West-style thrills to Yankee hills. They're trying to establish New
England's only permanent rodeo-in-residence, and they say they're
bucking many misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, most people associate rodeo with hicks _
people with tight jeans and big belt buckles,'' said Elizabeth
Myrick 14, a freshman at Wahconah High School, in Dalton, before
the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people drive by and see us practicing, they yell
`Yee-haw' and `Yippie-ki-yi-yay,''' added 'Tine Decker, a
12-year-old barrel racer and an 8th grader at Lenox Middle School.
``Or they tease us by saying `Howdy' all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   'Tine, an honors student and self-described ``horsaholic,'' has
been riding since she was five years old. But in staid New England,
that meant private trail rides or sessions at private stables or
riding clubs, where competitions focused mainly on English-style
jumping and dressage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pretty snobby,'' said her mother, Deb Decker, of Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   By joining the Berkshire Rodeo Team, the youths _ currently four
boys and seven girls, ages 7 to 17 _ and their parents are pooling
their resources, sharing skills and equipment under Robinson's
watchful eye, to make possible something none could achieve alone.
</P>
<P>
   With welding and carpentry help from some of the fathers, and
supplies that were bartered or donated, Robinson built the rodeo
arena and the stables on 200 acres he inherited from his
great-grandfather. The kids helped dig fence post holes, level
pasture land, clean paddocks, care for the horses. To finance the
project, team members held car washes; parents sold baked goods,
T-shirts, and raffle tickets; local merchants bought rodeo banners
advertising their wares.
</P>
<P>
   And parents formed a nonprofit Berkshire Rodeo Team Association
to take donations, apply _ thus far unsuccessfully _ for grants,
and help organize rodeo logistics.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the brainchild of Robinson, 42, a former firefighter
and part-time cowboy who grew up in New Haven, which hardly was a
haven for cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up on a street corner in the inner city, no one talked
about rodeo,'' said Robinson, recalling his predominately black
neighborhood. ``They all wanted to be basketball or football
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his school lunch money on horse-and-rider magazines and
watched cowboy shows every Saturday morning, featuring Wild West
heroes like Roy Rogers and John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked about them was, whatever happened, they could
handle it,'' Robinson said. ``No matter how bad the situation, they
were cool and collected.''
</P>
<P>
   So he became a fireman, which was as close as he could get in
New Haven to this essential cowboy ethos, Robinson concluded. But
on weekends, summers, whenever he could get free, he rode horses on
the Becket farm, or trained horses, or gave riding lessons, or
journeyed to some rodeo, wherever he could find one.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day &UR;  &LR; he was working as a fireman, standing atop a
burning roof as it began to collapse, thinking he might not survive
the blaze. ``And I thought, `What am I afraid of?''' Robinson
recalled. ```What am I waiting for?'''
</P>
<P>
   So last February, he retired from the fire department to devote
himself full-time to building a home-grown New England rodeo team.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far this summer, the team with help from parents has staged
three rodeos, with one more scheduled for August 29, at the Sunny
Banks farm in Becket. Any interested youth _ not just team members
_ can compete.
</P>
<P>
   Because this rodeo is especially for youngsters under 18, they
ride steers instead of broncos or bulls. As in adult rodeos,
competition also includes steer-roping, calf-wrestling, and racing
horses in a cloverleaf formation around three barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Team members come from a range of economic circumstances, ethnic
backgrounds, geographic locales. Some have been struggling with
personal problems _ such as depression, hyperactivity, low
self-esteem, or broken families. What they share is a love of
animals, a willingness to work on Robinson's ranch, and a desire to
learn about rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just always loved horses,'' said Teresa Torchia, 10,
expressing a common reason for joining the team. She has been
riding for three years, although she couldn't reach the stirrups
until last Tuesday, said the 4-foot, 3-inch cowgirl. She added that
``Black Beauty'' is her favorite book.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the safety of rodeo for youngsters, parents said
they occasionally worry but feel that the risks are well within
acceptable bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has established a structure, and he keeps everything
under control,'' Deb Drucker said. ``If you're not listening, not
doing the safe thing, you're off that horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is donating his time to teach rodeo skills and
discipline, said no one has been seriously injured thus far. And
he, as well as several parents, said they have seen amazing changes
in the children since they began rodeoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before she started this, she was depressed, didn't hardly wash
her hair or bathe, just stayed in her room all the time,'' said
Cindy Taylor, of Becket, referring to her daughter, Angela, now 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's lost 30 pounds, got a lot of friends in school, goes
to dances, helps around the house. She took on some jobs to earn
her entry fees'' of $5 per rodeo, added Taylor. ``It's really
brought her confidence up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Robinson hopes to have weekly rodeos, establish
an ongoing rodeo school and build cabins where visiting rodeo
participants can stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living my dream,'' he said happily, ``and it just keeps
growing.''

about her son, though, and asked officers what she should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `Send him away,' '' she says. ``They said
whoever did this would probably come back and there was no way to
protect him 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of thing people in Debra's neighborhood must
deal with, while the rest of us fret over the stain on a White
House intern's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Debra called a brother who lives out of state. He offered to
take in her son. Reluctantly, she sent him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think of my boy first,'' she says. ``It was a hard
thing to do, and I miss him, but I don't know that I had any other
choice. I've called every agency there is, talked to the police, to
volunteer groups. There aren't many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, someone took another shot at Debra's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't home and my mother didn't hear it, but there was a
bullet in the front door,'' she says. ``I'm calling you so that, if
you hear on the TV about two ladies getting shot in south Phoenix,
you'll know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what life is like on the front lines. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAVING A NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   Still, Debra doesn't want to leave. It's her home. There are
memories in this place, and possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't she believe it?
</P>
<P>
   From her yard she can sit and watch as the giant antennas on top
of South Mountain scratch the bellies of passing clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The police say neighborhoods like Debra's only survive if the
neighbors band together, form watch committees and coordinate their
efforts with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be needed if parents just taught their kids
respect,'' Debra says. ``But, not all of them do. So this is what
it's like, for some of us. I just wanted you to understand. To
know.''
</P>
<P>
   She figures maybe the rest of us can pressure politicians into
beefing up police presence in struggling neighborhoods like hers.
And encourage business people to invest in the place.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe even drive down there, under the freeway, across the
riverbed, to support those businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Or, we can ignore her part of town and wait until people like
Debra give up and move out. And the next neighborhood becomes the
front line. And the next. And the next. And ours.
</P>
<P>
   Then, we'll understand. Then, we'll know. &QL;

A POPULATION WARY IN `GOOD TIMES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GEETA ANAND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOBURN, Mass. _ If the 1980s were an era of intoxicating
affluence, this election year is a time of sober prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is humming in most of Massachusetts. Salaries are
rising, and most people can pay their rent and mortgages. For those
without a job, newspapers are full of Help Wanted ads.
</P>
<P>
   But voters are not reveling in the good times. They worry
intensely, across age and gender lines, about two commodities more
precious than money: their children and their health.
</P>
<P>
   And most believe strongly that government should help.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Joanne Kovic, a single parent and the
manager of Bayview Kennels in West Barnstable, who wouldn't worry
if she lost her job _ but is clearly frustrated by two things she
believes are out of her control: education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this place burned down tomorrow, I could get another job,''
she said as she ran a wire comb over a pit bull's back. ``The pay's
not bad. I scrape by. But the schools, they're another thing. And
health care? It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to their children, residents decry what they view
as lackluster public schools, the high cost and low quality of day
care, and the pervasiveness of violence on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the money into kids,'' said Ed Wild, an engineer with EMC
Corp. in Hopkinton who mentors a 10-year-old boy through the Big
Brother Association. ``Kids are the guts of this century. It's
really important what morals they have.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their health, many residents complained of either not
being able to afford health insurance, or knowing people who
cannot. And they resent a government that doesn't help with what
they believe is such a basic human need.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Rodriguez, a hardware store owner in Springfield, said he
and his wife and new baby have no health benefits because the
cheapest plan cost $700 a month when he last checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government could do something, that would be great,''
he said. As he speaks, he clutches a book on how to write a
business plan. He is ambitious, anxious to live the American dream,
but clearly frustrated by roadblocks like the high cost of health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat, I live, I wear nice suits to church on Sunday
mornings,'' he said. ``But I want more. I want to prosper; I don't
want to just survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Most of the 119 residents interviewed in all
regions of the state for this story are not pining for a big,
intrusive government. Rather, they believe in an activist one:
lean, but compassionate, and willing to make tough choices. And not
tomorrow, but today.
</P>
<P>
   And they say they want a governor who will work to solve
specific problems, not simply cut taxes or mouth platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Their mood is decidedly different from that of the last two
state elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, anger at perceived government overspending and
ineffectiveness helped elect William F. Weld, the first Republican
to be elected governor in two decades. Massachusetts was in a
recession, and people were focused on finding jobs and keeping
their houses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, although the economy was on the mend, the electorate
was still consumed with pocketbook issues. Public education was as
troubled then as now, and health care nearly as expensive. But
voters focused on job security, and credited Weld with sorting out
the state's finances and fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the concerns have shifted. People describing
their wish-list for the next governor rarely mentioned cutting
taxes, and never talked about government excess. Only three said
they pay too much in taxes _ in spite of the recent high-volume
debate on Beacon Hill over tax cuts, and Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci's televison ads promising to lower the state income tax
rate from 5.95 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touting a tax cut seems so foolish,'' says Michael Kelley, a
locksmith with children ages 10 and 7 who recently moved from
Boston to Hopkinton in search of more space and better schools.
``What's that in savings _ a hundred bucks? A night out? It seems
to me the money should be put into education.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the state's billion-dollar budget surplus, most people
want the government to invest the money in the future. And in their
mind, the future is the children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Education came up time and again in conversation. Voters are
irritated that nearly 60 percent of would-be teachers failed a
certification test earlier this summer. They worry about high
school students from other nations scoring higher than American
kids in science and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disgrace, those teachers failing the test,'' Lorraine
Casey of North Wilmington said as she sat on a bench with two
grandchildren in the Woburn Mall while their mother shopped nearby.
``Something's wrong with the schools and colleges if teachers can't
pass the test. It just blew me away _ four years of college and
they can't pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Those advocating better schools include people who do not have
children, or whose children are long grown. The flush economy may
not have inspired a feeling of security, but it is nurturing a
spirit of generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Pedrosa, 39, president of a Lowell electronics
manufacturing company, does not have children. But he would spend
more money on education in elementary and high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge number of startups in Massachusetts because of
the great (college) education here,'' he said. ``The economy has
moved away from manufacturing to high tech. We have to have a
skilled labor force.''
</P>
<P>
   As an employer, Pedrosa sees many of his 150 workers struggling
with child care _ another major concern voiced by residents across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   They say there isn't enough child care available, and what's
available is too expensive for the average two-earner couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``More companies should have day care on site,'' said Arlyss
Thomasino of Norwood as she shopped at the Natick Mall with her
father and newborn baby. ``Government should encourage that with
tax breaks or subsidies or something. How else can any of us afford
to work?''
</P>
<P>
   Their children's exposure to violence and sex in popular culture
disturbs many Massachusetts residents. They worry what effect such
exposure will have, and believe government should take steps to
curb it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should think about all the filth on television
for our children,'' said Francis Fay of Methuen, 78, a grandmother
shopping in the produce section of a Lawrence gorcery store. ``The
language is disgusting. There aren't too many good things on except
sex and violence. Why can't they put in rules?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that 97 percent of those who responded to a
Pulse of Massachusetts poll taken by the Globe in May said they had
health insurance, many residents interviewed at random this summer
said they had none _ usually because they owned or worked for a
company too small to offer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And paying premiums on their own, they said, could cost as much
as a month's rent. As a result, many people aren't going to the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pavao, a salesman at Stride Rite in Barnstable who has no
insurance, figures it's been at least eight years since he's seen a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford it,'' said Pavao, who makes less than $30,000 a
year. ``Our franchise is too small for group (rates). Some kind of
subsidy for health insurance would be nice for people like me who
are in the lower end of the middle-income bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Maietta, an accountant from Milford who has a good job with
benefits, is willing to have the state use extra revenue to
subsidize health insurance for those who don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Be they in the valleys of the Berkshire hills or the
three-deckers of Boston, by the inlets of Cape Cod or along the
canals of Lowell, the people of Massachusetts share a sense of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   If the state's problems can't be solved in good times, they say,
they'll never be solved. And their children and their health are
too important to be left to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Says roofer Mark Table of Springfield: ``I want the best for my
kids. A good education. I want them to do good in life. If not now,
then when?''

THANKS FOR THE MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of my Chicago youth was the occasional bout
of car trouble. It gave me an excuse to visit Warshawsky &AMP; Co., a
vast auto-parts warehouse on the wrong end of State Street. You'd
get a salesman's advice on choosing a new ignition coil or a
rebuilt alternator, then wander through the fan belts and pine-tree
air fresheners till the goodies emerged from a room out back. There
were few better ways to spend an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they didn't have personal computer stores back then.
These days, I prefer to hang out at a Cambridge, Mass. shop called
PCs for Everyone, a Warshawsky for nerds. Go to CompUSA for
attractive decor and lavish displays of merchandise. PCs for
Everyone is a boxy, bare-walled place with a carpet-covered bench
where you can sit and wait while the guy out back finds that hard
drive you asked for.
</P>
<P>
   There are salespeople in some stores whose only computer
experience is working a cash register. Not here. I hardly ever
visit without learning something, though the education generally
costs a few bucks. Like my recent quest for more memory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when I did a major computer upgrade, I
decided to keep using my old memory chips. I had 40 megabytes of
old RAM and the system worked well enough. But some of my software
experiments demand a bit more _ at least 64 megs more. Memory has
never been cheaper. I could get 64 megs for a little over $100. But
what kind?
</P>
<P>
   Like many newer motherboards, mine has two different sets of
memory slots. One set accepts the old-style memory chips, while the
other is designed for a faster type of computer memory called
Synchronous DRAM or SDRAM. SDRAM is designed to pump out data
significantly faster than the older type of memory chip. SDRAM is
standard equipment on many new machines. If you're in the market,
don't settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Why is SDRAM better? Convenience, for one thing. Memory chips
come attached to little modules that look like miniature circuit
boards, and plug into slots inside the motherboard. But when you
use old-style memory in Pentium-type machines, you have to install
the modules two at a time. You can't buy one 16-megabyte module to
upgrade your machine. You need two modules of 8 megs each.
</P>
<P>
   Since most computers have just four slots for this kind of
memory, you run out fast. I've had to discard perfectly good memory
modules to make room for bigger ones. But this problem goes away
with SDRAM modules, which can be inserted one at a time. Just buy
one 64-megabyte module and you're set.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the sheer speed at which the computer can read and
write data to the chips. Never mind how fast your processor is;
these days the bottleneck between the processor and the memory is
at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   The data travels back and forth along a set of wires called a
bus, which is tuned to a particular frequency _ usually 66
megahertz. That means that pulses of data travel across the bus 66
million times every second. But old-style memory chips can't even
manage half that rate. So the computer spends half its time just
waiting for something to do. A newer kind of memory called EDO DRAM
is somewhat faster, but still not that hot. Ideally, you'd want
memory that can move data at exactly the same speed as the bus _
synchronized, in other words. And that's possible with SDRAM.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside. SDRAM doesn't get along well with the older
type of memory, so my old chips would have to go. No problem: I'll
save them for my next building project.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw there were two kinds of SDRAM, one about $40 cheaper
than the other. Not one to pass up a bargain, I began reaching for
the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said the salesman. He warned me that there are two
kinds of SDRAM out there. ``SDRAM Lite'' works on today's
motherboards. But the next wave of computers use boards that run at
100 megahertz, compared with today's 66-megahertz standard. SDRAM
Lite chips won't work with these boards, so I'd have to throw away
the memory the next time I upgrade. Pay a bit more for top-drawer
SDRAM, and it'll be good for years.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman kept me from doing something dumb, and got a few
extra bucks out of me at the same time. It was like the old days at
Warshawsky, only without the fan belts.

TALKING TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT GENOCIDE AND SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When one of my son's choices from his fifth-grade summer reading
list was ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' I felt a moment of panic. Was
he ready for this?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the more accurate question was the one I came to a day
or two later: Was I ready for him to be ready?
</P>
<P>
   Talking to our children about humankind's most awful deeds is
not easy for any parent. For those of us whose cultural heritage
includes a history of victimization, our personal sensitivity can
make it an even more onerous task. The Holocaust, slavery, the
genocide in Armenia or Cambodia _ these are painful subjects for us
to think about, let alone share with children.
</P>
<P>
   Our instinct to shield them is appropriate when they are young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3- to 6-year-old is easily overwhelmed by his own
imagination just in the normal course of things,'' says
developmental psychologist Joseph Reimer of Brandeis University.
It's normal, indeed common, for a preschooler to worry about
horrible things happening to his parents. ``So when you talk about
actual horrible things that have happened, it feeds his fantasies
even more,'' says Reimer. ``It makes him feel the world is unsafe
and he is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you don't need to go out of your way to talk
about the Holocaust or slavery with a preschooler. On the other
hand, if it comes up for any reason, including because there's a
survivor in your family, it's better to deal with it no matter what
her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say things like, `You're too young to know about
that,' or, `Don't be looking at those pictures,' you shut a child
down. The conclusion he comes to can range from, `Mom doesn't care
about this, it's not important,' to, `This is too difficult to talk
about, so I won't,''' says educator William S. Parsons. He is chief
of staff at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and
cofounder of Facing History and Ourselves, a national teacher
training organization in Brookline, Mass. that focuses on the
Holocaust and other examples of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A 4-year-old's question
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best first conversation with your child happens because he
initiates it. Most likely, it will catch you by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Beverly Daniel Tantum's first conversation with son
Jonathan happened in the grocery store. He was 4, perched in the
shopping cart. ``If Africa is so great, what are we doing here?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Tantum, a professor and dean at Mount Holyoke College, remembers
wanting to make three points. ``First,'' she says, ``I didn't want
him to think this was going to happen to him; kids this age are
very concrete in their thinking. Second, I didn't want him to think
his ancestors were just passive victims, and third, I didn't want
him to think all white people are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What she told him went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, long time ago, before there were grocery stores or
houses, the Europeans came and they wanted to build roads and
houses. It was going to be a lot of work, so they went to Africa to
get the strongest, smartest workers they could find. They didn't
want to pay them, so they kidnapped them and brought them here as
slaves. The Africans had to work very hard and they didn't get
paid. That was really unfair, so the Africans who were kidnapped
did whatever they could to escape, and even though some white
people did the kidnapping, other white people thought this was
unfair, too, and they tried to help them escape and to stop
slavery, which they eventually did.'' Tantum is the author of ``Why
Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria and other
Conversations about Race'' (Basic Books), which includes a section
on talking about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer says these points are good to keep in mind when talking
about genocide, too. ``With all children, but especially those
under 10, you don't want to paint a story that's all negative, all
passive,'' he says. ``That creates a troublesome dynamic: `Am I
part of these people who are always getting bashed?' No child can
indentify with that without being scared out of his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Setting the stage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Jessica Henderson Daniel tells parents that the
preschool years are a time to tell stories about the richness of
your heritage. Without that, she says, conversations about genocide
or slavery will seem to a child to be the beginning of the story
and the touchstone of their identity.
</P>
<P>
   This is as important a strategy for children whose ancestors
were the oppressors as for those who were the oppressed. Daniel
says many white or gentile children often feel hopelessness after
hearing about slavery or the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   She tells of a white first grader who told his mother, ``We're
bad people because we made blacks sit on the back of the bus.'' His
mother said only, ``You're right,'' which he took literally to
heart. Daniel says a better answer would have continued: ```But you
know what? There were a lot of white people who helped blacks.' By
talking about the Freedom Riders, or the Dutch who hid Jews, you
hold up models of courage and bravery,'' says Daniel. ``That
empowers children; it gives them hope.''

 UNDATED: ... gives them hope.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because children under 7 are not only concrete but also
egocentric, Daniel tells parents to answer the question, ``What
about me?'' even if it doesn't get asked. ``For a first or second
grader hearing about slavery or the Holocaust for the first time,
there can be a lot of hurt. They wonder, `Is someone going to do
that to me, 'cause I'm black/Jewish, too?'''
</P>
<P>
   Her answer would be honest but hopeful: ``This won't happen to
you, but it's true there are still people in the world who are
racist (or anti-Semitic). There are also people who are not and
they are working all the time to make sure blacks (or Jews, or
Armenians, etc.) are treated fairly. That makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Talking to 10-year-olds
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 10, your message can include the idea that it is part of our
job to make sure things like this don't happen again, says Marc
Skvirsky, national program director at Facing History and
Ourselves. ``By fifth grade, they're beginning to get the idea of
justice,'' he says. ``You can ask things like, `Why do you think
prejudice exists? Where does it start?'''
</P>
<P>
   The more you get it down to your child's level, the better: What
about name calling on the playground? What do you and your friends
do when other kids poke fun at someone? Why is it that some people
turn their heads when they see something unjust and others don't?
What does it take to have courage?
</P>
<P>
   Middle school is prime time for racial jokes. When kids tell him
the jokes aren't a big deal, Parsons tells them about Julius
Streichter, one of 22 Nazis executed at the Nuremberg Trials.
``Streichter never killed anyone,'' he explains, ``but he wrote
such awful things about the Jews in his magazines that he broke the
moral backbone of the nation and he was found just as guilty as
people who murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons says this is a stunner for students. ``It's when the
power of words hits them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Just because children may begin to grasp the issues doesn't mean
they'll change their behaviors. Parsons cautions parents not to be
discouraged. ``It'll kick in later,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also tells parents not to feel you have to have an answer all
the time. ``Just because a kid raises an issue doesn't mean you
have to teach the whole thing all at once,'' says Parsons. In fact,
it's better to teach it little by little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he says, ``the best message to give a child, even
one who is older, is that these things are very complicated and
they can be painful to think and talk about. But they matter a lot
and thinking about them is important.''
</P>
<P>
   As my son gets deeper into ``Anne Frank,'' I find that very
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Children under 9 can't grasp the enormity of slavery or
genocide. Personalize it for them with stories about children.
</P>
<P>
   _A parent's first task is to make sure a child feels safe.
</P>
<P>
   _It's better for children to hear about these topics from you
before they hear about it in school. Find out when slavery or the
Holocaust is introduced in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   _Typical questions a young child might ask: ``Will there be
another Hitler?'' A good answer: ``There are always bad people in
the world, but there are also always good people. We hope there
won't be another Hitler. That's why it's important to vote and be
involved in our democracy, because we're in charge of choosing our
leaders.'' Q: ``Why did the Germans hate the Jews so much?'' A:
``Some people feel better when they put other people down, so they
make up lies and stories about them.''
</P>
<P>
   _Typical questions an older child might ask: ``Why do we have to
talk about this?'' A: ``We can't just pretend it didn't happen. We
remember because we don't want it to happen again.'' Q: ``When we
talk about slavery in school, everyone looks at me. Do they want me
to be a slave?'' A: ``Some people might think like that, but most
don't. You belong in that class, just like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   _Offer examples of people who are working to keep bad things
from happening, especially examples from your child's life.
</P>
<P>
   _Save photographs of concentration camps or of slaves, or movies
like ``Schindler's List'' or ``Amistad'' for a child in eighth
grade or above. ``Anne Frank'' is generally recommended for seventh
grade or above.
</P>
<P>
   _Retired child psychiatrist Maurice Vanderpool of Brookline, who
is a Holocaust survivor and a Facing History volunteer, says that
when there is a survivor in the family, there is no magic age for
telling grandchildren. ``The survivor and the children both need to
be ready,'' he says. He waited until his grandchildren were school
age.

   WARNING: The following column is about the president of the
United States _ which means of course it's rated NC-17 and is
intended for mature audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I hear about Monica Lewinsky and that stained dress
of hers _ a navy blue number from the Gap _ a certain song made
popular by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels comes to mind:
</P>
<P>
   Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
</P>
<P>
   Devil with the blue dress on!
</P>
<P>
   Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
</P>
<P>
   Devil with the blue dress on!
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the more obscure _ and much more graphic _
dance-pop song from the Prince-protege group known as Vanity 6. The
song was called ``Pretty Mess,'' and was about this fella who, um,
left his mark on Vanity's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Parody artists and DJs, feel free to go nuts with this
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty Mess'' notwithstanding, I'll go with ``Devil With the
Blue Dress On'' as Lewinsky's official theme song, because she IS a
devilish raven, no matter how this thing plays out. Either she has
plunged us deep into a sordid saga because she concocted a fantasy
romance with Bill Clinton _ or she really did have a series of
cheap sex encounters with the president of the United States in the
White House, and then blabbed like a barroom floozy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, I'm tired of the reverse sexism that dominates
nearly every discussion about this alleged affair. It takes two to
tryst.
</P>
<P>
   I know: The older, married man in the position of power _ in
this case the ultimate position of power _ has to bear the brunt of
the responsibility for playing around with an impressionable,
vulnerable young woman.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky was a young woman, not a girl, by the time the
romping began. Years older than, say, a Jerry Seinfeld girlfriend
or a Woody Allen wife. She was beyond the age of adult consent,
beyond the age when one is allowed to drink, vote, join the
military, own a house _ or have sex with a horny buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton made the first move, Lewinsky could have told him to
buzz off. If she was the seductress, it was her choice. She was not
``victimized.'' As I've said before, it's an insult to young adults
everywhere to say someone in her early 20s can't fend for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume there was a series of encounters with Clinton. That
means he's a lying idiot _ and she's a pathetic, attention-starved
young woman who acted like a spurned fourth-grader when her sleazy
sex affair with a married father started to fade. Consider her
behavior: The bitter, juvenile tone of her recorded phone
conversations with Linda Tripp; the bragging to friends about
having picked out a necktie the president was wearing; the idea
that she saved a stained dress and gave it to her mother for
safekeeping. Who acts like this outside of guests on ``Springer''?
Any young women you know?
</P>
<P>
   Me neither.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's crass behavior and Clinton's lewd behavior aside, I
still say it's Hillary who should be outraged, not a special
prosecutor or Congress. Even as I see the familiar Republican faces
blabbing on TV about impeachment, even as I sort through the daily
barrage of E-mail messages from Clinton-bashers who must have the
phrases ``suborning perjury,'' ``lying under oath'' and ``moral
issue'' on their computer's save-get keys, I want to stand on a
mountaintop and scream:
</P>
<P>
   ARE WE ALL INSANE OR WHAT?!?!?!?
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, Kenneth Starr launched an investigation into
the Whitewater matter _ and somehow that led him to a McCarthyesque
witch-hunt that's so ludicrous it defies belief. While we're still
inside this chapter of history, I want to go on record as saying
this is a ridiculous, embarrassing investigation that should have
been abandoned a long time ago. Even if Clinton and Lewinsky were
to hold a joint press conference today to announce they're in love
and they intend to marry someday, it still wouldn't be cause for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing any of us can do to stop this rollercoaster
from completing its course. The stories will keep on coming, the
leaks will keep on leaking, and sometime in the near future the
country will be told exactly what caused the stain on that garment
of Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   She's not too skinny, she's not too fat, she's a real humdinger
and I like 'em like that! Devil with the blue dress, blue dress,

ADMIRAL FOUGHT FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before there was the Research Science Institute, there was the
Rickover Science Institute, the brainchild of a brash, stubborn
admiral, himself widely acclaimed as a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Though more famous as the father of the nuclear Navy, Admiral
Hyman G. Rickover spoke out fiercely on education. Decrying an
``education crisis'' in 1959, he insisted that schools, unless
overhauled, would fail to produce mathematicians and scientists who
could help the United States stay competitive with the Soviet Union
and other nations. He urged more technical courses, higher teacher
pay, and higher standards, while scoffing at ``mediocre teachers,''
``lousy parents,'' and useless electives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, an 84-year-old Rickover announced the inauguration of
the Rickover Science Institute. When a reporter asked if he thought
RSI students would be discontented after returning from the program
to their local high schools in the fall, Rickover said, ``I hope to
hell they're discontented and start working hard and stop loafing
like most of the high school students do.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral's blunt and even scathing remarks did not cease in
institute summers to come. To one young man who introduced himself
to Rickover as the brightest physics student in the country, the
caustic admiral countered, ``You may think you are the brightest,
but you are the dumbest kid I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would catch them off guard, and they were in awe of him,''
said institute cofounder Joann DiGennaro who, with Rickover,
visited the teenagers every night during the first two summers.
After suffering a stroke, Rickover made his last public
presentation at 1985's RSI closing ceremony, reading the speech
from his wheelchair as DiGennaro held the notes. He died the
following year, at 86.
</P>
<P>
   DiGennaro remembers Rickover as a ``renaissance scholar,'' who
read poetry and autobiographies instead of science and math books _
because, DiGennaro recalls him saying, ``those are things you just
pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   The child of poor Polish Russian immigrants never claimed to be
ingenious, DiGennaro said, but he demanded the best from others and
from himself. When two members of the first institute class took
first and second place at the Westinghouse Science Talent Search
competition, he questioned why his students coudn't win all 10 top
places.

TWO LITTLE SECRETS TO SUCCESSFUL PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the old Army advice to the yardbird? If it moves,
salute it. If it doesn't, paint it.
</P>
<P>
   And who in the Army or other service hasn't painted the rocks at
the commandant's quarters. The handyman actually did this 47 years
ago at good old Fort Ord, Calif., before shipping off to Korea.
It's funny, the things one remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, who of us has not painted, indoors or out?
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that often when you set up to do a painting job,
get everything together, and discover all the brushes stiff as a
board in their cans, you need a day of cleaning to get them
workable.
</P>
<P>
   It's your own fault, y'know, having neglected to clean the
brushes immediately after use. It's probably better to buy new ones
instead of reviving the dead ones.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to the two cardinal rules when painting: Buy
quality (expensive) brushes and clean them properly _ and
immediately _ after use. The more expensive the brush, chances are
the better quality it is, making painting easier and better
looking. The high cost is also an incentive to making sure you do
clean them.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap brush will produce a cheap job, full of brush strokes
and stray bits of filament (bristle) showing.
</P>
<P>
   A way of getting around this is to use a disposable brush. A
foam brush is the best of the throwaways, giving a fair finish at a
small price. This might not settle well with an old-time painter or
purist, but it will work for many of us.
</P>
<P>
   But a quality brush is still the best way to go. Such a brush
will hold more paint, not show brush marks, and ease the tricky job
of ``cutting in'' _ painting the edge of a wall or ceiling without
getting paint where it is not supposed to be, and without using
masking tape.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where Benjamin Moore &AMP; Co. comes in. This company
has been making paints for 115 years, and finally has gotten into
the paintbrush (and roller) business, pushing high quality
applicators.
</P>
<P>
   And, in its inevitable promotion to push the new brushes, the
company produced a dandy bit of literature all about brushes.
</P>
<P>
   So, with no further fuss and feathers, here is what brushes are
all about.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded paintbrushes go back to AD 1300, when the
Phoenecians made them by twining wild boar hairs in the open end of
an animal horn. The boar hairs were the staple of brushes for more
than 600 years, until the synthetics came along, and boar or hog
bristles are still a principal part of some quality brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Most quality hog bristles come from China. China bristle has a
natural flex ideal for brushes, not too floppy and not too stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the old shampoo ads warning of the dreaded ``split
ends'' in hair? Well, split ends, called flags in bristles, are
important in brushes, helping to hold paint for easy application
and provide a smooth finish. The natural flags on bristle must be
manufactured on synthetic filaments.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are porous, natural bristles can absorb up to 40
percent of their own weight in water. After half an hour of
painting with latex paint, bristle brushes become too floppy for
use. For this reason, bristle is not recommended for use with
water-base paints. Bristle is also not recommended for rough
surfaces because the bristle and flags can break down and wear down
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So, bristle brushes are good for oil and alkyd paints, stains,
varnishes, urethanes and shellac. They are particulary good for
applying varnish, reducing brush marks, and providing a
super-smooth finish.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic filaments have been around since about World War II,
and have come a long way since. Most synthetics are nylon or
polyester, or a combination.
</P>
<P>
   Nylon brushes are durable, and clean up well. Although nylon
absorbs only 4 percent of its weight in water, it is not always the
best choice for long use with latex paints. They tend to get floppy
in heat. Polyester is inexpensive, and absorbs no moisture, but
retains its stiffness to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   So, nylon/polyester blends may be the best choice for all
paints: latex, acrylic, alkyd, and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the nitty gritty of painting, and there are, indeed,
tricks on applying paint:
</P>
<P>
   1. To fill the brush, dip it until it's half full. Tap it
lightly against the can to prevent dripping. Actually, tapping is
more important with varnish, to avoid bubbles. You can scrape the
brush against the can rim, if you like. There will be no problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sometimes scraping is a good idea, especially when you
have to carry the brush a distance to the work. That happens when
you are on the top of a ladder and have to transfer the loaded
brush from right hand to left to get to the work.
</P>
<P>
   2. Start at the top and work down. Paint in two-foot sections at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Overlap each section slightly. Brush from unpainted areas
into freshly painted ones. Finish with a light, lifting motion
toward the last wet edge to reduce brushmarks. Long, smooth strokes
produce a better finish than short, choppy ones.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't press too hard on the brush. This will distort the
brush and can break the filaments.
</P>
<P>
   Now all you have to do is clean up. And since you goofed last
time, leaving stiff, useless brushes good for nothing but throwing
away, you want to keep these quality brushes. So clean up!
</P>
<P>
   We also are aware that there are good brush cleaning and
unstiffening solvents you can use to revive dead brushes _ we just
don't want to.
</P>

`DECLINE III' STRESSES PUNKERS' ANGST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a moment when a young female character in ``The Decline
of Western Civilization Part III,'' a new documentary depicting the
lives of a group of homeless punk-rockers in Los Angeles,
alternately hangs a loogie down to her navel, flips off the camera,
and then returns to the careful up-do of hair-spikes in the
bathroom mirror. Because, as a girlfriend says, ``she still wants
to look pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   And one boy, barely 22 and sporting a mohawk, notes how his
father used to beat him, using ``everything from fists to power
tools,'' and when asked if he was still angry, comes close to
welling up.
</P>
<P>
   The footage encompasses everything we should to know about these
kids. Scary-looking as Freddy Krueger and as defiant as wolverines,
they are still, well, kids. They pose and bluster and even get
violent, but they are also victims of abuse, or rejected by parents
even more screwed up than they are, or born with addicts' genes.
You vacillate between wanting to arrest them and wanting to hug
them and take away their pain.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the third installment of Penelope Spheeris' trilogy is
hardly an uplifting way to spend an evening at the movies. But it
is occasionally powerful, thanks to excellent camera work (mosh pit
scenes are like being there), and always engrossing _ like watching
a train wreck in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   The first two chapters were far more fun to watch. 1981's
``Decline of Western Civilization'' captured the raw energy and
excitement of punk's early years in L.A.; and 1988's ``DWC II: The
Metal Years'' was a hilarious look at the new heavy metal scene _
and it's big-haired poseurs _ which punk had fought so hard to
reject.
</P>
<P>
   The third film, which premiered at Sundance and has had trouble
finding a distributor because it's so unrelentingly bleak, has in
comparison very little to do with the music around which its
denizens' lives revolve. Spheeris is more interested in the young
punkers as real people; for that she is to be applauded. Characters
in the first two films flitted by on the screen, giving us little
time to get inside their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But at times the film teeters on advocacy-journalism, a la
Michael Moore. During closing credits, it is noted that all
proceeds from the movie will be given to charities that assist
homeless young people. And throughout the interviews, Spheeris
posits questions to her young subjects like, ``What happened to
your eye?'' and ``When was the last time you took a bath?''
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible that she needed to earn their trust through
such maternal outbursts, it loses objectivity by showing sympathy
for the young losers. Don't forget, these kids also steal _ even
sell their dogs _ to buy beer.
</P>
<P>
   The film's unrelenting intensity would have been leavened by
more interviews from outsiders; as it was, there was only an
out-of-step nightclub owner, a fairly sympathetic cop, and one
mother who seemed more weird than her pierced-and-tattooed son. The
rest was all safety-pinned noses, young women passed out on
party-room floors, barfing in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   But after 90 minutes with the group, when an inevitable death
does occur, it hurts. Especially following footage of them
answering the question, ``What will you be doing in five years?''
Most answered, quite sincerely, ``I will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The music, supplied by such inconsequential bands as Final
Conflict, Litmus Green, Naked Aggression and The Resistance, is
pretty standard punk-club thrash: loud and screaming, with
occasional bursts of political venting. (Last year's ``Hype'' at
least featured bands that, while unknown, were at least enjoyable _
from Gas Huffer to the Fastbacks.)
</P>
<P>
   But Spheeris wasn't making a movie about music this time. She
wanted to open our eyes to the misery of these homeless kids. For
the most part, she succeeds admirably, but the impact would have
been greater if she'd stepped back from an advocate's role.

THE NEIGHBORS MOVE IN WITH US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The family across the street moved in with us last week. All the
floors in their house were being refinished, with the resulting
fumes, and so late on Monday afternoon they marched across the
street, suitcases in hand, and came to spend four days here.
</P>
<P>
   David, Patti, and their two children have been our neighbors for
12 years. Their porch fronts on our driveway, and so it's a pretty
rare week that we don't run into one another by the cars and engage
in the kind of small talk that makes you feel connected over time.
David goes outside to smoke and often, coming home after a night
out, Jack and I have lingered in the dark street, discussing the
state of the world with the glowing end of a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Matt, now 11, and Deenah, age 8, were 5 years old, my
husband's taken them with him once a month to prepare and serve
drinks at the Crombie Shelter in Salem. Matt and his dad use our
yard for pitching practice so I can easily look out of my office
window and watch Matt throw one right over the plate. Both kids
take part in the neighborhood skit I organize every Halloween, and
when I had an extra ticket this winter, I took Deenah to see
``Everest'' at the Omnimax. When the family's shed came down this
spring, their bikes temporarily moved into our garage. Suffice it
to say that when I left the house with my curling iron plugged in,
it was Patti I called to run over and shut it off.
</P>
<P>
   The folks across the street are more than neighbors, yet they're
not ``friend'' friends. They've never had dinner here. We've never
gone to a movie together. Patti and David are almost a generation
younger than we are, though that didn't occur to me until I began
to describe them here. Theirs is a family we know mostly through
casual observation, a family whose activities occasionally parallel
ours without intersecting. Because we don't have a word in the
English language to describe such a relationship, it's odd to
realize how fond of neighbors you can become without getting to
know them through the usual pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Still, living together was a big step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure it's OK if we move in?'' David asked Sunday
night, for about the 10th time. David and Patty were worried about
imposing on us. What they didn't realize was that I was worried
that someone in their extended family would grab them before I
could convince them that we were offering the most desirable
accommodations in town.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait. The thought of having a table full of folks at
meals, of hanging out together evenings, of hearing ``Good Night''
from every occupied bedroom, just like in the Waltons, thrilled me.
I like running into people in my own hallways. I like conversations
that accompany doing things together. I like no frills, no fuss
cohabitation. I must have lived in a boarding house in one of my
previous lives.
</P>
<P>
   I find it's easier to have folks move in than to have those very
same people over for dinner. When I'm solely in charge, even the
simplest meal requires at least half a day for buying food,
straightening the house, setting the table, and preparing the meal.
House guests, especially if they're neighbors, are a different
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably they become coproprietors.
</P>
<P>
   Patti did the food shopping. The kids set the table. Everyone
cleared. We cooked one meal over our Halloween bonfire pit. I
didn't wash a dish the whole time they were here. Instead we
lingered over meals, listening to Matt's concerns about global
warming, and Deenah's report about her part in a summer production
of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Watching videos together, I felt
the ease of a camaraderie that came about without the adults having
a single heart-to-heart talk.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that this brief respite from 10 nerve-racking
months of renovations took the sting out of the fact that Patti and
David's electrician vanished before he got around to putting lights
in their bedroom. Perhaps it dampened the frustration they're
feeling because the man who built their kitchen cabinets won't come
to install the doors. And perhaps this brief trip away from home
deserves some credit for the fact that Patti stayed cool when she
discovered that the workmen had left hardened pools of varnish on
several floors. (Not to worry. They came back and redid it.)
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors come your way by chance. Some of them grow on you in
gradual, almost imperceptible increments. This is the best part
about getting close to them. When it's time to go home, they don't
go far.

LET THE SUN SHINE IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bouts of cloudy weather this spring and summer have
not exactly turned people's thoughts to solar power. If, indeed,
people think solar. Why bother when the oil truck comes when
called? That attitude may be about to change. Following last
winter's conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, President
Clinton has committed America to installing 1 million solar roofs
by 2010. &UR;  &LR; There are two good reasons: Solar power is inexhaustible
and doesn't pollute.
</P>
<P>
   But do we want our houses to look as though we lived solar?
</P>
<P>
   New technology and good design should make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   What makes today's solar roofing different from the old
hot-water panels on the homes of solar pioneers is the way they are
integrated into the structure. That shiny black cladding that gives
enormous chic to the tower of 4 Times Square, New York City's new
environmentally friendly skyscraper, is really an electronic device
called photovoltaics (PV) that converts sunlight into electricity.
The same PV, sensitively used on a little dormer Cape Cod or a big,
turreted Queen Anne Victorian, will trap enough sun to light the
house and then some. You could use the surplus to run your lawn
mower. You could also import a solar mower (from Sweden) that's as
cute as a June bug.
</P>
<P>
   For an entertaining and enlightening picture of how this works,
go see a show called ``Under the Sun: An Outdoor Exhibition of
Light'' at the Cooper-Hewitt, the Smithsonian Institution's
national museum of design, through Oct. 25. Housed in the old
Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st St., the Cooper-Hewitt boasts the
biggest, poshest back yard in Manhattan: Fifth Avenue runs along
the edge and the sun sets behind Central Park. Each year during the
warm weather, the museum uses the lawn for a show about outdoor
living. One year it was dog houses and another year, tents. When it
was lawn furniture, a chicken-wire structure planted with ivy
turned into a topiary armchair. This year, the star turn is Old
Sol.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened appropriately on the summer solstice and the
weather cooperated. Not so the following day: It did not exactly
pour rain but neither did the sun appear. Yet there was light
enough to power each of the exhibits. Amelia Amon's solar fountain
trickled water and Nicholas Goldsmith's sun clock told time. As
show curator Lucy Fellowes explained to a sun seeker from Boston,
sun bounces off clouds even on a cloudy day. A sun meter that
Fellowes consulted registered well under 10 percent but when she
covered the sun trap with her hand _ to simulate night _ the dial
went blank.
</P>
<P>
   Solar power in its latest manifestation is like a bank. If your
house (or business) is connected to the local power grid, you sell
your excess solar energy to the utility during the day. During heat
waves, when there is demand for air conditioning, utilities are
glad for the spare power. At night, or on a cloudy day, you
withdraw power from your solar account. (For people who live far
from a power grid, solar power is stored in a battery about the
size of a modern oil furnace.) The solar capital of Massachusetts
may be the the north-central city of Gardner, Mass., otherwise the
Chair Capital of the World. A whole neighborhood of 30 houses have
had their roofs retrofitted by Solar Design Associates of Harvard,
Mass. to cash in on sun power. The firm also did City Hall and the
library as well as a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing homes since the 1980s,'' Marilyn Strong,
Solar Design's vice president, said in a telephone interview. ``Our
houses are all over the country.'' They include two in Brookline,
Mass. and another in Milton, Mass. So convinced of sun power are a
third client, William and Deborah Lord, that their solar home in
Kennebunk, Maine, has its own Web site: www.solarhouse.com.
Designed by Steven Strong, the Lord house delivers dependable
electricity at low cost, something under $10 a month during the
winter, the Lords estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Few houses will want or need the sun-trapping cladding on 4
Times Square. But when PVs mimic asphalt roofing tile, the
application to domestic housing is vast. ``We try to incorporate
PVs so it looks like part of the roof rather than sitting on it,
like the old solar-heated hot water panels. If your house is smoky
gray,'' said Strong, ``a roof of black PVs would look quite nice.''
The PVs for one of the Brookline homes, as well as the Kennebunk
house, are bright blue, formed from crystals. ``Typically black or
blue absorbs the spectrum of light that's most efficient for
conversion,'' says Strong.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind PVs goes back to 1839, when a French
scientist named Edmund Pecquerel discovered the ability of silicon
to convert sunlight to electricity. As silicon is the most
plentiful element on earth after oxygen, it's available worldwide.
But the practical application of Becquerel's discovery had to wait
till 1954 when scientists at Bell Laboratories rediscovered PVs and
used them as a power source for rural telephone systems. Space
satellites began using PVs in 1958. PV cells run traffic signals
and street lights.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cooper-Hewitt show, the structures are a good deal more
fanciful than the Gardner neighborhood of post-World War II homes.
A sleek pavilion is the work of two New York-based architects,
Gregory Kiss (pronounced Kish) of Kiss &AMP; Cathcart Architects and
Nicholas Goldsmith of FTL Happold Architects &AMP; Engineers. This
consists of glass panels onto which a fine film of black PVs has
been applied. To show the variety of the product, some panels are
solid and others are scored with fine lines, which reduce somewhat
the solar receptivity. Each panel has a small red junction box from
which wires flow. Kiss likens the pavilion to a little powerhouse.
While architects of skyscrapers and commercial buildings will use
such rigid panels as curtain walls, Kiss thinks there is
application to the home market. ``For a sun room or a Florida
room,'' he said. The panels can themselves be paneled on the
interior: Glass, being porous, is not a good insulator.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss's pavilion consists of 54 panels of clear and photovoltaic
glass. Each costs about $120 (for a total of almost $6,500), half
what they did five years ago. Kiss thinks the cost will drop
further. His configuration of PV panels could supply electricity
needs for a 2,500-square-foot house.
</P>
<P>
   A true believer in solar power, curator Fellowes overstates
matters to say that ``every civilization except ours has built with
the sun.'' That is to ignore the siting of old Yankee farmhouses to
trap light and warmth, or conversely, banish heat. But she is on
the mark about the portability of the sun as a power source. ``It
comes to you,'' she said as drizzle fell on the Cooper-Hewitt lawn.
``You don't need ships and oil tankers.''
</P>
<P>
   And there as proof was one of Goldsmith's elegant white tents,
soaring over the show like a great bird. Even in the drizzle, the
mast of the solar tent registered a few light rays. To make this
tent a solar receptor, Goldsmith ran PVs in the form of a flexible
film that followed the swooping contours of the tenting material.
The lesson here is solar power for portable buildings. A helicopter
could drop a tent in a disaster area. ``You could set it up for
emergency shelter,'' curator Fellowes says. ``You could use tents
for hospitals or schools.'' The more PV strips a tent had, the more
sun it trapped. ``You certainly would generate enough power for
lighting, and for modest refrigeration,'' Fellowes said.
</P>
<P>
   Solar power interests Indonesia, a country of islands with
little in the way of a power grid. For the country's PT Sudimara
Energi Surya, Paul Hessels has designed a table that houses the
battery for home power while doubling as the television console.
And when the sun shines, as someday it will, the mind will turn to
solar for ... laptops (in the Siemens version the receptor is the
cover and the hinge conceals the battery) and for ... food cookers
(made of coated cardboard by the California design firm of Bernard,
Kerr, Pejack, Campbell) and for ... handheld lanterns (by designer
Hedda Beese and engineer Charles Ash). That cute green lawn mower
by Sweden's Andre Colens is also robotic. Its range is 13,000
square feet of lawn. It begins working in the morning and quits at
dusk. The idea is to maintain lawns much as grazing animals did,
trimming little but often.
</P>
<P>
   Many civilizations worshipped the sun and Goldsmith's Solar
Council clock is a nod to that. Arranged in a big circle are what
purport to be chairs, and are, but tall and angular, as though
Frank Lloyd Wright was trying his hand at patio or pool furniture.
Topping each chair is a fat metal bun. This is a reading light. For
light summer reading at night. Solar powered, of course. The chairs
number 12, each marking an hour on a solar clock. One is a sundial:
When you stand in the center, you are the gnomon or marker that
casts the time-telling shadow. Sundials, as they are wont to say,
``mark only sunny hours.'' But there was Goldsmith's analog clock.
The rain, it raineth evermore, but little colored lights winked
around the circle of chairs. Red stands for the hour, amber for the
minute, and blue for the second. As Chairman Clinton says: Let a
million sunroofs bloom.

75 YEARS OF UNDERESTIMATING CALVIN COOLIDGE

   Seventy-five years ago this week, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in
as the 30th president of the United States. The anniversary has not
gone unmarked. In Boston, the John F. Kennedy Library hosted 600
historians, educators, and amateur scholars for a superb two-day
conference on Coolidge's life and times. Robert Sobel's absorbing
new biography, ``Coolidge: An American Enigma,'' has just been

   That night, back in 1923, was one of high drama. As President
Harding lay dying in San Francisco, Vice President Coolidge was
visiting his father and stepmother in the lonely Vermont village
where he had grown up. There was no electricity in the house, no
plumbing, no telephone. Light came from a kerosene lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Harding's death reached White River Junction, the
nearest large town, by telegram. By the time someone got the news
to Plymouth Notch, it was extremely late. John Coolidge, the vice
president's father, answered the knock at the door. In a trembling
voice he called upstairs to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coolidge and his wife returned to the bedroom,'' Sobel writes.
``They washed, dressed, and knelt by the bed to pray. Then they
went downstairs, where Coolidge dictated a message of sympathy to
Mrs. Harding. The house was now crowded with reporters and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general urged Coolidge to take the oath of office
without delay. He ``went across the street to the general store and
telephoned Secretary of State (Charles Evans) Hughes, who informed
him the oath could be administered by a notary. Coolidge told
Hughes his father was a notary. Coolidge returned home, and in the
downstairs sitting room John Coolidge, using the family Bible,
swore his son in as president. The time was 2:47 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The modesty of Coolidge's inauguration befit his style. He was a
frugal man, with words no less than with money. Indeed, about all
he is popularly remembered for is his reticence. As the story goes,
the matron seated next to him at dinner said that she had wagered
she could get the famously nontalkative president to say more than
three words, to which Coolidge replied: ``You lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably never happened. But he didn't believe in wasting
words. In a profile written when he was still governor of
Massachusetts, the New York World called Coolidge ``a sphinx.'' He
``talks little,'' the paper noted. ``It is his silences which seem
to speak loudest, for when one ventures to put a question to him,
the answer comes in a tightening of the governor's lean face and
the closing of his lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he wasn't shy when he had something to say. He delivered
more speeches than any of his predecessors. He held 520 press
conferences. He was the first president to address the nation by
radio, and did so about once a month, paving the way for FDR's
``fireside chats.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was a superb politician. He stands as one of the
great vote-getters in Massachusetts history _ he was elected state
representative, state senator, lieutenant governor, and governor _
and one of the most popular men ever to run for president. After
finishing Harding's term, he was elected in his own right in a
landslide in 1924. A second full term would have been his for the
asking. Never, perhaps, has anyone been so admired while in the
White House _ and so disdained afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's reputation plummeted after 1929 because the first
reviews of his career were written by hostile New Deal historians.
Lionizing Franklin Roosevelt for sharply expanding the role of the
federal government in Americans' lives, they painted the
conservative Coolidge by contrast as a do-nothing who had failed to
foresee the Depression. Unable to defend himself _ he died in 1933
_ Coolidge slipped from the ranks of the nation's most esteemed
figures to the level of its most disparaged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, belatedly, his fine record is getting the clear look it
deserves. The first hint of a Coolidge rehabilitation came in 1981,
when the Ronald Reagan ordered Coolidge's portrait to take the
place of Harry Truman's in the Cabinet Room. At the Kennedy Library
conference, Time columnist Hugh Sidey recalled the buzz that went
through the press corps when the Coolidge painting appeared.
Reporters thought the custodian must have fetched the wrong
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   But Reagan's instincts were solid. As Robert D. Novak, the
veteran political commentator, puts it, Coolidge's ``personal
integrity, faith in the market system, and concern for the ordinary
citizen'' made him ``the model of American conservatism.'' His
White House years were distinguished not only by unstained honesty,
but by a fierce drive to reduce taxes and slash the national debt.
Coolidge was the last president until Reagan who grasped in his
bones the importance of limiting government. ``It is much more
important,'' he insisted, ``to kill bad bills than to pass good
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, modest, careful, the thoughtful New Englander raised to
the presidency in that hasty ceremony 75 years ago turns out to
have been one of the most honorable public servants ever to hold
the job. What a pity that he has gone so long without the credit he
deserves. What a blessing it would be to have his like in the White
House again.

CYBERMEDICINE: AN UNHEALTHY ALTERNATIVE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patients come from all over the world for treatment
by Dr. Steven Kohler, an emergency room physician at Salem (Mass.)
Hospital. It is a very speedy trip. All they have to do is log on
and tell the doctor where it hurts _ by electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   From their office on the Internet, Kohler and fellow Salem
Hospital physician Kerry Archer have been diagnosing ailments and
prescribing medication for two years to people around the globe.
Now, a host of doctors are rushing on-line, prompting questions
about whether Internet medicine is good medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, a lot of doctors said this is heresy,''
Kohler said. ``But as time goes on, doctors and more of the public
will see this as a significant aspect of the practice of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler calls it the ``virtual housecall.'' A woman on vacation
contracts a urinary tract infection, and she needs an antibiotic. A
man on a business trip has a relapse of asthma, and he wants an
inhaler. Kohler says these are typical, minor ailments that can be
evaluated in the live, person-to-person electronic exchanges
offered for $50 by his Internet site, called CyberDocs
(www.cyberdocs.com).
</P>
<P>
   The potential for ``cybermedicine'' could be huge. It is a
low-cost way to match doctors with patients, 24 hours a day,
whether the patient lives in remotest Alaska or crowded Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   At the Physician Insurers Association of America, which
represents malpractice insurers, an official says she has received
at least a dozen inquiries from doctors in the last six months
about setting up sites like Cyberdocs. Relatively low overhead
costs make it an attractive business prospect: Kohler says he and
Archer have spent about $80,000 on their site, and that it has
begun to break even. They claim 20 to 30 consultations weekly, with
about 90 percent involving a request for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But cybermedicine also raises a thicket of red flags. Can
doctors really treat patients they have never seen? Will patients
try to obtain drugs they do not need? Will doctors practice in
areas where they have no expertise?
</P>
<P>
   And, given that patients sometimes misreport their own symptoms,
how can Kohler and Archer trust what a patient is saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, people are putting themselves at risk to access
health care this way,'' said Dr. Thomas Reardon, president-elect of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This service would definitely raise an eyebrow,'' said
Jonathan Linkous, executive director of the American Telemedicine
Association, which promotes greater access to health care through
phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something here that could be very, very great, or it
could be terribly misused, and this needs to be sorted out,'' said
Dr. Nancy Auer, president of the American College of Emergency
Physicians. ``In the meantime, I think it's a case of `let the
buyer beware.'''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been mixing medicine and telecommunications for
years. A patient in California can have his heart monitored or his
X-rays read by a doctor in Boston, with the data moving in real
time over the phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies often ask clients to take their after-hours
questions to 800-lines staffed by nurses, creating the new field of
``tele-nursing.'' And Web sites offer information on every
imaginable medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, doctors are using the Internet to extend their
practices. At Cyberspace Telemedical Office (www.telemedical.com),
computer users can tap into a medical library, shop for health
products or arrange a conference with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   From his group practice in Beverly Hills, Calif., cardiologist
Ronald Karlsberg and his colleagues use a Web page (www.cvmg.com)
to advertise their service of offering case reviews for patients
with heart ailments. Unlike CyberDocs, Karlsberg talks to patients
by phone and obtains their medical records on paper.
</P>
<P>
   At CyberDocs, a patient who requests a ``virtual housecall''
automatically pages one of the site's doctors on call, telling the
doctor to log on for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The patient describes his or her symptoms and provides a medical
history. The doctor asks questions to make sure that the ailment is
not something serious, which might require in-person care. If
necessary, Kohler and Archer prescribe medication, using a separate
Internet service to arrange for quick delivery to almost anywhere
on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They offer prescriptions for baldness. They offer the ``morning
after pill'' for women who may have become pregnant. They have
written about 50 prescription for Viagra, but only for patients
located outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things that Kohler says CyberDocs will not do: It
will not prescribe narcotics, Valium or diet pills. He said it
offers only short-term prescriptions for drugs that require close
monitoring, like blood-pressure medication. And because CyberDocs
doctors are only licensed to practice in Massachusetts, they work
only with people who say they are checking in from Massachusetts or
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several medical trade groups said the future of
CyberDocs and related sites will hinge on how regulators and
insurance companies handle several key issues, such as whether
special licenses will be needed to provide service.
</P>
<P>
   Malpractice insurance could become another issue. Kohler said
that after walking his insurer through his Web service, the company
said his current malpractice policy would cover his on-line
doctoring, with no additional premium. But other insurers may fear
that they are taking on greater risks in tele-medicine, and they
may demand higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers set different malpractice premiums for each medical
specialty based on its history of pay-outs. ``But with this kind of
tele-medicine, there is no experience from a claims standpoint to
know how safe or risky this is,'' said Lori Bartholomew of the
Physician Insurers Association of America, the insurers trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating matters, malpractice premiums vary by region.
Insurers charge twice as much for a policy in Philadelphia than in
Pittsburgh, even though both are large cities in the same state,
with comparable medical schools and hospitals. ``Maybe Philadelphia
has tougher juries or a more litigious clientelle, but insurers
have a different experience of losses in one city than the other,''
Bartholomew said.
</P>
<P>
   With cybermedicine and similar services, insurers are being
asked to cover physicians who are practicing by Internet not only
across the country, but around the world. Setting premiums could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CyberDocs has some people asking whether a doctor
can treat a patient he has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are short of breath, I can see if your fingernails or
lips are turning blue,'' said Auer of the American College of
Emergency Physicians. ``I can see if you're breaking out in a
sweat. This helps me decide how serious your case is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler responds that CyberDocs does not want to treat patients
who have acute problems or need ongoing care, and that it tells
those clients to see a doctor in person. But at the same time,
there are many medical problems that doctors and patients tackle
together over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler plans to expand his roster of doctors to all 50 states,
and to add a videoconferencing service so that patients and doctors
can see each other. A psychiatrist will soon come on board for
on-line counseling, though CyberDocs is wary so far of prescribing
Prozac or other anti-depression medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential here is enormous,'' Kohler said by phone. He
then interrupted himself. ``I see another patient signing on,'' he
said. It was a regular client who obtains hair-loss medication from
CyberDocs. ``Luckily,'' Kohler said, ``it's Dr. Archer who is on
call tonight.''

MAULING NOT NEW FOR MANY BAY STATE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The bear is in our back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market analysts and money managers agree this week has
surely been hard on blue chip stocks, but they also point out that
the vast majority of other stocks have been struggling for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of drooping local stocks should convince you they are
right.
</P>
<P>
   We examined the stock price activity of 176 public companies
based in Massachusetts, each with a market value of at least $100
million. It wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Among that group, 121, or more than two out of every three
companies, fit the technical definition of a market correction.
Those stocks had all fallen at least 20 percent from the highest
levels achieved over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking, one of every four stocks in the group had
fallen at least 50 percent from their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hardest hit suffered from maladies common to
companies vulnerable to a downturn: unexpected
earnings &UR;  &LR; disappointments, stocks on the wrong side of erratic
price swings, or exposure to the Asian crisis. Most of them are
relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   But several other stocks came with no particular black mark or
special circumstance, simply sucked down by a worried market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sentiment to turn these (small-capitalization
stocks) at the moment,'' said Warren Isabelle of Ironwood Capital
in Boston, which specializes in small-company value stocks.
``People have just abandoned these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. enjoyed a good day
Wednesday, gaining 2 7/8 to 43. But the stock is still down by 26
percent from its 52-week high reached just a month ago, despite
backing from analysts at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette who recently
named it a ``top pick'' and at CIBC Oppenheimer who have boosted
its rating to a ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners isn't so small, with a stock
market value of $2.4 billion, but it fit a familiar pattern. The
only recent news out of the technology consulting company: It met,
but did not beat, profit expectations when it announced quarterly
earnings three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Lexington, down 85.8 percent
from its peak, was the biggest single loser. The company was trying
to recover from its Redux problems when it decided to withdraw
regulatory applications for an important stroke-recovery drug in
April, prompting a one-day, 50 percent cut in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   PRI Automation Inc. of Billerica, which makes semiconductor test
equipment, got caught in the Asia economic spiral. Its stock has
sunk steadily from 58 1/2 in September to 13 7/8 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the leading Internet stocks in Massachusetts have taken
their lumps in the unpredictable market for Web companies, but only
after reaching dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover has slumped from a peak
of 85 7/8 reached last month to 67 11/16 Wednesday. But that is
still far ahead of the stock's average price of nearly 28 11/16
recorded over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. of Waltham, an Internet search company, has plunged
from a high of 99 9/16 to Wednesday's close of 53 3/8 in a matter
of a month.
</P>
<P>
   Small-stock investors see lots of cheap investments today, even
if they are unsure when the market will rediscover those companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unitrode Corp. of Merrimack, N.H., which would have joined our
bear market list if it were located in Massachusetts, is a favorite
of David Diamond at High Rock Capital in Boston, another small-cap
value manager who invests about $525 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unitrode shares have sunk from a high of 41 13/16 last fall to
14 1/8 as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks dominated the group of sinking Massachusetts
issues, but several larger companies also took their lumps.
</P>
<P>
   Teradyne Inc. of Boston, another semiconductor test equipment
company with business in Asia, gave up more than 63 percent of its
peak price set last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok International Ltd., the struggling sneaker company based
in Stoughton, was off more than 60 percent from its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Even BankBoston Corp., one of the region's most successful
stocks last year, has slumped 21 percent from its peak reached a
month ago.

LOCAL TV NEWS A BLOODY SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only a one-day snapshot, but the Rocky Mountain Media
Watch's examination of the night newscasts on 102 local television
stations March 11 revealed that no news succeeds like bad news,
particularly if it's bloody. (Earlier this year, the nonprofit RMMW
unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to
revoke the license of four Denver TV stations on the grounds that
their crime-drenched news was detrimental to the public interest.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the RMMW report released Tuesday, crime stories
consumed 27 percent of the local news airtime, followed by coverage
of disasters such as floods, fires, and crashes, at 12 percent.
News about health, the economy, and government averaged about 10
percent of the airtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a successful business model to present the tabloid''
version of news, said RMMW executive director Paul Klite. There
was, however, at least one exception in the Boston market, where
RMMW surveyed WBZ-Ch. 4, WHDH-Ch. 7, and New England Cable News.
NECN was cited as one of only four stations nationally that
presented ``quality programs that provide empowering information to
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Klite, the day on which RMMW surveyed the stations
``was a slow news day'' in which cold weather dominated many
newscasts. In addition, 27 of the 102 stations carried California
video of a horse, stuck in the mud, that had to be rescued by a
helicopter; about half the stations ran stories abut the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, though there were no new developments; nearly
half the stations had footage of a hostage situation at a Seattle
bank; and almost 20 carried stories about a possible asteroid
collision with earth. Not much nutritional value there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of vindication at the new on-line Conservative
News Service last month. On June 16, CNS _ a division of the Media
Research Center _ featured a story about a Miami investigation
involving a $120,000 contribution to the Democratic National
Committee. Four days later, that information made it into a story
in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of four reporters and two editors, the month-old
CNS (www.conservativenews.org) hopes to function as a news service
that remedies some of the ``shortcomings in much of the American
news media.'' To wit: the liberal bias that the group says pervades
the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it the Conservative News Service because we wanted
to make sure self-identified conservatives know this is news they
will be interested in,'' said CNS executive editor Scott Hogenson.
But ``we also look for stories that are underreported or ignored by
the establishment media.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the news service catches on, the on-line site has
already begun to attract a solid conservative following. Last week,
visitors were asked to vote on whether a sitting president should
be required to testify if subpoenaed before a federal grand jury in
a criminal inquiry. The final tally was 1,282 yes and 33 no votes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Exhibit A in the case against the news media. Word of a
stained garment that might confirm a sexual relationship between
President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky _ a story that bounced
around in January from cyber gossip Matt Drudge to ABC's Jackie
Judd to much of the mainstream media _ was considered a classic
example of unsourced gossip-mongering that characterized much of
the reporting on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia Journalism Review characterized the story as a
candidate for the ``sleaziest report award.'' The American
Journalism Review cited it as one of the ``many juicy but
unconfirmed tidbits (that) took on the aura of fact.'' And in his
scathing assault on the media's reporting of ``Monica-gate'' in his
new magazine, Steven Brill used the dress story to illustrate
journalistic malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the dress has resurfaced as a potentially crucial
element in the case, some observers believe the media critics may
need their own watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think there is a lesson,'' said Bob Steele, the
director of the Ethics Program at the Poynter Institute for Media
Studies. ``In terms of critiquing and watchdogging ourselves, we
need to apply the same high standards that we ask of the
journalists we're challenging. Some of the criticism in this case
has been of the self-serving, bell-ringing `those idiots' nature.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One ubiquitous feature of Boston's burgeoning Irish pub scene is
the so-called ``Green Paper'' known as The Irish Emigrant. The
outgrowth of an e-mail newsletter that was begun by a Digital
Equipment employee in Galway, the South Boston-based Emigrant now
distributes about 8,000 local copies of the 64-page weekly, mostly
to local pubs and shops, where it has become a hot item.
</P>
<P>
   Part of its appeal is the listing of local Irish pubs and
restaurants, the Irish Calendar, and the Irish Pages version of the
Yellow Pages. But about 75 percent of the news comes from Ireland _
and where else could you read about a Newry couple who died in a
fire resulting from ``an unattended chip pan'' or how an injury to
star player Dara O'Cinneide proved crucial in the Kerry football
championship?

MUCH EARLY RYDER INTEREST AMONG PUBLIC, CORPORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup has become the area's talking topic, and between
the corporate world and the general public, there is plenty to talk
about. The latest news is that the PGA of America has bowed to the
weight of public opinion and agreed to refund the controversial $5
application fee for the random drawing for tickets to the event,
which will be played next September at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The fee will be refunded regardless of whether a person's name
is drawn. This is a good public relations decision, since many
balked at paying a $5 fee that was not refundable. The prepared
statement issued by the PGA of America read simply, ``After a
discussion with the Office of the Florida Attorney General, the PGA
made the decision to refund all shipping and handling fees for
processing ticket requests.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 25,000 paid requests for entry into the drawing,
with 30,000 tickets available. There has been a little lull in the
rush for tickets, but news that the obligatory $5 fee has been
rescinded should stimulate interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate getting a rush before the Aug. 31 deadline,''
said tournament director Dan Baker. ``People tend to wait. I'm sure
with the PGA Championship being played next week, people will start
talking Ryder Cup. This is one of the biggest sporting events in
the world. There's discussions on the players, the captain's
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the PGA of America decision to rescind the fee, Baker
said, ``They felt we hadn't done anything wrong, but they wanted to
take a close look at it ... and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of activity Wednesday at The Country Club _
work on the locker room building the teams will be sharing next
September is in progress. ``We're focusing on the facility,
transportation, and presenting the best golf course we can,'' said
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup has become big business, especially since the
Europeans upended the US team last year in Valderrama on Sprin's
Andalucia coastline and two years prior to that at Oak Hill in the
suburbs of Rochester, Mich.

<P>
   Boston will have the 103d Boston Marathon next year, plus
baseball's All-Star Game and Davis Cup tennis matches. The Ryder
Cup should eclipse all of them in terms of international interest
and financial involvement.
</P>
<P>
   This competition began innocently enough at Worcester Country
Club in 1927 _ there are plans to invite '27 US team member Gene
Sarazen next year. He was still active as an honorary starter at
the Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
   The United States dominated the competition when it was between
American golfers and their counterparts from Greater Britain and,
later, from Great Britain and Ireland. Since the Europeans came in
as a group in 1979, and players such as Seve Ballesteros, Nick
Faldo, Jose Maria Olazabal, Bernhard Langer, and Ian Woosnam
blossomed, it's been a different game. The Europeans won at The
Belfry in 1985 and repeated at Muirfield Village in 1987, their
first win on US turf.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1985 tournament, it's been a wild, woolly, and
wonderful competition, with the Europeans holding a 4-2-1 edge. And
the corporate community has taken notice of the increased
international interest. More than 2 1/2 years before the first tee
shot of the Ryder Cupo, there were 57 corporate tents sold,
bringing in $15.2 million. There had been no announcement of their
availability, no marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, two more have been sold, and additional corporate
tent availibility is being made available on the adjacent Putterham
Meadows, with the first $3 million in revenue going to the town of
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic goals now are on parking and transportation,'' said
Baker. ``We'll park some cars at Putterham, but we'll basically
shuttle more people in to alleviate any congestion in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest to become involved is International Management Group,
which has reached an agreement with Brae Burn CC to hold a golfing
event hosted by Arnold Palmer and featuring other IMG-represented
golfers. Groups of 10 can pay $40,000 to play a round _ four of the
10 on Thursday with an IMG client, the remaining six from the group
on Friday. The $40,000 package includes breakfast, lunch, a
reception, and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clients,'' said Bev Norwood of IMG, ``depends on who is on
the Ryder Cup team and who's not playing somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   There also will be golf lessons available from guru David
Ledbetter and tennis lessons from Nick Bolletteiri.
</P>
<P>
   Even Norwood is amazed by the scope of the Ryder Cup. ``It used
to be players wanted to make the Ryder Cup team to indicate they
had a good year,'' he said. ``Now they want to play in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz Sports &AMP; Media of Atlanta has rented Winchester CC and
Belmont CC, and groups ranging from Pepsi, State Street Bank, and
the Boston Globe/Golf Digest have signed on. ``Everything is going
well,'' said company president Will Katz. ``We've signed on a
number of clients. People have heard of the golf courses. We're
getting great feedback. The activity level is still big, and all
the hospitality is sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the approach of BankBoston, which has spent $500,000
for a priority hospitality tent on site and $500,000 to rent
Charles River CC Tuesday through Saturday. This doesn't include
food or beverage, or the cost of flying in clients from Europe and
Latin America. BsnkBoston paid $250,000 up front a year ago
September, and the remaining $250,000 is due next month _ a year
before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Helps soften the blow of refurbishing the clubhouse, doesn't it?

IN CAMBRIDGE, IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE

 &QL;
<P>
   I love living in Cambridge for so many reasons, many of them
wrong, I suppose, according to the Chamber of Commerce. But I love
it just the same.
</P>
<P>
   It's an incredibly tolerant city, as long as you're a liberal.
It's one of the world capitals of eccentricity. It's so many other
things. A smoke-free zone. A nuclear-free zone. A domestic
violence-free zone. A prejudice-free zone. A drug-free zone. Have I
forgotten anything? A fat-free zone? Not yet. But it may be just a
matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a town with principles, a town that, for example, is not
afraid to reach out across the globe to support the people of East
Timor in their struggle against Indonesian oppression. Last week,
the City Council voted not to purchase goods or services from
companies that sell military equipment to Indonesia or that
prospect or drill for oil or natural gas in the Timor Gap.
</P>
<P>
   That ought to bring the Indonesian government to its knees. But
I support my City Council's courageous action on the East Timor
situation, although I wonder just how much impact the ban will
have, especially when a Cambridge Chronicle story reports that the
prohibition won't apply if a particular good or service is deemed
``necessary to protect or preserve the health, safety or welfare of
the the public'' or if ``no comparable product is available without
incurring substantial additional costs or suffering substantial
decrease in quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a nice gesture. It's the thought that counts. You
don't see them passing a resolution like that in any other city or
town around here. You'd have to go all the way to Northampton or
Brattleboro to find a place that thinks as globally and acts as
locally as Cambridge. That's one of the things I love about it. But
there are so many things to love. It's multicultural, multiethnic,
multireligious, multigenerational, multisexual, multipurpose. I
can't imagine living anywhere else. All this and the Red Line too.
No wonder people are clamoring to live in Cambridge, throwing great
piles of money at even the unlikeliest-looking real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republik of Cambridge. That image of Cambridge is
fading fast. Someday soon the only trace of it may be the bar of
the same name in Central Square. Right now Cambridge is less like a
People's Republik and more like some economically booming Eastern
Bloc country after the Berlin Wall came down. Everybody wants a
piece of the action, except for the people who can't afford to live
in Cambridge anymore. I watch the mall-ing of Central Square and
wonder how long it will be before it goes the way of Harvard
Square, which more and more resembles Disney World. A great place
to visit but you wouldn't want to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my neighbors have lived in the same houses 40, 50, 70
years, all their lives. Now people like me are moving in and
changing the character of the neighborhood. But who could blame
people for wanting to live on my street? It's a real neighborhood
with families (including families of raccoons and skunks) where
kids play in the street and everybody is civil to one another, most
of the time. How long will it stay that way?
</P>
<P>
   The thing I like best about living where I do is that I never
know what I'll see when I walk out my front door and head to
Central Square. One day it was a flier nailed to a utility pole
inviting one and all to a ``potluck supper and crime update.''
Another day it was a bus full of singing socialists about to embark
on a pilgrimage to Cuba. And one day I saw the Fringe Voice
himself, walking down my street. The star of a local cable TV show
of the same name, the Fringe Voice finds conspiracies everywhere. A
favorite theme is that President Kennedy is alive. On one memorable
show, he connected the late president with Nicole Simpson and Ron
Goldman, saying, with studied irony, ``I'm suggesting that Nicole
and Ronald are as dead as President Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with that, but why would anybody try? It's
Cambridge.

STAMPED CONCRETE GAINS POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to get rid of a long concrete walk from the porch to
the driveway, and maybe put in some brick. A landscaper suggested
using stamped concrete, a technique of applying new concrete and
stamping or forming it into a pattern of brick, stone, or other
stylish paving. Would this work?
</P>
<P>
   TOM O'NEILL, North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Such a concrete treatment can work, and can look pretty good.
It's new, but there are several outfits who are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the operators who do it with newly laid concrete are
Decorative Concrete of Whitman, Mass., phone 781-447-9444 or
800-236-1322; Concrete Impressions of Center Harbor, N.H., phone
603-536-1650, ext. 112; and Increte Systems by N.E. Decorative
Concrete of Northwood, N.H., phone 603-942-9273 or 800-972-9273.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an outfit, CTI New England of Groton, Conn., phone
800-737-4284, which resurfaces old concrete with a pattern and
colors.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put in brick instead, that too is possible, right
on top of the old concrete. But instead of mortaring it onto the
old concrete, you could do this: Drill holes in the concrete for
drainage, set up borders along each side to contain the brick, and
install brick dry (not with mortar). This will raise the walk, but
it will provide a good, no-maintenance brick surface. I think it
would be better than trying to mortar in the brick, but you do need
that border.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the border of pressure-treated timbers, 2 x 8s or 2
x 10s, concrete patio blocks, or soldier bricks, i.e. bricks on
their long ends.
</P>
<P>
   A final possibility, still using the borders, is to regrade the
earth against the new walk so that the walk is flush with the earth
instead of sticking up 2 or 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The outside stairs of the Victorian building I live in are
brownstone, and I'd like to make them less slippery. Paint with
sand added just doesn't stick to them. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   ELI SEGEV, Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I really don't think there is much you can do to make them
less slippery without using a paint, which will hold added sand
quite readily. I haven't heard that brownstone (sandstone, quite
soft and absorbent) is a problem with slipperiness.
</P>
<P>
   You could try using a brown semitransparent stain, and
sprinkling sand in it when it is still wet, but I don't think it
will be satisfactory. You could try this: Use a solid brown latex
stain, and brush it well into the stone, then sprinkle sand on it
while it is still wet. Solid color stains are not supposed to be
used on horizontal surfaces (it will not stand up and can peel) but
it might work if you really brush the stain in.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the antiskid appliques, self-adhesive strips with
a sandpaper top will work, because they won't stick to the
sandstone. If they become loose, even after being glued, they could
be a hazard on stairs.
</P>
<P>
   A final idea is to glue on dark brown indoor-outdoor carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband wants to replace all the windows in a stucco
house, where the wood casing is punky and won't hold paint, and to
insulate the walls. Is that feasible with a stucco house? The
stucco is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   S.J., Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is feasible, but instead of replacing the windows (if the
sash _ the movable parts _ is in good shape), why not replace just
the casing, the frame around the window opening? Some building
stores carrry such casing, which is tongued and grooved at the
connecting points to allow it to sit properly and evenly on the
stucco. The handyman did this in his old house, and although the
siding is not stucco, the new casing is easily painted or stained.
Even if you can't get the specially designed casing, you can make
square-edged boards work.
</P>
<P>
   As for insulating a stucco house, it is best done from the
inside. It is easier to drill holes in the inside plaster walls and
patch them after the insulation is installed than to drill through
stucco (and the steel mesh it is applied to). Patching holes on the
outside will never match the old stucco, and painting stucco is to
be avoided, at least if the stucco is not already painted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to paint a new radiator with a latex primer and latex
paint. Would this be acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PAGE, Allston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not in the handyman's opinion. The latex paint and primer
could develop rust spots, and latex paints may not hold their color
on a hot radiator. It is better to use an oil primer (Kilz is
good), and an oil-based finish paint. Actually, you could use an
aerosol spray enamel as a finish coat. Of course, be careful when
spraying indoors. With care and practice it is possible not to get
the spray paint all over the floor, walls, and anywhere else you
don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I discovered an old picnic table under a big pile of leaves.
The wood is still in good shape. Should I paint or stain?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES WAGNER, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Stain, by all means. With paint you have to apply a primer
first, and it just isn't worth thinking about, because the problem
will be peeling. Use a stain, a semitransparent stain of the color
of your choice. Only one coat is needed, and can be repeated
(again, one coat) in three to five years. If you put it on thinly,
and the wood is as good as you say, there will be no peeling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

A TRAGIC END TO A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ His 2,200-mile flight from wartime
atrocities in his Central American homeland carried him to this
fishing capital's pungent waterfront, where he lived quietly and
died horribly, screaming in a language few understood.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ajqui, 40, was part of a nearly invisible industrial
underground, achieving an identity in death that was inconceivable
in a life of struggle and flight and toil in a gritty blue-collar
workplace increasingly foreign to most US workers.
</P>
<P>
   He was crushed to death last week in a vat that steams and mixes
fish guts into fertilizer as his 19-year-old son, Francisco, stood
nearby _ close enough to hear his father's haunting screams in his
native Mayan tongue: ``Help me! Help me! Get me out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the most tragic thing I've ever heard of,'' said
Earl R. Chase Sr., president of the American Indian Friends
Coalition Inc. ``He came here to help protect his family. He was
doing work that most of us wouldn't do and he took it gladly. It's
dirty. It's dangerous. They're working with razor-sharp knives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when your family is starving, you do it. That's why he
jumped into that vat. He was told to clean it, and he did it with
no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   As authorities investigate, lawyers strategize, and officials of
the fish-processing plant ponder its liability, Ajqui's co-workers
and friends in a closely knit community of an estimated 2,000 Mayan
Indians here grieve a death more horrifying than they thought
possible in what they unabashedly consider a land of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so very sad,'' said Anibal, a Mayan and a friend of Ajqui,
who asked, through an interpreter that his last name not be used.
``The rest of his children are too little to work and the family is
going to be just devastated financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ajqui grew up in the Quiche region of Guatemala, part of
an estimated 80 percent of that nation's population that is
ethnically Indian, most of whom speak an indigenous language.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Ajqui's life was threatened two years ago by
members of an army engaged in a 36-year civil war that subjected
the country's Indians to massive human rights violations,
particularly in villages where they were they were suspected by the
Guatemalan military of collaborating with leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The father of four sons and two daughters concluded the only way
to protect and provide for his family was to leave them behind. He
immigrated to the United States two years ago, joined a year later
by his oldest son, Francisco. His employers knew him by his
mother's last name, Gutierrez. But he preferred his native Mayan
name, Ajqui, which carries the full flavor of a civilization that
thrived from nearly 2,000 before Christ until the Spanish conquest
in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The New Bedford that Antonio Ajqui discovered in 1996 was a
hardscrabble tableaux of tenement housing, low wages, and
transportation by bicycle. But compared with conditions at home, it
was a workingman's haven.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the waterfront of what was once the world's whaling
capital in the 18th century is a collection of red-brick plastic
factories, grimy marine terminals, and processing plants which
package and sell fish around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui was a temporary worker, sent by his bosses to firms around
the city which needed fast help at a modest price. For the last two
months, he and his son worked at Atlantic Coast Fisheries, a
yellow-and-tan corrugated steel building surrounded by a chain-link
fence topped with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at packing houses here were represented by a seafood
workers union until the late 1980s. Wages at the houses declined
after the unions were busted, and the face of a historically
evolving workforce changed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish industry is going through a transition,'' said Harvey
Mickelson, a New Bedford attorney who has represented many
waterfront firms over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more mechanized and it's based on product being
processed and value added to it,'' he said. ``It's become an
industry that distributes frozen and finished product throughout
the world. The size of the plant that this gentleman was in would
not have been in existence 20 or 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday Atlantic Coast Fisheries, located just off a
boulevard named for Herman Melville, author of ``Moby Dick,'' was
running at full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 200 people who process fish for sale in the
US and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-morning, Ajqui and a co-worker were undertaking the daily
cleaning of a 10-by-20-foot vat whose rotating bars helped mix the
fish parts. Officials said that when Ajqui yanked on a hose he was
using, it snared the machinery's on switch and started it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he pulled the hose, it pulled the switch and it
started,'' a plant supervisor told the New Bedford Standard-Times.
``It got the foot and rolled him around in it.'' The local
newspaper said workers reported that there was no sign posted
instructing employees to disable the machine's power source before
the vat is cleaned, and that supervisors did not make that
procedure clear.
</P>
<P>
   Gary W. Orlacchio, a Boston attorney representing the Ajqui
family, said death, attributed to crushing injuries to the abdomen,
did not come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got shredded from the waist down,'' Orlacchio said. ``I
can't think of a more horrible way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney's office
said Wednesday it had completed its probe without filing criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating. The plant was fined $1,200 in 1989 for 10 violations
of the safety code, four of them serious. It was fined $5,000 in
1992 for 15 violations, 13 of them serious, including a citation
for failure to adopt procedures to ensure that machinery could not
be turned on while it is being maintained. The plant has been
operated under new ownership since last March. Officials there
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to interpret this any other way than to say
it's terribly insensitive to have a working population that is not
familiar with the language exposed to hazardous conditions and not
make darn sure that at least the OSHA requirements are being met,''
said Harry R. Carreiro, an outreach specialist with the Greater New
Bedford Fishermen's Family Emergency Center. ``Whether he forgot to
do it or should have done it, you can't hold the victim
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui's son was not available for comment. Friends said he was
receiving counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are preparing a workers' compensation case that could be
settled quickly. A a civil suit could take years. Asked what
damages he might seek from a jury, Orlacchio said, ``A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajqui's body was being prepared at a funeral home for its return
to Guatemala on a flight Thursday. Atlantic Coast Fisheries,
Orlacchio said, is paying the air fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most horrible thing that can happen,'' said
Mickelson. ``You're trying to do better for your family. Your son
is with you. You're working under not the best conditions and you
end up in a situation where your family will suffer for the rest of
their lives. A tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Donations to a fund established to help the Ajqui family may be
sent to the American Indian Friends Coalition, P.O. Box 50165, New
Bedford, Mass., 02745.)

   FILM-SAFE (Undated) ``Safe Men,'' this week's low-budget
American Independent comedy by a first-time writer-director, is a
movie that goes absolutely nowhere, but the journey is brief (89
minutes) and not without its engaging characters and moments of

   FILM-EYES (Undated) A good argument could be made that Brian De
Palma's ``Snake Eyes'' is a fairly dreadful movie: arty,
over-blown, preposterous beyond preposterous, filled with groaning
coincidences and fueled by one of Nicolas Cage's most
self-indulgent performances.
</P>
<P>
   But I choose to see it as De Palma's most daring,
let-it-all-hang-out adventure in storytelling _ virtually his
late-in-life attempt at a ``Citizen Kane.'' It doesn't completely
work, but he has great fun with the medium, and it's infectious.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a delicious scene in Tommy O'Haver's first feature,
``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Sean P. Hayes) is in love with an irrationally idealized,
perfect and obsessive vision of a straight man named,
prophetically, Gabriel (Brad Rowe). The two become friends and,
after a night of drinking, Gabriel conveniently crashes at Billy's
house. Gabriel has an estranged girlfriend somewhere in San
Francisco but the two spend the night in, first, adjoining rooms
and later share the bed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telling and truthful universal moment that beautifully
captures the sleepless anxiety that occurs when the senses, the
mind _ and the body _ are fully aroused by the presense of the
exalted beloved and the consequences of chance and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a couple scenes do not a movie make. O'Haver
professes to having been tainted early on by ``women's melodramas''
_ ``The Heiress,'' ``Imitation Of Life'' and probably anything
starring Joan Crawford _ but ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss''
feels, in truth, more akin to ``Gidget'' or the ``Beach Party''
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Billy wants to be in love. He claims to be a romantic but he's
really a fussy film director and photographer whose lens keeps him
removed from real life. He's a human third eye. When he meets
Gabriel, all of that changes. He's always picked ``unavailable''
partners in the past, and Gabriel initially seems decent and open.
There's just a minor problem _ he's heterosexual. Billy at first
suffers and then again retreats behind the camera until, when fate
intervenes, he finds there is life after true confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a Pedro Almodovar-esque, dark subversiveness that
promises to add a little snap to the recent mediocre gay film
scene, the film opts to segue into the bright light and sunny
superficiality of '60s movie purity and moral caution. The second
half of the film never matches the brooding intensity of the
opening act and that proves to be its downfall. It's sanitized
beyond belief to be a comforting ``crossover'' film.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's journey doesn't equal much more than that of any scared
young guy who can't fathom commitment with anyone who might be
emotionally available. It's the same old plotline that threatens to
curse all recent Third World cinema: the protagonists just keep
lusting after the wrong people because they're trying to gain
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Paglia once wrote that counter-culture groups such as
gays (or any minority) are in danger of becoming acculturated into
society and giving up the fight in exchange for a mainstream stamp
of approval. If ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' _ as well as
other new ``Big Chill'' gay/ethnic cinematic blends such as
``Relax, It's Just Sex''_ are any indicator, then the anarchic,
sexualized out-there movies of gay cinema, like ``Swoon,'' ``The
Living End,'' ``Go Fish'' and ``The Watermelon Woman,'' may be the
next endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss. Directed and written by Tommy
O'Haver. Cast: Sean P. Hayes, Brad Rowe. Trimark Pictures. 92
minutes. Rated R for gay themes, sexual content.

`SAFE MEN' GOES NOWHERE, BUT DOES HAVE ITS MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Safe Men,'' this week's low-budget American Independent comedy
by a first-time writer-director, is a movie that goes absolutely
nowhere, but the journey is brief (89 minutes) and not without its
engaging characters and moments of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes are Sam (Sam Rockwell) and Eddie (Steve Zahn), a pair
of dim-witted, harrowingly untalented entertainers obviously
modeled after the Hope and Crosby of the ``Road'' pictures, or
perhaps Beatty and Hoffman of ``Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bar one night, the guys are mistaken for a pair of gifted
safe-crackers (hence the title), and hauled before Big Fat Bernie
Gayle (Michael Lerner), the head of the local branch of the
Providence, R.I., Jewish mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bernie intends to kill them if they don't rob a series of
safes he has lined up for them, they naturally pretend to be the
real safe men, and spend the rest of the movie trying and failing
to live up to their unearned reputations.
</P>
<P>
   After a straight-forward opening, the film gradually settles
into a farce that thinks nothing of having its protagonist suddenly
disclose he's wearing false buttocks (he feels his own are too
small), or stopping the action to have a character tell a
three-minute story about a woman destroyed by a pair of flammable
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it's been a while since a tiny movie like this one
has provided so many meaty character parts _ not only leads
Rockwell (``Lawn Dogs'') and Zahn (``Out of Sight''), but also
Lerner, Harvey Fierstein (as a rival gangster) and particularly
Paul Giamatti (as Bernie's insecure toadie).
</P>
<P>
   The considerable downside of the picture is that it doesn't
really have a script _ nothing close to a three-act structure or
the profusion of plot that even a farce needs to be credible over a
feature length. It's just a succession of acting-class exercises
that are all rather well done but unconnected to any satisfying,
larger design.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's more inspired goofiness than in most of the
cookie-cutter American Indie comedies that have whisked through the
multiplexes so far this year. If writer-director John Hamburg (who
is only a year out of film school) can ever master the basics of
screenwriting, he could be a filmmaker to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Men. Directed and written by John Hamburg. Cast: Sam
Rockwell, Steve Zahn, Mark Ruffalo, Harvey Fierstein, Michael
Lerner. October Films. Varsity. 89 minutes. Unrated.

YOU CAN VIEW `SNAKE EYES' TWO WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good argument could be made that Brian De Palma's ``Snake
Eyes'' is a fairly dreadful movie: arty, over-blown, preposterous
beyond preposterous, filled with groaning coincidences and fueled
by one of Nicolas Cage's most self-indulgent performances.
</P>
<P>
   But I choose to see it as De Palma's most daring,
let-it-all-hang-out adventure in storytelling _ virtually his
late-in-life attempt at a ``Citizen Kane.'' It doesn't completely
work, but he has great fun with the medium, and it's infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a conspiracy to assassinate a controversial
Secretary of Defense while he's watching a world heavyweight boxing
championship in an Atlantic City gambling casino. To complicate
matters, it takes place while the city is being battered by a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The main characters are a marginally crooked cop (Cage), who is
sitting ringside and has a huge bet on the fight, and his best
friend, a naval officer (Gary Sinise) who is in charge of the
secretary's security guard while he attends the event.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a mysterious lady (Carla Gugino) who confronts the
secretary moments before the shots ring out, a heavyweight champ
(Stan Shaw) who takes an obvious dive at the same time, and
assorted cops, gamblers, gangsters, journalists and conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   When the secretary is shot, pandemonium breaks out, the
entrances of the arena are blocked, and the cop and his Navy buddy
work together to try and solve the complicated crime in the hour or
so it will take the federal cops to make their way through the
storm to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   But De Palma constantly diverges from this narrative line to
examine every aspect of the story from an array of viewpoints,
often going back in time and working up to scenes we're already
witnessed from a fresh perspective. So the film is a succcesion of
``Rashomon''-like layers of truth.
</P>
<P>
   And he complements this scheme visually. Not only does he
skillfully integrate the video technology involved in the huge
sporting event into his thriller plot-line, he moves his own camera
through walls and ceilings, occasionally allows it to take the eye
of one of his characters, and zips it around the auditorium as if
it has a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenging movie, and one to which, frankly, it's not
always easy to stay connected. We often see sequences in which the
most important scene appears to be missing (to be supplied later),
or find ourselves lost in a flashback from some secondary
character's point-of-view.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if we pay attention, the puzzle all comes together
neatly. And the movie's energy, wit and directorial boldness
finally make us forget its absurd improbabilities. Even Cage, who
bounces off the walls throughout as if he's on speed, ultimately
wins us over.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Snake Eyes'' is one more in a surprising number of
big Hollywood movies this summer that are simply sick to death of
the old formulas and the old conventions and are desperate to try
something _ anything! _ new. For this alone, it deserves our
respect, and a look.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes. Directed and produced by Brian De Palma. Screenplay
by David Koepp. Cast: Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, John Heard, Carla
Gugino. Paramount. 99 minutes. Rated R for violence.

ZHIVKOV, COMMUNIST LEADER OF BULGARIA FOR 35 YEARS, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (Eds, a longer version of the obit will move as OBIT-ZHIVKOV)  
(gm) 
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todor Zhivkov, the Communist ruler of Bulgaria from 1954 until
his ouster in 1989, died Wednesday night at a hospital in the
capital, Sofia. He was 86. Doctors said he died of complications
following a respiratory infection in July.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov was a conventional party apparatchik and this, more than
anything else, may have enabled him to endure the turmoil of Balkan
politics and the periodic upheavals in the Kremlin, to which he
paid fealty throughout his long career.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, he boasted more than any other European Communist
leader about his intimate ties with the Soviet Union, saying the
two countries `breathe with the same lungs, and the same blood
flows in our veins'' and that they were as close as ``teeth to
lip.'' This served him well through the three decades in which
Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1989 as East European regimes were collapsing
one by one, he was brought down with the blessing of the
reform-minded Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in a bloodless putsch
organized by senior officials in the Sofia government.
</P>
<P>
   During Zhivkov's long tenure, he authorized a forced
assimilation drive against Bulgaria's 1 million ethnic Turks in
which more than 100 were killed and 310,000 forcibly expelled. In a
campaign that aroused international condemnation in the mid-1980s,
ethnic Turks were deprived of linguistic, cultural and religious
rights. They were dismissed from jobs and rounded up at night,
trucked to police stations, and forced to change their Islamic
Turkish names into Slavic names.
</P>
<P>
   He was responsible for the construction in 1959 of concentration
camps for political prisoners just as the Soviet Union was
dismantling Stalin's Gulags. He was also said to be behind the
murder in London in 1978 of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer in
exile who had made mocking broadcasts about Zhivkov for Radio Free
Europe. In one of the strangest assassinations of the Cold War,
Markov was killed on Waterloo Bridge by an agent who used a special
umbrella to shoot a poisoned pellet into his leg.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhivkov-era concentration camps were at Kotsian, Bogdanov
Dol, Belene Island in the Danube and Lovech. As many as 1,000
prisoners were held in Lovech from 1959 to its closing in 1962 and
at least 100 died or were killed there, according to the Interior
Ministry. Disclosures of their existence came in 1990 a few months
after Zhivkov was ousted. A Ministry of Interior spokesman said,
``Todor Zhivkov at least knew or gave the orders. The problem is
that from this period there were few material traces. It was done
on the telephone.''''
</P>
<P>
   He was never tried for political crimes; prosecutors concluded
it would be too difficult to make charges stick. Instead he was
tried on charges of illegally spending the equivalent of $24
million in state funds. In 1992, after a trial that lasted 18
months, during which he was scornful and defiant, he was convicted
and sentenced to seven years in prison. Apparently, the
post-Zhivkov government, which included many of his former
associates, was reluctant to rake over the coals of their mutual
past.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to his heart problems and age he was allowed to
serve his time under house arrest at the mountain slope home of his
granddaughter overlooking Sofia, and even to make a foray to his
birthplace in Pravets, 44 miles northeast of the capital.'' In
February 1996, Bulgaria's highest court acquitted him of the
embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, at the height of his power, he turned
Pravets into a model town, reached from Sofia by a rare four-lane
highway. The house where he was born was opened as a historical
monument. In addition, Pravets got a ``historical'' museum
chronicling his, and Communist Bulgaria's life.
</P>
<P>
   When he visited in 1995, the Zhivkov home was empty and the
museum closed. But he was given the deed to the eight acres of
farmland owned by his father and collectivized by the son in the
1950s and now returned to his private hands. A circle had been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov married Dr. Mara Maleeva, a physician, in 1938. She died
in 1971. Their daughter Lyudmila, who, under her father's tutelage
became minister of culture at age 32 in 1975 and encouraged modern
art and published works by authors like Allen Ginsberg, died under
mysterious circumstances six years later. Some suspected that her
death in a bathtub at her father's official residence was a
suicide, others that she was killed by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A son, Vladimir, and two grandchildren survive.

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

FROM BYTES TO BITE: SILICON VALLEY ELITE TACKLE MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN McKINNEY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ You can tell a lot about people by the way
the eat. In Silicon Valley, where big business is often conducted
over burritos, most executives take a simple point-and-click
approach to dining. But that's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Web heads and techno-titans are learning that, even in an
entrepreneurial environment, where casual is king, it sometimes
takes more than a million-dollar idea to woo capital and clients.
</P>
<P>
   It takes good manners.
</P>
<P>
   So for the past three years, Sue Fox and Lyndy Janes have made
manners their business. Since the two Los Gatos residents opened
The Workshoppe, they've been teaching the etiquette illiterate of
the high-tech literati the proper way to eat Cornish hen, or how to
correct wardrobe and grooming.
</P>
<P>
   With a list of clients that include Apple, Hewlett Packard and
Web TV, the two have their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man thought that licking your knife was the acceptable way
to clean it,'' laughs Workshoppe co-founder Fox. ``It may be a
dog-eat-dog world out there in high tech, but that doesn't mean you
should behave like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Janes and Fox began their protocol training workshops for teens,
but soon moved on to teaching their parents as well. According to
Janes, who is British, many Silicon Valley executives feel a little
insecure and even embarrassed when it comes to entertaining and
fine dining. A certain ``je ne sais quoi'' has been lost amid the
hustle and bustle of high tech-life styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason for mum saying `Get your elbows off the
table,' and it's coming into play now in business and socially.''
says Janes, in her crisp British cadence. ``With people from Europe
and other areas coming to do business here, we all should be more
aware of our own culture,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   True, first impressions do count. But in a valley where
executives proclaim their status at the office by wearing shorts
and sandals, and computer code often takes precedence over dress
code, isn't emphasizing proper manners a little too Victorian?
</P>
<P>
   Not a bit of it, Janes argues. The Workshoppe stresses function
over formality _ taking the prissiness out of etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making other people feel comfortable around you and
being considerate towards them. We don't expect clients to leave
here behaving like a character in a Merchant Ivory movie,'' Janes
says. ``Although that would be very romantic,'' she adds with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   And Janes is all-too-often reminded of the scope of her work as
a manners missionary. Walking through the San Jose Fairmont's
fanciest eatery on the way to teach a class on table etiquette, she
passes a man with something stuck in his teeth, something enormous
that he's attempting to gouge out with his finger. The well attired
young woman seated across from him doesn't seem to mind, but Janes
knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look very nice. I wouldn't want that man to pass me
the bread basket, would you?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workshoppe participants have stories of their own. Kathleen
O'Roarke, of San Jose, went to the class after attending a state
dinner at the White House. It was a formative experience for the
new etiquette connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in between these two guys, and the one on the
right really knew what he was doing, made it look easy; but the one
on the left was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out later that the man to her left, made so vulnerable
by forks and fingerbowls, was a former secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the cultivated, manners still make the man. O'Roarke
remembers a brother-in-law with an doctorate who chewed loud enough
to deafen table conversation. Janes has noticed similar tendencies
among Silicon Valley elite. ``Some CEOs don't care so much about
manners, but even the most powerful man could be dreadful to sit
next to at dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Among tales of terrible teeth pickers and embarrassing gristle
gaffes Janes reminds her class that even the most well-intended
diner may not be well-informed. In one case, a woman took her
fiancee in for a private consultation because she was concerned
about his table manners. The man was a corporate executive and the
couple enjoyed all the trappings of a sophisticated lifestyle; but
one thing was horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted on licking his knife before putting it back on the
table.'' recalls Janes, who had to delve into the client's past to
get to the root of the problem. It turned out that the impulse was
well-intended: save a clean table cloth from being soiled. While he
was barely tall enough to reach the table, the man had used the
technique to impress his mother. As his fiancee feared, it wasn't
going over as well at corporate luncheons. And perhaps worst of
all, it was threatening their marriage plans: his future
mother-in-law couldn't stomach his table behavior.

   CALIF-MISSING-GIRL (Seaside, Calif.) _ Two months ago,
13-year-old Christina Marie Williams took her dog, Greg, for a walk

reported seeing two men in an old sedan lurking in the area before
and after Christina and the dog went walking. One woman told the
authorities she saw a girl who matched Christina's description
sitting in the car, looking frightened. Those sightings, unusual
for a kidnapping case, enabled the federal authorities to develop
sketches of the men and the car they were driving. But in the seven

have to go on. That, and fervent prayers that Northern California
does not have another Polly Klaas case on its hands. By Michael

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Travel light, but be prepared
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been traveling the world and writing about its people and
politics for almost nine years. My latest assignment was the
Baltics. A series of stories over the next couple of weeks will be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But with all my travels _ everywhere from South Africa to
Siberia to Baghdad _ you'd think I would've garnered much wisdom of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are just two things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   1. That the world is divided into two distinct cultures:
Countries where buses pass on hills and curves and countries where
buses do not pass on hills and curves.
</P>
<P>
   2. How to pack.
</P>
<P>
   If you're taking a trip, take it from me _ there are but three
necessities for the traveler:
</P>
<P>
   Passport, tickets, money. Everything else is dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   On my latest trip, involving stops in six countries in 16 days,
I managed with one suitcase (a folding bag with rollers and lots of
pockets) plus a carry-on. The carry-on is for passport, tickets and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I can't believe the stuff I feel I can't leave home
without. Here's an inventory I took along the way:
</P>
<P>
   _ Penlight, duct tape, multi-purpose knife/tool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rain-resistant cap, collapsible umbrella, Scotch tape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Office stationery for faxes, business cards, press card.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walking shoes, dress shoes, one pair each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three pairs of pants, six shirts, six to eight changes of
underwear and socks. (I usually take old clothes and often discard
them toward the end of the trip. I'm probably the only man who ever
left Hong Kong with one less suit than he arrived with.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Miniature clock that covers the world's time zones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adhesive tape, Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue blazer, weatherproof zipper jacket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photocopy of passport.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bath sponge, bath brush. (Washcloths are a novelty in much of
the rest of the world.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Paperback novels. (English-language reading material is often
scarce and always expensive.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra pair of eyeglasses, extra batteries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shower shoes, sweat suit. (Comfortable attire on overnight
trains.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleep mask, earplugs. (Necessities on overnight trains.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Wet Ones. (Next best thing to a shower on overnight trains.)
</P>
<P>
   _ One necktie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Antibacterial ointment, stomach medicine, allergy pills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recyclable cameras preloaded with film.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pocket notebooks, ballpoint pens, micro-tape recorder and
extra tapes.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it _ most everything that I required for France,
Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, making my way by
trains, planes and automobiles, starting out in Paris and ending up
in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that they tell this joke about the train that runs
between Paris and Moscow:
</P>
<P>
   When travelers from Paris arrive in Warsaw, they look out the
windows and say, ``Oh, we're already in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   When travelers from Moscow arrive in Warsaw, they look out the
windows and say, ``Oh, we're already in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Warsaw likes to think of itself as the Paris of
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Paris, and I saw Warsaw. Warsaw, at best, is the Paris of
Eastern Poland.
</P>
<P>
   More later.

JUVENILE CROCODILE GETS A HOME ... FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A 3-foot crocodile that was found in the back
yard of a San Francisco home will be turned over the a Golden Gate
Park aquarium rather than put to death, animal control officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Steinhart Aquarium will provide a temporary home for Ernest
the crocodile, which was netted July 28 by an animal control
officer at a Mission District house. The resident had reported that
a ``large lizard'' was threatening her cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Steinhart came through, we realized that it was
better,'' said Animal Care and Control spokeswoman Melissa Flowers.
``We keep him in our own city, and he doesn't have to go through
shipping'' to a facility in Boulder, Colo., that also agreed to
take the reptile.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty juvenile croc had been living in temporary shelter
where it was fed frozen hamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the capture, animal care and control officials had tried
hard to find him a home. Request after request was turned down,
including a rejection from Steinhart, and officials said they had
no choice but to kill the reptile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bushwater Reptiles of Boulder, a company that specializes
in reptile transfers, offered to assume the burden of looking for a
home for Ernest.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the offer, shelter officials began making
arrangements to send Ernest to Boulder, but they learned that the
reptile could not be flown because of an airline embargo on
shipping animals during the summer as protection against the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were looking into other travel options for Ernest,
Flowers said, when an official from Steinhart said Wednesday
morning that the aquarium would take over the responsibility of
finding a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do the most appropriate thing for the animal,
and that's to find it a good home,'' said Ken Howell, senior
aquatic biologist at the aquarium.

self-indulgent performances.
</P>

   But I choose to see it as De Palma's most daring,
let-it-all-hang-out adventure in storytelling _ virtually his
late-in-life attempt at a ``Citizen Kane.'' It doesn't completely

`BILLY'S KISS' WORTH IT SOME OF THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a delicious scene in Tommy O'Haver's first feature,
``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Sean P. Hayes) is in love with an irrationally idealized,
perfect and obsessive vision of a straight man named,
prophetically, Gabriel (Brad Rowe). The two become friends and,
after a night of drinking, Gabriel conveniently crashes at Billy's
house. Gabriel has an estranged girlfriend somewhere in San
Francisco but the two spend the night in, first, adjoining rooms
and later share the bed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telling and truthful universal moment that beautifully
captures the sleepless anxiety that occurs when the senses, the
mind _ and the body _ are fully aroused by the presense of the
exalted beloved and the consequences of chance and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a couple scenes do not a movie make. O'Haver
professes to having been tainted early on by ``women's melodramas''
_ ``The Heiress,'' ``Imitation Of Life'' and probably anything
starring Joan Crawford _ but ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss''
feels, in truth, more akin to ``Gidget'' or the ``Beach Party''
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Billy wants to be in love. He claims to be a romantic but he's
really a fussy film director and photographer whose lens keeps him
removed from real life. He's a human third eye. When he meets
Gabriel, all of that changes. He's always picked ``unavailable''
partners in the past, and Gabriel initially seems decent and open.
There's just a minor problem _ he's heterosexual. Billy at first
suffers and then again retreats behind the camera until, when fate
intervenes, he finds there is life after true confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a Pedro Almodovar-esque, dark subversiveness that
promises to add a little snap to the recent mediocre gay film
scene, the film opts to segue into the bright light and sunny
superficiality of '60s movie purity and moral caution. The second
half of the film never matches the brooding intensity of the
opening act and that proves to be its downfall. It's sanitized
beyond belief to be a comforting ``crossover'' film.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's journey doesn't equal much more than that of any scared
young guy who can't fathom commitment with anyone who might be
emotionally available. It's the same old plotline that threatens to
curse all recent Third World cinema: the protagonists just keep
lusting after the wrong people because they're trying to gain
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Paglia once wrote that counter-culture groups such as
gays (or any minority) are in danger of becoming acculturated into
society and giving up the fight in exchange for a mainstream stamp
of approval. If ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' _ as well as
other new ``Big Chill'' gay/ethnic cinematic blends such as
``Relax, It's Just Sex''_ are any indicator, then the anarchic,
sexualized out-there movies of gay cinema, like ``Swoon,'' ``The
Living End,'' ``Go Fish'' and ``The Watermelon Woman,'' may be the
next endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss. Directed and written by Tommy
O'Haver. Cast: Sean P. Hayes, Brad Rowe. Trimark Pictures. 92
minutes. Rated R for gay themes, sexual content.

`SAFE MEN' GOES NOWHERE, BUT DOES HAVE ITS MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Safe Men,'' this week's low-budget American Independent comedy
by a first-time writer-director, is a movie that goes absolutely
nowhere, but the journey is brief (89 minutes) and not without its
engaging characters and moments of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes are Sam (Sam Rockwell) and Eddie (Steve Zahn), a pair
of dim-witted, harrowingly untalented entertainers obviously
modeled after the Hope and Crosby of the ``Road'' pictures, or
perhaps Beatty and Hoffman of ``Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bar one night, the guys are mistaken for a pair of gifted
safe-crackers (hence the title), and hauled before Big Fat Bernie
Gayle (Michael Lerner), the head of the local branch of the
Providence, R.I., Jewish mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bernie intends to kill them if they don't rob a series of
safes he has lined up for them, they naturally pretend to be the
real safe men, and spend the rest of the movie trying and failing
to live up to their unearned reputations.
</P>
<P>
   After a straight-forward opening, the film gradually settles
into a farce that thinks nothing of having its protagonist suddenly
disclose he's wearing false buttocks (he feels his own are too
small), or stopping the action to have a character tell a
three-minute story about a woman destroyed by a pair of flammable
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it's been a while since a tiny movie like this one
has provided so many meaty character parts _ not only leads
Rockwell (``Lawn Dogs'') and Zahn (``Out of Sight''), but also
Lerner, Harvey Fierstein (as a rival gangster) and particularly
Paul Giamatti (as Bernie's insecure toadie).
</P>
<P>
   The considerable downside of the picture is that it doesn't
really have a script _ nothing close to a three-act structure or
the profusion of plot that even a farce needs to be credible over a
feature length. It's just a succession of acting-class exercises
that are all rather well done but unconnected to any satisfying,
larger design.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's more inspired goofiness than in most of the
cookie-cutter American Indie comedies that have whisked through the
multiplexes so far this year. If writer-director John Hamburg (who
is only a year out of film school) can ever master the basics of
screenwriting, he could be a filmmaker to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Men. Directed and written by John Hamburg. Cast: Sam
Rockwell, Steve Zahn, Mark Ruffalo, Harvey Fierstein, Michael
Lerner. October Films. Varsity. 89 minutes. Unrated.

YOU CAN VIEW `SNAKE EYES' TWO WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good argument could be made that Brian De Palma's ``Snake
Eyes'' is a fairly dreadful movie: arty, over-blown, preposterous
beyond preposterous, filled with groaning coincidences and fueled
by one of Nicolas Cage's most self-indulgent performances.
</P>
<P>
   But I choose to see it as De Palma's most daring,
let-it-all-hang-out adventure in storytelling _ virtually his
late-in-life attempt at a ``Citizen Kane.'' It doesn't completely
work, but he has great fun with the medium, and it's infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a conspiracy to assassinate a controversial
Secretary of Defense while he's watching a world heavyweight boxing
championship in an Atlantic City gambling casino. To complicate
matters, it takes place while the city is being battered by a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The main characters are a marginally crooked cop (Cage), who is
sitting ringside and has a huge bet on the fight, and his best
friend, a naval officer (Gary Sinise) who is in charge of the
secretary's security guard while he attends the event.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a mysterious lady (Carla Gugino) who confronts the
secretary moments before the shots ring out, a heavyweight champ
(Stan Shaw) who takes an obvious dive at the same time, and
assorted cops, gamblers, gangsters, journalists and conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   When the secretary is shot, pandemonium breaks out, the
entrances of the arena are blocked, and the cop and his Navy buddy
work together to try and solve the complicated crime in the hour or
so it will take the federal cops to make their way through the
storm to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   But De Palma constantly diverges from this narrative line to
examine every aspect of the story from an array of viewpoints,
often going back in time and working up to scenes we're already
witnessed from a fresh perspective. So the film is a succcesion of
``Rashomon''-like layers of truth.
</P>
<P>
   And he complements this scheme visually. Not only does he
skillfully integrate the video technology involved in the huge
sporting event into his thriller plot-line, he moves his own camera
through walls and ceilings, occasionally allows it to take the eye
of one of his characters, and zips it around the auditorium as if
it has a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenging movie, and one to which, frankly, it's not
always easy to stay connected. We often see sequences in which the
most important scene appears to be missing (to be supplied later),
or find ourselves lost in a flashback from some secondary
character's point-of-view.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if we pay attention, the puzzle all comes together
neatly. And the movie's energy, wit and directorial boldness
finally make us forget its absurd improbabilities. Even Cage, who
bounces off the walls throughout as if he's on speed, ultimately
wins us over.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Snake Eyes'' is one more in a surprising number of
big Hollywood movies this summer that are simply sick to death of
the old formulas and the old conventions and are desperate to try
something _ anything! _ new. For this alone, it deserves our
respect, and a look.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes. Directed and produced by Brian De Palma. Screenplay
by David Koepp. Cast: Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, John Heard, Carla
Gugino. Paramount. 99 minutes. Rated R for violence.

   CALIF-MISSING-GIRL (Seaside, Calif.) _ Two months ago,
13-year-old Christina Marie Williams took her dog, Greg, for a walk
in her neighborhood on the evening of June 12. About a half-hour
later, Greg wandered back alone. Over the next few days, witnesses
reported seeing two men in an old sedan lurking in the area before
and after Christina and the dog went walking. One woman told the
authorities she saw a girl who matched Christina's description
sitting in the car, looking frightened. Those sightings, unusual
for a kidnapping case, enabled the federal authorities to develop

COLLEAGUES RECALL STUDENT SLAIN IN NATION'S CAPITAL

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a loud and hearty laugh, Christine Mirzayan
stood out from her scientist peers during her seven years of study
at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that laugh was silenced with the killing of the newlywed
over the weekend while she was on a summer internship in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to conjure her up without thinking of her laugh,''
said Cori Bargmann, a professor in the Department of Anatomy at the
San Francisco university. ``She was so happy and cheerful. Among
scientists, that's not always the case and so that was particularly
notable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bargmann said students and professors in the university's
science department were devastated by the death.
</P>
<P>
   Mirzayan, 28, spent seven years at the university, earning her
doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biology. While studying at
the school, she met and married fellow student David Hackos, 30,
also a doctoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Mirzayan graduated in January and moved to Washington in June
for an internship at the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she attended a barbecue party thrown by a fellow
intern in the program. Rather than go out dancing with some of
those who attended the party, she decided to walk back to her dorm
room on the campus of Georgetown University late in the evening,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   While walking home alone, Mirzayan was attacked just outside of
university property. Her body was found Sunday by passersby and the
police said the apparent cause of death was blunt force injuries to
the head, although autopsy results are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is offering a $10,000 reward
for information leading to an arrest in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew her as a delightful, energetic student in my laboratory
at,'' said Bruce Alberts, a former instructor of the woman and
president of the National Academy of Sciences. ``Brilliant,
articulate, and with tremendous spark, Christine had all the
attributes of a future leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberts said that Mirzayan had received her undergraduate degree
at Yale University and was about to start a fellowship on Capitol
Hill upon completion of her internship. Her husband planned to move
to Washington to join her after completing his degree.

   WASHINGTON _ Consider some of the ways the Internet improves our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one: The other day, my son Sam walked into a library
building at the University of Heidelberg, sat down at a German
computer keyboard, accessed a Yale University e-mail account back
in Connecticut, and exchanged dozens of messages with his college
friends, who have scattered for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although students are able to romp in cyberspace for free from
Heidelberg, the librarians there insist that every visitor check
his or her gear at the door and pay what amounts to a $4 deposit to
make sure it's picked up on departure. It's a question of security.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: A pair of huge, once-valued stereo amplifiers
have sat in my attic for years. Recently, within hours of posting
those goods on a World Wide Web hi-fi flea market site, I found a
buyer in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the express company collects the cash on delivering the
package, selling the vintage amps to an utter stranger posed little
risk to me. But what if that shipment held bricks instead of the
advertised goods? Again, it's a matter of trust.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Internet can offer users more convenient and
flexible ways of exchanging data or buying and selling goods than
traditional forms of trade or communication. But broadly felt
distrust hampers electronic commerce from reaching its full
potential.
</P>
<P>
   As matters stand, it's a snap to upload a ``contract'' saying,
for instance, that you've agreed to give me free phone service for
the next six months. So, absent the safety provided by what
insiders call trusted systems, it's understandable that not many of
us feel comfortable using e-mail to issue invoices, pay bills or
write binding contracts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, each time a bug is found in Internet software, the
confidence needed to create a true mass market is shaken anew.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last month when researchers at Finland's Oulu
University came across some fresh digital mischief. It permits
e-mail that arrives along with an attached file _ in some
situations _ to stall a computer, kill data, or unleash a virus.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Microsoft nor Netscape had received customer
complaints about the vulnerability of their e-mail ``clients,''
both firms promptly moved to patch their exposed software. As is
usually the case, the supposed dangers, but not the subsequent
fixes, made news.
</P>
<P>
   Foolproof Internet security requires users to implement such
related concepts as access control, audit trails, authenticated
identities, guaranteed privacy, and validity checks that ensure
data hasn't been corrupted during either transmission or storage.
Experts also see a need to bar people from disavowing transactions
_ so the assertion that ``I never placed that order'' flies only if
it's accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some good news: All these needs are now being tested in
major computer labs. Some of them can already be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, bad vibes continue to float through cyberspace.
And, unless human character changes in our digital future, for many
people, these concerns are likely to persist.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, I attended an Orioles baseball game at Camden Yards in
Baltimore. I grew up in Baltimore in the 'sixties during the team's
glory days. Back then, my family attended hundreds of games.
 &HT;    After we moved west in 1972, I became convinced that the team's
decline was directly tied to our departure.
 &HT;    Baseball is my mother's religion. As long as I can remember,
summer meant baseball. She taught us everything about the game. She
embodied its passion.
 &HT;    Arriving at old Memorial Stadium, Mom acted as if she were
making a pilgrimage. We always sat on the third-base line and
followed her lead. Mom's baseball liturgy was simple:
 &HT;    --Don't applaud after the national anthem. It is irreverent to
applaud a hymn.
 &HT;    --Don't leave your seat for any reason until the seventh-inning
stretch.
 &HT;    --Cheer. But be polite unless the umpire is really stupid.
 &HT;    --Don't leave the game until the last pitch is thrown.
 &HT;    --Believe the Orioles will win and they will (if they don't,
your faith was inadequate).
 &HT;    At Camden Yards with my family, I sensed my mother's presence.
Throughout the game, I kept instructing my stepson on Mom's Rules.
He'd only been to one major league game. His behavior shocked me;
he seemed to be a baseball pagan. The boy needed training.
 &HT;    I, however, felt inadequate to the task. I needed Mom. Breaking
a rule, I phoned her and held up the receiver so she could hear
that baseball park sound. She cried.
 &HT;    Baseball is my mother's faith. It is not mine. I enjoy and
understand it. I know how to watch a game. Occasionally, a great
game gives me chills. But I don't worship it. In the end, as it did
for my stepson on that hot Baltimore Saturday, baseball eludes me.
 &HT;    Poor Mom. Passing one's faith to children is difficult. And
inheriting one's parents' faith can seem like a curse. I never
fully embraced mother's baseball religion, no matter how thoroughly
she indoctrinated me.
 &HT;    Sitting in Camden Yards, I imitated her ritual but lacked her
passion. I felt guilty all the while.
 &HT;    In her recent book, ``Amazing Grace,'' Kathleen Norris writes of
family faith: ``Human inheritance is both blessing and curse. And
in religious inheritance this paradox is acute. For many of us
religion is heavy baggage.''
 &HT;    That baggage takes many forms. For some, the difficulty is
summoning the faith of a devout forebear. Some depart from
long-standing family tradition and choose another way. Some reject
faith altogether. Some embrace faith contrary to familial
skepticism. Some pick a narrower path; some, a broader one.
 &HT;    Whatever the case, it is a rare family that maintains a faith
tradition over generations. More often, families are patchworks of
faith -- a number of stories and traditions stitched into one.
 &HT;    Embracing my mother's faith has not been easy. As a college
student, I thought myself above baseball's proletarian pleasures.
``Lower class,'' ``uneducated,'' I sniffed. Eventually I passed
through that stage, but still found the game dull -- bored by my
mother's incessant summertime monologue.
 &HT;    Finally, baseball summoned to mind the narrow-mindedness and
violence of my working-class Baltimore childhood. I just couldn't
believe the way she did. Too many bad memories.
 &HT;    At Camden Yards, however, I realized that I needn't embrace my
mother's faith. I needed to accept it as hers, appreciate the
beauty of what she found, and pass the ritual onto a new
generation. I could both honor her and could be honest regarding my
own beliefs.
 &HT;    Yes, baseball is a boring sort of game. But it is my mother's
boring game. It was her way to salvation. I don't understand it,
but it is important to her.
 &HT;    Norris says all religious inheritance -- good and bad -- can
neither be forgotten nor undone. The baggage is always with us.
 &HT;    Our task is to live with it, to embrace the good and redeem the
bad. And then to pass on to our children an open-minded and
listening faith -- one described by the Episcopal prayerbook as
``an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to
persevere, a spirit to know to love you, and the gift of joy and
wonder in all your works.''
 &HT;    If my children embrace that, I won't even care if they worship
football.

SNAKE-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ A new Brian De Palma movie is always a
cause for celebration and dread. Cineastes and suspense lovers
alike know they can look forward to shocking plot twists and
virtuoso visual techniques. His new thriller, ``Snake Eyes,''finds
De Palma trying to satisfy both audience segments. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
KONG-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Fay Wray and King Kong share the marquee
again at the ``Battle of Apes'' double feature, a presentation of
the Academy Standards. Plus, some Wray trivia about the 1920s
starlet whose dramatic acting career is overshadowed by the giant
gorilla. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
LAST-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``First Love, Last Rites'' strives to
be a realistic depiction of teen-age love's consuming passions and
devouring fears, but comes off as slight and unnecessarily
symbolic. 2 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
SAFE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ There are a couple of dim bulbs at the
center of the engagingly offbeat comedy ``Safe Men,'' but unlike
the recent dimwit duos of ``BASEketball'' or ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,''
these guys mind their manners. Credit goes to first-time
writer-director John Hamburg for this charming, warm and, yes,
funny movie debut. 3 Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SNAKE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Just a few minutes into ``Snake
Eyes,'' you know you're watching a Brian De Palma movie as the
camera seamlessly follows Nicolas Cage through an Atlantic City
arena, twisting through corridors, climbing stairs, hopping onto an
escalator and finally landing on the floor of the arena in the
middle of a heavyweight prize fight. 2{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SOREL-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Eccentricity, in Louise Sorel's book,
is a good thing because it shows you're ``taking life in.'' That's
exactly what Sorel, a past winner of Soap Opera Digest's Best
Villainess Award, appears to be doing with a vengeance these days.
By Reed Johnson. 
. 
RAMBLERS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Some of California's top
country-rock musicians have turned their attentions to another
American musical form and now perform as the Laurel Canyon
Ramblers, focusing on the bluegrass music pioneered by Kentucky
multi-instrumentalist Bill Monroe in the '40s. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ Local blues-funk guitarist Stevie Gurr has
a few points in his favor right off the bat. For starters, he spent
much of the '80s recording and touring with bluesman Elvin Bishop.
Then the guitarist joined Dr. John's. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Jermaine Dupri's ``Life in 1472''
could've been the hip-hop record of the year. Musically, it just
might be. Lyrically, it makes you want to reach for the earplugs.
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
ALTMAN-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ Watching a Robert Altman movie can be
a frustrating experience for moviegoers. His latest film, ``The
Gingerbread Man,'' recently hit video stores, and the so-called
legal thriller based on a John Grisham script amply demonstrates
Altman's faults and virtues. By Rob Lowman.

JERMAINE DUPRI/``Life in 1472'' (So So Def/Columbia)
<TEXT>
<P>
   This could've been the hip-hop record of the year. Musically, it
just might be. Lyrically, it makes you want to reach for the
earplugs. Despite his early years producing teenybop sensation Kris
Kross, Dupri has grown into one very nasty piece of business. On
his first solo album _ which includes cameos from such solid
citizens as Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Master P, Mase, DMX, Nas and Too
Short _ the misogyny is truly stunning. Thing is, the music on such
cuts as ``Fresh'' and ``Money Ain't a Thang'' is so good you wish
the producer had, at the very least, a mild sense of humor. He
doesn't. Every track is filled with the b-word, n-word, m-word,
h-word and f-word. There are even interludes featuring
phone-machine messages from women making pathetic calls to Dupri,
who just snickers. If this is how the sexes relate in '98, we're
all in a lot of trouble. 1{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PATTY GRIFFIN/``Flaming Red'' (A&AMP;M)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her 1996 debut album, which was a collection of
minimalist demos, countryish rock singer Griffin's latest is full
of big guitars, drums, keyboards, percussion, strings and her
marvelous voice. Produced by Jay Joyce, the album features drummer
Kenny Aronoff, who's now touring with the Smashing Pumpkins, and
the steady support gives Griffin the perfect backdrop to put across
this strong set of originals. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIZ PHAIR/``whitechocolatespaceegg'' (Matador/Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   For her first album in four years, Phair returns with one of the
most assured and enjoyable rock efforts of '98. Produced in equal
parts by Liz herself, Scott Litt (R.E.M.) and longtime Phair
collaborator Brad Wood, the disc takes off from the homespun
intimacy of her previous two albums. The sound is fleshed out with
liberal use of keyboards and organ, ranging from the sultry title
track to the perfect pop of ``Polyester Bride.'' The often poignant
lyrics reflect Phair's new life as wife and mother, with all its
ups and downs intact, but it's clear she still knows how to rock.
3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GREGORY ISAACS/``Romantic and Righteous Sounds From the Cool
Ruler'' (Music Club)
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Cool Ruler, reggae singer Isaacs has been crooning
since the '70s. Here, he's captured at the dawn of his legacy, when
he recorded for Jamaica's beloved Trojan label. Included in this
excellent budget-priced set are two of Isaacs' all-time classics,
``Lonely Lover'' and ``All I Have Is Love,'' plus other memorable
cuts from reggae's golden age. This 16-track album also features
several extended dub versions, including ``My Time'' and ``Never Be
Ungrateful.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CATATONIA/``International Velvet'' (Vapor/Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   This five-member group from Cardiff, Wales, plays melancholy pop
with delightful hooks. On the band's sophomore effort, the mood is
upbeat, especially on such standout cuts as ``Road Rage,'' the
title track and ``Mulder and Scully,'' obviously inspired by a
certain TV show that seems to be popular worldwide. Lead singer
Cerys Matthews frequently recalls Bjork's work with the Sugarcubes.
3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DIXIE CHICKS/``Wide Open Spaces'' (Monument)
</P>
<P>
   The freshman release from Sony's revived Monument label features
polished three-part harmony that draws on all the right influences
for a pop-country smash. The Dallas-bred Chicks cover a lot of
ground here, from lush tunes like album-opener ``I Can Love You
Better'' to a twangy cover of Tom Jans' ``Loving Arms'' and the
solid blues of Bonnie Raitt's ``Give It Up or Let Me Go.'' Along
the way, these expert country crooners offer the soaring ballad
``Once You've Loved Somebody'' and a rocking ``Let 'er Rip,''
backed by some of Music Row's finest. No wonder the album is
zooming up the charts. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SQUIRREL NUT ZIPPERS/``Perennial Favorites'' (Mammoth)
</P>
<P>
   The Squirrel Nut Zippers never meant to be popular _ it was just
a happy accident. They were churning out loopy, swinging dance
music well before Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and the Cherry Poppin'
Daddies came along, and they'll still be playing it when the craze
inevitably fades. This, their third album, is full of loose, jazzy
charm, and its dozen tight songs build nicely upon each other until
the appropriate closer, ``It's Over.'' Singer-guitarists Jim Mathus
and Tom Maxwell sing with confidence and enthusiasm on the rousing,
Dixieland cut-ups ``Suits Are Picking Up the Bill'' and ``Ghost of
Stephen Foster,'' while Katherine Whalen continues to channel
Billie Holiday on ``Low Down Man'' and ``My Drag.'' It's a fun,
high-spirited album, a work destined to live up to its title. 3

WHERE THE BLUEGRASS GROWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; For those afraid the sound of authentic,
traditional California country music might be disappearing, there's
the Laurel Canyon Ramblers.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed four years ago from the ashes of the Desert
Rose Band, which had been founded by Chris Hillman, a former member
of the Byrds and Flying Burrito Brothers. Ex-Desert Rose members
Bill Bryson (bass) and Herb Pedersen (guitar and harmony vocals)
later launched the Laurel Canyon Ramblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're songwriters, musicians and singers,'' said Kenny
Blackwell, who plays mandolin in the Ramblers. ``Some of our stuff
will sound very traditional, but some stuff will show our folk,
rock and jazz influences.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell, who grew up in southern Michigan and studied mandolin
with Jethro Burns of the famous hillbilly bluegrass duo Homer &AMP;
Jethro, said the ability to improvise is extremely important for
bluegrass musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both jazz and bluegrass are very improvisational genres,'' he
said. ``Stylistically, the styles are very different but that
element is consistent in both forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime bluegrass fan and guitarist Dave Provost has caught the
Ramblers three times and said each was a very different experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on their mood,'' Provost said. ``Sometimes
they'll lean toward gospel, or they'll play fast and furious _ even
faster than punk rock but with much more precision. Their music
doesn't seem dated, but you get the sense of a tradition that goes
deeper than the Smithsonian Institute. It's not that they're
emulating a style, it's what they've grown up doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramblers, who mix the traditional Kentucky bluegrass sound
with the Southern California country-rock sound of Gram Parsons,
have released three albums, including the current disc, ``Back on
the Street Again'' (Sugar Hill).
</P>
<P>
   The band _ which also includes Roger Reed (guitar) and Gabe
Witcher (fiddle) _ appears Saturday at the John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre on a bill with traditional bluegrass outfit Lost
Highway and young bluegrass group Nickel Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramblers will also appear at McCabe's in Santa Monica in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluegrass seems to be getting more exposure than ever these
days,'' said Blackwell, who lives in Granada Hills and has repaired
guitars at the Blue Ridge Pickin' Parlor in Canoga Park for the
past 10 years. ``And that's good for everybody _ all the bands that
are really good and all the bands that are just starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluegrass originally grew out of the traditional string band
music that formed the roots of country music. Led by Kentucky
multi-instrumentalist Bill Monroe in the '40s, the original
bluegrass movement adhered to the songs, structures and conventions
of string bands but made the music faster, harder and more
technically demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The result was bluegrass; the genre named after Monroe's backing
band the Blue Grass Boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musical form is very simple, and that gives you the
freedom to express your own personality in the playing,'' says
Blackwell. ``You can put your own stamp on the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with bloodlines that include such legendary country-rock
outfits as the Byrds and the Burrito Brothers, the Laurel Canyon
Ramblers encompass such current pop artists as Beck. Witcher, the
band's new fiddle player, has played not only with Beck but Willie
Nelson, too.
</P>
<P>
   Witcher replaced Byron Berline, formerly a Parsons and Emmylou
Harris sideman and a member of the Ramblers for the band's first
three months before moving to Oklahoma where he runs his own fiddle
shop and performs locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluegrass has a lot of tradition for everyone that plays it,''
Blackwell said. ``The instrumentation doesn't change, but the
songwriting does. These days, there are more folk and country
influences in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the Ramblers perform mostly originals, including
such well-known tunes as Pedersen's ``Wait a Minute'' and ``Old
Train,'' songs that have been covered by, respectively, innovative
bluegrass guitarist Tony Rice and the great ``newgrass'' band the
Seldom Scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluegrass isn't the kind of music where you turn on the radio
and it's there,'' Blackwell explained. ``You have to search it out.
It requires some effort to uncover it. First of all, the level of
musicianship is so high. The hardest kind of guitar playing is
bluegrass flatpicking. It requires a high degree of skill,
dexterity and musicianship.''

MONKEY BUSINESS AS USUAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sight of Fay Wray being carried like a doll by
King Kong is one of those screen moments that doesn't go away,
regardless of whether you saw ``King Kong'' in the 1930s in the
movie house or in the age of television.
</P>
<P>
   That performance guaranteed her status as a cinematic cult
figure and, later, as movie trivia. But it bears mentioning that
she was a bona fide starlet before Kong ever wrapped his big,
sweaty mitts around her.
</P>
<P>
   Wray and her gargantuan co-star again share the marquee as the
Academy Standards series presents ``Battle of the Apes'' on Aug.
14, a double screening of the original ``King Kong'' and ``Mighty
Joe Young.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1933 ``Kong'' stands as the all-time king of big-ape flicks,
and not even the technical wizardry of the 1976 remake with Jeff
Bridges and Jessica Lange could knock this one off its perch. In
fact, the original ``Kong'' was just one of 11 films in which Wray
appeared in 1933. Some of her other films included the campy ``The
Vampire Bat,'' ``The Mystery of the Wax Museum'' and ``The Big
Brain''; and the more serious ``Ann Carver's Profession,'' ``One
Sunday Afternoon'' and ``The Woman I Stole.''
</P>
<P>
   Wray was raised in Los Angeles and got into the movie business
as a teen-ager by hounding casting offices for small roles. Her
breakthrough came playing the female lead in the 1928 film ``The
Wedding March,'' and she went on to co-star opposite leading men
such as Gary Cooper, Ronald Colman and Fredric March.
</P>
<P>
   After ``King Kong,'' Wray became the darling of low-budget
action pictures, and later quite effectively employed that
frightening scream from ``Kong'' in some horror features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' revised the ``King Kong'' classic image,
with special effects that took home an Oscar in 1949. It's been
almost 50 years since this big guy stomped across theater screens,
which probably would explain why a remake is in the works at
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $5 for general admission, $3 for academy members.
First screening is at 7:30 p.m. in the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences' Goldwyn Theatre, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly
Hills. Tickets may be purchased at the academy from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Tuesday through Friday, noon to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, by
mail or at the door.

   `TERMINATOR' TRIBUTE: Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Mr. Universe
who turned his chiseled physique into box-office brawn, is bigger
than a movie star. This Last Action Hero, Kennedy in-law, cigar
aficionado and all-around nice guy is a genuine XXL cultural icon.
As proof, we offer three simple words:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Need we say more?
</P>
<P>
   American Cinematheque will honor Schwarzenegger for his career
and his overall contribution to film and video on Sept. 12 at the
Moving Picture Ball at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The annual event
is the Cinematheque's largest benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger's stature as an entertainer has grown since he
flexed his pecs and flashed his smile in the 1977 documentary
``Pumping Iron,'' in which audiences met not one but two future
action stars (``The Incredible Hulk's'' Lou Ferrigno being the
other) in competition for the title of Mr. Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger's first feature-acting role came in ``Stay
Hungry,'' for which he received a Golden Globe Award for best
newcomer. Since then, he's piled up the credits in ``Predator,''
``Total Recall,'' ``True Lies,'' ``Conan the Barbarian'' and ``The
Terminator'' (pumped up by James Cameron's writing and direction).
Schwarzenegger also has tried his hand at comedy, doing the heavy
lifting in ``Jingle All the Way,'' ``Twins'' and ``Kindergarten
Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous recipients of the American Cinematheque Award include
Eddie Murphy, Bette Midler, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin
Scorsese, Sean Connery, Tom Cruise and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the black-tie dinner and awards show are available by
calling Kidd &AMP; Company at (310) 559-9334.
</P>
<P>
   WRONG NUMBER: The correct phone number for information on the
Festival of Preservation at UCLA is (310) 206-3456. (It was listed
incorrectly in this column last week). This impressive exhibition
of restored film and television productions is presented through
August.

SORREL PLAYS THE ECCENTRIC IN LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Evil? No, she's not evil. Just because she has
bludgeoned, shot, stabbed and poisoned several people, buried
another alive and had herself implanted with her ex-lover's sperm
and his lover's egg, that doesn't make Vivian Alamain evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just does what she has to do,'' says Louise Sorel,
describing the over-the-top character she's played for six years on
the high-rated soap opera ``Days of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's evil _ well, Hitler, Goebbels, that's
truly, truly evil. But human beings on the norm are not evil.
(Vivian) is eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   Eccentricity, in Sorel's book, is a good thing because it shows
you're ``taking life in.'' That's exactly what Sorel, a past winner
of Soap Opera Digest's Best Villainess Award, appears to be doing
with a vengeance these days.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of August, she'll be co-starring in the Odyssey
Theatre Ensemble's production of Terence McNally's ``A Perfect
Ganesh.'' First produced in New York four years ago, McNally's
dramatic comedy concerns two middle-age Connecticut women, each at
a critical life juncture, who journey through India in search of
self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with painful memories and unfulfilled ambitions, they
encounter a powerful intermediary in the form of Ganesh (pronounced
gay-naysh), the elephant-headed Hindu god who vanquishes obstacles.
Sorel plays the WASP-y, repressed Margaret, with Lois Nettleton as
the flightier, theatrical Katharine in director Allan Miller's
production.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sorel's first appearance on a Southern California stage
since her role last year in Brenda Krantz's ``Lovely'' at the Santa
Monica Playhouse. She admits the prospect was daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to do it, and I don't like that in myself,''
Sorel says. ``I'm not fearful of much of anything, except
earthquakes. I was intimidated and daunted by it, and I thought,
`That's why I have to do it.' Because there's some reason that he
(Miller) asked me to do this. If he thinks _ and I have great
respect for Allan _ if he thinks I can do this, I can do it. And I
question it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorel, an elegant, refined, soft-spoken beauty, was brought up
in the San Fernando Valley. She was formerly married to the late
Herb Edelman and the actor Ken Howard. Her father, film producer
Albert H. Cohen, marshaled such movies as ``Fighting Seabees,''
``East of Sumatra,'' ``Sign of the Pagan'' and ``Horizons West.''
Her mother was a pianist and painter whom Sorel describes as _ that
word again _ ``very eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, Sorel has made her home on a quiet
Westwood street, in a rustic apartment complex that might have been
airlifted from Paris' Montmartre district. Sorel's unit, set off a
flower-strewn central courtyard, is filled with trompe l'oeil
paintings, oversized marionettes, and other personalized touches
that give it the appearance of a 1920s salon. There's a
10-by-5-foot likeness of Paris' Tuilleries garden on her bedroom
wall, and the dining room table's surface has been painted to
appear as if it were covered with real place settings.
</P>
<P>
   She also maintains a one-bedroom apartment in New York City,
where she first broke into acting in the Broadway production ``Take
Her, She's Mine'' with Art Carney and Elizabeth Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this house _ wherever I've lived _ people have walked
in and sensed a lot of life,'' Sorel says. ``It's not just my life,
it's all the lives that have been in it. And I've always had a lot
of dinners and people in. I think that that's what life is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Her vibrantly cluttered digs also testify to the ``great
spareness in my emotional life'' that Sorel felt as a child, and to
``a great need for communication, which I didn't get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, she's in a home now, but she used to walk in here
and say, `Well, darling, is there anything else you might want to
put in this room?' She didn't get it. She thought I was nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   When director Miller first approached her about ``A Perfect
Ganesh,'' Sorel assumed she'd be playing Katharine, the role Zoe
Caldwell essayed in New York opposite Frances Sternhagen's
Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   It came as a shock when Miller, an old friend, told Sorel he'd
pegged her as Margaret. But now, Sorel says, she's absorbed in the
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Margaret is a woman who's bottled up so much in her
life. She's grown up in a way a lot of us do, which is to cover the
pain and not to really allow it to come to the surface, because
it's just too much to deal with. So that she has settled into a
certain life and accepted certain things that probably are not
acceptable anymore, for instance her marriage. She's in a marriage
with a man who's been having an affair for seven years, and she
hasn't dealt with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he knew that Margaret would be ``very tough.'' He
agrees with Sorel's assessment that he pushed the actress to go to
``a very dark place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only pushed her, I shoved her at least once! I asked her
to go someplace where she hadn't been in a long time. Actually, I
didn't do that push until the day before the first performance. So
we were building it.''
</P>
<P>
   But hasn't Vivian Alamain visited a few dark places in her time?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sorel agrees, but Vivian's behavior is insane and without
motive _ essentially a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I have no gimmicks in this play. I have no place to run.
It's my own demons that I'm dealing with, and certain deaths that
have occurred in my life in the last year or so that I'm bringing
to this play. And it's very painful. Really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   What's equally hard is that, after ``A Perfect Ganesh,'' Sorel
arrives home around 11 at night and has to memorize up to 25 pages
of script for next morning's 7 a.m. call (like most soaps, ``Days
of Our Lives'' shoots 52 weeks a year).
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it, Sorel says, to step outside the madwoman she
plays on TV. Yes, she'll willingly plead guilty to eccentricity _
but not insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think of myself as a nice Jewish girl, and people go,
`Oh, excuse me?!' And I think, `I'm very normal. I'm very
responsible. I take care of things. I go to work. I accomplish
things. I can do 20 things in a day that most people can't get
together.' So I think I'm just a normal person getting through
life. Evidently that isn't the case.''

GURR   FINDS   BLUESY   NICHE   IN   VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Local blues-funk guitarist Stevie Gurr has a few
points in his favor right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he spent much of the '80s recording and touring
with bluesman Elvin Bishop. Then the guitarist joined Dr. John's
band.
</P>
<P>
   Gurr has been living in the Valley Village area for a little
more than three years. His biweekly Wednesday night sessions at
Crazy Jack's in Burbank are drawing musicians from all over the
place, including prolific British session guitarist Chris Spedding,
who has been dropping by to jam lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvin was a total hero of mine,'' said Gurr, who grew up in
San Francisco. ``I used to see him and Boz Scaggs at the Fillmore
West.''
</P>
<P>
   As for playing with Dr. John (Mac Rebennack), Gurr recalls
backstage conversations between the New Orleans piano legend and
the band's equally renowned saxophonist, Red Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he and Mac would start talking about New Orleans in the
'50s, everybody would just shut up,'' Gurr said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurr, who also plays harmonica, is in San Francisco this
weekend, working with original Meters drummer Ziggy Modeliste. He
returns for his next date Wednesday at Crazy Jack's, 4311 W.
Magnolia Blvd., Burbank; (818) 845-1121.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are in L.A. more than in the Bay Area,''
Gurr said. ``Moving here was an emotional and financial hardship,
but I knew this was the place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   TOPLEY RISING: British singer-songwriter William Topley inspires
passion among his fans.
</P>
<P>
   His singles have topped the triple-A (album alternative) radio
charts, he was named third favorite artist by the Adult Rock Radio
panel _ behind Sarah McLachlan and the Wallflowers _ and was
proclaimed ``the new Van Morrison'' by the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best introduction to Topley's seductive sound is the
just-released ``Mixed Blessing'' (Mercury Nashville), which offers
a decade's worth of songs, including new material and several from
albums made when Topley was lead singer of the band the Blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked out the songs I thought worked well together,'' said
Topley, who appears Monday at the Viper Room, 8852 Sunset Blvd.,
West Hollywood; (310) 358-1880. ``It's not a greatest-hits record,
but the greatest hits within our little world.''
</P>
<P>
   During his years with the Blessing, Topley worked with late
Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy had some terrible problems, but he was also an
enormously warm and generous person,'' Topley recalled. ``He'd seen
so much talent and success in his travels, so to have him respond
to my music the way he did gave me a great deal of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO ROCKS: At 12:30 tonight, HBO broadcasts the season finale of
the music show ``Reverb,'' which features a 90-minute visit with
Green Day and the Foo Fighters taped in rainy Vancouver, British
Columbia.

   LOS ANGELES _ Watching a Robert Altman movie can be a
frustrating experience for moviegoers. In his four-decade career,
the maverick filmmaker has never been afraid to alienate critics
and/or audiences with his quirky and unconventional style.
</P>
<P>
   His latest film, ``The Gingerbread Man,'' recently hit video
stores, and the so-called legal thriller based on a John Grisham
script amply demonstrates Altman's faults and virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Known for overlapping dialogue, improvisation with actors,
restless camera movements and ironic takes on popular culture,
Altman has always been less concerned with plot points and
pyrotechnics than with _ let's call it _ his artistic big picture.
``The Gingerbread Man'' is typical of his films.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ as with many of Altman's films _ is almost
secondary. An amoral, high-priced lawyer, Rick Magruder (Kenneth
Branagh), has a one-night stand with a waitress, Mallory Doss
(Embeth Davidtz), who tells him her eccentric father, Dixon Doss
(Robert Duvall), is threatening her. Hooked on her, Magruder
quickly uses the resources of his firm to go to court and have
Dixon put away. When Dixon escapes from a mental institution with
the aid of a ragtag anti-government cult he leads, events spiral
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing is what it seems, and Magruder's attempt to
do the right thing _ protect Mallory and his children and then
later extricate himself from a murder rap _ quickly goes awry. The
plot echoes another Altman film, ``The Long Goodbye'' (1973), which
is undoubtedly the oddest interpretation of Raymond Chandler's
private detective Philip Marlowe (Elliott Gould) ever filmed. In
``Gingerbread Man,'' Altman has substituted an eery, rain-swept
Southern Gothic atmosphere for an L.A. cut flat by the sun and
colored by the smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye'' is the superior picture. Like ``Gingerbread,'' its
main character is a savvy guy who thinks he knows what's going on
but is sadly mistaken. Marlowe innocently gives his friend Terry
Lennox (former baseball pitcher Jim Bouton) a ride to Tijuana. Upon
returning to L.A., Marlowe finds that Lennox is wanted for killing
his wife and that he unwittingly helped him escape. Convinced
Lennox is innocent, he tries to find her real killer. Of course
(does this sound familiar?), nothing is what it seems, and things
quickly go awry.
</P>
<P>
   The films, like all of Altman's movies, are peppered with
offbeat performances. Altman encourages his actors to develop their
characters through improvisation, which is why he can attract
high-powered stars like Julia Roberts _ who had a cameo in ``The
Player'' (1992) and a starring role in ``Ready to Wear'' (1994). In
``Goodbye,'' besides the casting of Bouton, director Mark Rydell
does a memorable turn as a sadistic gangster, and Sterling Hayden
is a Hemingway-like novelist with writer's block. And one of
Rydell's thugs is played by Arnold Strong, who later went back to
his real name _ Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gingerbread,'' we have a stoned-out private detective,
played by Robert Downey Jr., and Duvall, who starred in two early
Altman films _ ``Countdown'' (1968) and ``MASH'' (1970), the
critical and box-office success that made Altman's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a painter, Altman developed many of his ideas and
themes early on and has explored them with a varying degrees of
success since. Look at ``MASH'' _ the overlapping dialogue was
there.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Altman's aim here? First, he's trying to give a
naturalistic feel to a scene. With people talking over each other
and multiple conversions going on, it may seem more real. It's a
technique that others have copied, but few will let a scene go on
and seem as unfocused as Altman. This is disturbing to many
filmgoers, but instead of trying to manipulate them, Altman has a
second purpose _ to give the audience a perspective on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's technique that is close to pure cinema _ the dialogue is
secondary to the picture. Altman isn't interested in you following
every word. He wants you to look at the whole picture _ the
different relationships _ instead of following a linear plot line.
</P>
<P>
   And much like repeated viewing of a masterpiece, repeated
viewing of the best Altman films yields interesting nuggets. On the
other hand, Altman will let scenes get away from him, perhaps
indulging himself and his actors with overly long takes.
</P>
<P>
   Altman at worst can still be interesting, too, because he's
always trying to subvert our expectation and open our eyes.
``Gingerbread'' _ despite some good performances and its creepy,
moody atmosphere _ is so-so Altman. But there are plenty of good
Altman films in the video stores to check out. Try ``MASH,''
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971), ``The Long Goodbye,'' ``Thieves
Like Us'' (1974), the underrated ``Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or
Sitting Bull's History Lesson'' (1976), ``3 Women'' (1977), ``The
Player'' (1992), ``Short Cuts'' (1993), ``Nashville'' (1975),
``Ready to Wear'' (1994) and ``Kansas City'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by that time, you'll buy into the Altman vision enough to
check out ``The Gingerbread Man.''

   The hotel chambermaid stood at my door, my size 10 black German
leather sandals in her dainty right hand. I'd left them in the
workout room under the Cybex leg-extension machine _ something I'd
never do in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you! Where would I be without my shoes?'' I gushed,
fishing five francs out of my coat pocket. Giggling, she took the
coin and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That night it was out with friends to their favorite pretty
little bistro. Till the wee hours, we feasted on rillettes de
sardines, Coquille St-Jacques in garlic and scallion sauce,
peppered pear dessert, sparkling wine and espresso _ and oui! _
massive quantities of billowing cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, my raw throat felt like a tractor had rolled
through it on caterpillar treads. My vision was blurred; I was
alternately sweating and freezing. Was I really going to be sick
all day? I glanced out the window. There was a huge poster for a
French opera company showing a sylph whirling in a pink tutu, and
someone had defaced it by spray-painting the giant words coming out
of her mouth: ``Bill Clinton, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for energy, I devoured the contents of my minibar: nuts,
chips, Toblerone, salami, cheese, yogurt (for the live cultures), a
banana. Then I fetched my PruCarePlus HMO Out-of-Network Service
Card. ``... Designated user must call provider immediately in case
of emergency ... if hospitalization or surgery is recommended,
please call 1-800- ...'' Another wave of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily my friends were home by the phone. They told me that in
France there is an ``S.O.S.-doctor'' program for emergencies, ``a
really nice service you can't have in America because the doctors
are too afraid of being sued for malpractice.'' The physicians make
old-fashioned house calls, even to your hotel room, they said.
''Just ask the reception desk. Tell them you need a doctor. They'll
call one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, okay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, Madame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick. I need a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooo ...''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, more torture. I imagined my mother's voice, saw her
forefinger waggling in my face: A strange man coming to my hotel
room? Why, he might be anyone! Maybe he was going to do terrible
things to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom. Right, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later I heard a knock, unbolted the door and
there, undoubtedly sent from heaven or Central Casting, was Doctor
Emile Mallereau, Medecine Generale: about 6 foot 3, firm square
jaw, wide shoulders, blue-green eyes, high forehead, ruddy skin,
wavy hair _ and yes, even a small black bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you zee patient?'' _ he entered with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, yes ... yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold?'' he winced. (Indeed, I had dialed the thermostat up as
far as possible and heaped three extra plaid blankets on the bed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Im afraid so,'' I said, tugging at my bathrobe. ``Is it
uncomfortable in here?'' _ trying to be the gracious hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what ez zee problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You speak English?'' I asked, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course.'' (Read: ``You dope, we all speak English; so
few of you speak French.'')
</P>
<P>
   I proceeded to tell him I was an American journalist on a
European tour interviewing world leaders about NATO expansion and
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah! A journalieeeste!'' he arched his noble eyebrows. ``But
NATO ... zee European Union'' _ shaking his head, the brow
furrowing _ ``Vee will hate zees single currency, zees Euro. Zees
eez bad for France. And why did not your Congress accept the bid
from Romania to join NATO? You take Poland but not Romania! Ah, it
makes me ill!''
</P>
<P>
   We adjourned to the mattress near the bedstand, which was
cluttered with my bottles of vitamins, antacids, melatonin,
chromium piccolate, calcium-magnesium tablets, aspirin and
sugar-free mints.
</P>
<P>
   Now Docteur Mallereau pointed to my robe and grey Hanes
sweatshirt. I took the hint. Over my head went the duds and there I
sat. Unphased, he began to poke and pummel my neck and arms _ as I
breathed deeply, inhaling, exhaling, sticking out my tongue,
coughing, turning, flexing my elbow, dilating my eyeballs _ as
doctors make you do the world over. ``Yes, ahem, oh my ....'' he
mumbled, wielding the cold stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him about my asthma, my chemical sensitivities,
how when the office cleaning lady uses polishes and sprays, I'm
always sure she's testing chemical weapons for a Third World army.
I wanted to tell him that perfume makes my face swell like a plum
and my mother chain-smoked and my brothers and I now can smell a
lit cigarette a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't say any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Madame Journaliste, what do you think of zees Monica
Lewinskee affair? You Americans are so ztrange, you want to
assassinate a good president. You do not want him to be human? Zees
ez very bad for the rest of zee world. Prime Minister Mitterrand
had a daughter and a wife and a mistress and we French were very
sophisticated about zat. But you are so funny about sex. I think we
French are with money as you are with sex!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, er ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus all zees noise about Saddam Hussein and zee weapons of
mass destruction. Zees winter Mees Madeleine Albright coming to
Paris for zee dialogue with Monsieur Vedrine _ no? Zey go to zee
Foreign Ministry with cupids on zee moldings and crystal
chandeliers and French flags. Very beautiful. But eet eez clear
this is but a distraction from zee president's problems!''
</P>
<P>
   I managed to splutter, ``We reelected him knowing he had, er,
fidelity issues. But he was supposed to BEHAVE. Not do it with an
INTERN, for Pete's sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah ... I see. Well, in any case, you have a bad bronchitis and
an influenza and a fever. You must stay in zees bed and watch your
TV,'' he motioned to the screen. Sound mute, it was on CNN
International.
</P>
<P>
   His prescriptions were for two bottles of effervescent aspirin,
a throat spray with a huge nozzle on top, cough syrup (the kind
that's so thick it warms your whole body after one swig) _ and 10
days' worth of 1,000mg packets of a strange orange-granulated brand
of erythromycin that looks like Tang. (You're supposed to mix it
with water and drink the fizz, but I found it tastier to eat dry
with a teaspoon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And so you live in Manhattan?'' he was asking, as I handed
back his emergency-call forms filled in with my vital data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you would know of a cheap apartment available for a
month in zee summer with a view of Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap? Across from Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here eez a business card'' _ he reached in his pocket. ``You
will call me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui! Merci!''

CLASSIC NICE GUY A CLASS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - After setting up a phone interview for 12:30 in the
afternoon, Bobby Sherman's publicist offers a friendly warning:
``He'll call you at 12:30 on the nose. He's very prompt.''
</P>
<P>
   Punctuality in pop stars is about as common as facial hair among
the Hanson brothers. But Sherman never was your typical pop star.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, most chart-toppers were tuning in and turning
on. Not the ``Shermanator.'' He parlayed a boyishly handsome face
and a likable singing voice into a string of hits that left
prepubescent girls screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tremendous responsibility,'' says Sherman, calling
from his Los Angeles home. ``I could have advocated sex and drugs
and all kinds of stupid stuff, but I knew better. The fans would
emulate everything you did, so I knew I had to be as clean-cut as I
possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sherman, this was no stretch. He wasn't David Cassidy, who
felt stifled by being sugary Keith Partridge. This was a mature man
who wasn't into trashing hotel rooms or baring it all for ``Rolling
Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up in a fairly strict family,'' he says. ``Law
and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember
other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things
just to be mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem cavity-inducing in print, but the friendly Sherman
sounds totally sincere. A classic nice guy, it's probably one
reason he enjoyed such monstrous success.
</P>
<P>
   He played sweet, stuttering Jeremy Bolt on the sitcom ``Here
Come the Brides.'' His off-screen exploits, carefully detailed in
``Tiger Beat,'' ``Fave'' and ``16'' magazines, were equally cuddly.
And since he was a grand old man in his late 20s during his run as
a teen idol, he was mature enough to carry the mantle with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much responsible in helping to bring up these
kids,'' he says. ``My life was kind of what they figured it to be.
There were never any skeletons or unpleasant surprises. I think it
became, `This guy's all right.' That's why I think it's nice for
them to go back to that era.''
</P>
<P>
   His concerts were marked by pandemonium in the late '60s and
early '70s. But once the hits stopped, he stopped touring. The
current ``Teen Idols Tour'' unites him with sometime Monkee Davy
Jones and Peter Noone, the geeky leader of Herman's Hermits. The
nationwide tour marks Sherman's first go-round on the road in more
than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the best time,'' he says. ``It's absolutely like
going back to the '70s. The fans are acting the same way they did
back then. It's like a proverbial love-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years on, the voice is still holding up, he says.
More importantly for some longtime fans out there, so is the body:
Middle-age fans squeal with delight when he comes out sporting
black leather trousers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still screaming,'' he says, not sounding boastful.
``They're singing right along. And I'm doing everything without any
difficulty. The songs are still in the same key and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the image of Sherman _ a choker on his neck, hair over
his eyes as he gazed into the camera _ is probably stronger than
the songs themselves. He admits simple sing-alongs such as ``Little
Woman'' and ``Julie, Do Ya' Love Me'' never will get him into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but that's all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hits, like ``La La La (If I Had You),'' ``Little
Woman,'' that was for a young audience. But we got a little more
upgraded as we went along. ``Easy Come, Easy Go,'' ``Cried Like a
Baby,'' those were really good songs. And all the fans want to hear
is the old stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sherman seems remarkably well-adjusted about his place in the
entertainment world, maybe it's because he doesn't live his life in
the show-biz bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Once the career slowed, he pursued other interests. After being
an emergency medical technician, he recently was sworn in as a
full-fledged member of the Los Angeles Police Department, serving
as a medical training officer. Obviously, he's no Danny Bonaduce if
he survived the LAPD background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any delusions of grandeur about wanting to be in
the limelight,'' says Sherman, who discusses the importance of CPR
from the concert stage. ``This business is all peaks and valleys. I
knew to secure my money and do other things I wanted. I had a knack
for first aid, and from that, it just snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 55, Sherman is simply a good guy. That's still his charm.
He never was the greatest singer or the best actor, but he was
someone people trusted. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine a
better man to carry those young girls through their first taste of
adolescent love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see some of the stuff on MTV now, it's bordering on
hard-core,'' says the divorced father of two grown sons. ``It's
kind of scary. We didn't have that back then. Now, the kids have
the Internet; then, they had ``Tiger Beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I don't think teen idols last so much anymore.
There's so much stuff going on, the kids' attention is diverted. I
think I lucked out. I wasn't born too late to enjoy that kind of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is never too late. He called at 12:30, on the nose. &QL;

GEARING UP FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL WOES

   All summer, our children have stayed up late, slept until noon,
used the heat as an excuse to be couch potatoes planted in front of
the TV all afternoon, and eaten mostly what and when they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But, smack in the middle of this lazy, hot summer break, it's
suddenly time to start thinking again of back-to-school concerns.
Half the health tips and news releases I've gotten in the past week
seem to have a back-to-school theme. Among the better ones:

<P>
   What's a parent to do with a child whose body clock isn't in
sync with alarm clocks, school bells and homework?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel Steinberg, vice president of medical affairs at
Children's Medical Center of Dallas, says we should start preparing
two weeks before the first day of school (it may already be too
late) to get our children back on schedule for fall classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start two weeks before the first day of school, and wake him
at the school wake-up time and expose him to natural light,''
Steinberg says. Getting a sleepy child up early and outside to play
is much better than forcing a nonsleepy child to go to bed early.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the child will begin to get sleepy earlier.

`FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES': IS A DEAD RAT AN OMEN, OR JUST A DEAD
RODENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for the killing of a large rat, almost nothing happens in
Jesse Peretz's somnolent, richly atmospheric debut film, ``First
Love, Last Rites,'' which is set in the Louisiana bayou country at
the steamy height of summer. That rat, of course, has to carry a
lot of symbolic weight.
</P>
<P>
   In several edge-of-sleep dream sequences, the sounds of the
creature scuffling behind the walls of a bare apartment conjure up
in the characters' minds pictures of rodent claws, blurred with
out-of-focus images of eels and swirling blood. By the time the rat
is beaten to death with a stick it has come to embody the lurking
doubts and fears that threaten to undermine a romantic summer
idyll.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's unlikely lovers are Joey (Giovanni Ribisi), a
sallow, skinny young man from Brooklyn who is inexplicably idling
away the summer in southern Louisiana, and Sissel (Natasha Gregson
Wagner), an attractive local girl whose parents have acrimoniously
separated for reasons that are never specified. Sissel's bratty
little brother, Adrian (Eli Marienthal), is always popping up at
inconvenient moments and throwing tantrums out of sheer boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows the course of a relationship that is the first
sexual affair for both partners, and it is adept at capturing the
rhythms and peevish undercurrents of a first-time sexual
relationship between lovers who are barely out of high school and
have nothing better to do than sprawl around and feel their
feelings. Sissel's father, Henry (Robert John Burke), a Vietnam
veteran who wants desperately to reunite with his wife, befriends
Joey and takes him hunting in the knee-deep waters of a swamp.
Henry conceives a get-rich-quick scheme in which he and Joey will
trap eels to be sold for sushi at fancy Japanese restaurants. Joey
dutifully sets about building eel traps out of chicken wire. While
he's building traps, Sissel begins a menial job at a local sugar
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Love, Last Rites'' was adapted from a 1975 story by Ian
McEwan, and it is an example of how the fiction of inference and
indirection resists being turned into a film. Peretz has transposed
the setting from an English industrial fishing town to the bayou
country around New Orleans. Although the geographical shift makes
for a film that is steeped in local color (this world of ruddy
tattooed fishermen and houses on stilts and crushing humidity is so
richly evoked you can almost smell the thick summer air), its main
characters seem distinctly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregson Wagner may be convincing as an indolent brooding
young everywoman, but she doesn't seem especially Southern, and
there's barely a hint of Brooklyn in Ribisi's Joey. These two
talented actors and the pesky rodent that symbolically gnaws away
at their bliss really belong in another movie, one not as
site-specific at this one.
</P>
<P>

CONTINENTAL CEO TELLS HOW HE PULLED AIRLINE OUT OF SPIRALING NOSE
DIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Continental Airlines Chief Executive Gordon Bethune saw it
four years ago, his company was going nowhere _ very fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a terrible company that did a lousy job of providing
service, paid its work force badly, barely managed to hold onto
disgruntled, unhappy employees long enough for them to drop
wrenches on their feet and file workers
</P>
<P>
   compensation claims, and lost so much money that (we) were
perilously close to our third (and no-doubt final) bankruptcy,'' he
frankly observed.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune's views are supported with even more blunt statistics of
that fateful year when he took over as CEO of the airline. At that
time:
</P>
<P>
   _Continental was dead last in on-time arrivals, measured by the
Transportation Department. The airline was also the worst in
mishandled baggage and received more complaints than any airline _
almost three times the industry average, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   _Continental had 10 years of consecutive losses and had gone
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection twice. In 1994, it lost $204
million, and its stock was at ``rock bottom,'' Bethune said,
trading at $3.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   _Continental employees were paid far below industry average.
On-the-job injuries, turnover and sick leave were ``astronomical.''
The company culture was ``dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   A pretty dismal portrait of one of the 10 largest airlines in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a change in management can make. Bethune
took over as CEO in November 1994 _ the 10th chief executive in as
many years. He had some strong ideas about leadership, and he was
ready to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now move forward to Continental today:
</P>
<P>
   _Since 1995, the airline's on-time performance has been in the
top five nearly every month, often first; lost-baggage claims are
among the top two or three best and customer complaints are below
the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   _Customers have returned, making the airline profitable. In
1995, Continental made $202 million in profit; in 1996, $556
million. The past 11 quarters have each been more profitable than
the one before. The stock has climbed rapidly, splitting 2-for-1,
and now is trading at more than $50.
</P>
<P>
   _And the work force is content. Wages have gone up 25 percent,
sick leave is down 29 percent, turnover is down 45 percent and
workers compensation claims are down 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, trade journal Air Transport World called Continental
the 1996 Airline of the Year out of more than 300 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you turn around a $6 billion, 200-airplane,
international airline in such a short time?
</P>
<P>
   Bethune discusses that challenge with a refreshingly frank and
insider view in his book ``From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes
of Continental's Remarkable Comeback'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 294
pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   He started by sitting at his dinner table with Greg Brenneman, a
consultant who later became Continental's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   There Bethune and Brenneman created the Go Forward Plan, a broad
strategy with two lofty goals: to improve the product and to change
the culture. The plan targeted four areas: markets, financial,
product and people.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle was grabbing the CEO spot and selling the plan
to Continental's board of directors, a passage vividly described by
Bethune. (When originally voted down as CEO, Bethune writes: ``I
consider it a great testimonial to skull design that my head did
not at that moment explode.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the board came around, and then Bethune faced customers,
management and employees with a myriad of practical, but profound,
changes at the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes such as canceling unprofitable routes, changing
pricing structure, refinancing debts and renegotiating leases had
profound effects, which seems obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But so did casual dress day every Friday, monthly open house at
the executive suites for all employees, burning the old conduct
manual, and issuing a $65 bonus in every month that the airline's
Transportation Department performance rating improved.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Bethune tells us that effective CEOs are not
dictators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your real job as boss _ my real job as chief executive _ is to
let people do their jobs. It's to assemble the right team, set the
big-picture direction, communicate that, and then `get out of the
way,''' he writes. ``A boss's job _ a leader's job _ is to
facilitate, not to control. You have to trust people to do their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how you turn around a company.
</P>

   &UR; ARE U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Morihiro Hosokawa &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>

ALL ABOARD FOR ADVENTURE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA'S MERGUI ARCHIPELAGO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ANDAMAN SEA-HOW TO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE ANDAMAN SEA _ The journey promised adventure, but we didn't
know the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sailing through waters off the coast of Myanmar _
formerly known as Burma, and shut off from the outside world for
the past half-century _ seduced nine intrepid travelers who had
previously done plenty of exploring in exotic places. Here was a
chance to investigate a tiny part of the world inhabited only by
sea gypsies and by wild monkeys and other assorted beasts, a
section of Southeast Asia that was last effectively documented when
European traders came from India to explore the famous Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   So, in October, when we boarded the trimaran appropriately named
the Wanderlust, we were among the first 100 Westerners to take such
a voyage since Burmese officials opened their part of the Andaman
Sea _ in the easternmost Indian Ocean _ to outsiders late in 1996.
Our specific destination was the Mergui Archipelago, a group of
some 800 islands covering 10,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to an area rampant with political and profound
financial troubles was less daunting because our sailing outfitter
had been running this particular trip for nearly a year. What
little we could find ahead of time on the Internet looked pretty
good.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that our captain was Adam Frost, an Englishman who
owns and runs the sailing company from Phuket, Thailand, along with
his mother and brother. They have operated scuba diving trips in
Thai and Indonesian waters for five years, and they seemed certain
we wouldn't be accosted by Burmese pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the Wanderlust from our American homes took nearly 40
hours of travel. But we immediately experienced the first of many
thrills to come as we listened to Burmese monks chanting in odd
cadence from the mountaintop temple above the port, where a giant
reclining Buddha watched over us. We squeezed around the tiny table
in the sailboat's salon, dining on an exquisite feast magically
prepared in a pint-sized galley by our 18-year-old Thai chef.
</P>
<P>
   It rapidly became clear that the Wanderlust is not for people
who demand comfort: The bunks were scarcely larger than a dresser
drawer, and heat and humidity were phenomenal, even though October
is the ``coolest'' month in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the nine of us shared good humor along with a
thirst for adventure. This came in handy when it was time to visit
the one head, which was the size of an airplane's bathroom and had
a shower operated by pumping a foot lever. The whole showering
thing, in fact, was highly entertaining; when washing away the
shampoo, we had to stick our heads under the nozzle and work the
lever behind us _ kicking much like a donkey would.
</P>
<P>
   Such inconveniences vanished from memory the moment we awoke the
first morning in a dreamlike spot called Crescent Bay. From the
deck we gazed across bottle-green water at odd little birds called
island thick-knees skittering around on a cream-colored beach.
Beyond the sand rose dense rain-forest jungle, clinging thickly to
giant granite hills.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning and afternoon were consumed by snorkeling forays.
Most of us had already snorkeled from the Caribbean to Australia,
and still we thought the Andaman Sea was more impressive. Because
no divers have been there to disturb nature, its reefs teemed with
Technicolored coral and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Each underwater journey offered views of exotic fish:
tiger-striped wrasses, big parrotfish colored bright green, cobalt,
pink and purple, gorgeous angelfish and Moorish idols, which had
fantastically long ribbons of dorsal fins. Some of these, said the
experienced diver in our group, were rare sights even to her.
</P>
<P>
   And there were extraordinary coral palettes in which the fish
live. The best we saw were just off Fire Beach and Cavern Island,
where the reefs were crowned not only by elkhorn and brain coral
but fat purple sea anemones and bushes of bright green coral.
</P>
<P>
   The two scuba divers on our boat went exploring twice a day,
finding several black-tipped reef sharks, huge moray eels, lobster
and wahoo. One morning as we anchored off Kyun Pila, an island in
the Great Swintons, we saw dozens of squid just off the bow of the
Wanderlust. And the afternoon we were anchored off Clara Island at
a spot we named GNT Beach (for Adam's favorite drink, gin and
tonic), one of our snorkelers found a lovely rare blue starfish
among the rocks near shore.
</P>
<P>
   Because there would be stretches of time when there was no wind,
leaving us feeling as though we were boiling inside our skin, we'd
just stay in the water for hours at a time. Sometimes we'd just
float around the Wanderlust in the late afternoon and watch
hornbills, sea eagles and Brimmany kites sailing the skies and
diving for dinner.

SQUIRREL NUT ZIPPERS SWING TO THEIR OWN BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHY CANO-MURILLO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - One evening as musician Jim Mathus relaxed at home, he
decided to teach his wife a cute vintage song on the banjo. It was
at that moment that he noticed something very peculiar about his
soulmate.
</P>
<P>
   She had one of the strangest singing voices he had ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Other husbands may have firmly, but lovingly, asked her to
refrain from such refrains. Mathus, however, chose to build a band
around her sleepy song stylings.
</P>
<P>
   He named the group after a vintage candy bar, and the seeds of
the Squirrel Nut Zippers were planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite odd how it all happened,'' says Katherine Whalen,
the now-seasoned vocalist of the Cotton Club-inspired band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never sang a note in front of anyone,'' she says from
the couple's North Carolina home. ``I knew I had a funny-sounding
voice, so I always held it in and ended up as a groupie, never once
even considering myself as a singer. So when Jim told me his plans
for this new band featuring me as the singer _ I was absolutely
terrified!''
</P>
<P>
   Whalen chats candidly with a charming Southern drawl as she
recounts the nerve-racking yet fun days of the band's infancy. For
starters, the couple quit their serving jobs at a local restaurant
so they could take the show on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They were already living in the past, favoring ragtime sounds,
classic artwork and even a refurbished home. Translating that love
of retro into songs came naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Mathus spent hours writing and practicing pseudo-swing tunes as
Whalen diligently worked on her stamina for public crooning. The
band has come a long way since its first gig four years ago,
appearing at a North Carolina bistro.
</P>
<P>
   In those four years, the concept has taken off faster than a
flapper's fancy footwork. The band's flair with trombones, violins,
pedal steel guitars and slap-happy rhythms was new to the ears of
flannel-wearing grunge heads and mainstream radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Zippers, their efforts have coincided with a
tidal wave of old-fangled acts such as Cherry Poppin' Daddies, the
Brian Setzer Orchestra and Royal Crown Revue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been really lucky,'' Whalen says. ``People really like
it or they just don't vocalize their dislikes. It's fun to see
their faces open up and blossom when we begin to play onstage.
Especially when they are expecting some rock band, then we come
bursting out with our ukuleles.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent and charm of the Squirrel Nut Zippers have garnered
them a long-term contract with Mammoth Records. They also have
enjoyed a platinum album (1996's ``Hot``), countless tours, stints
on national television, plenty of radio airplay, multiple songs on
movie and television soundtracks and _ most importantly _ a
juke-joint reputation for being the '90s band to resurrect the
Charleston dance.
</P>
<P>
   But despite ever-growing attention, members have managed to stay
comfortably humble.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen contends that it's not superstar fame that motivates the
band, but love of music. One of Whalen's goals is to remain
successful enough to retire the crew with no financial worries.
Thanks to a barrage of positive reviews for the band's lastest
effort, ``Perennial Favorites,'' that goal shouldn't be difficult
to attain.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen confesses she sometimes thinks about becoming a parent as
well as about those bygone waitressing days. But she is quickly
reminded of the fortunes this project has brought.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks her musical adventure could be a song in itself, and
she has the perfect way to listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love for people to hear our music on AM radio _
driving in an old convertible down a dirt road, right by a lake and
under full moonlight,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the Squirrel Nut Zippers are all about.'' &QL;

THE ANDAMAN SEA: diving for dinner. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sole exciting brush with wildlife came at daybreak on the
third morning. Anchored about 200 yards from the shore in a
gorgeous, covelike channel called Salet Galet, we watched as a
large family of monkeys wandered out of the jungle to the beach. We
could hear parental screeching and baby monkeys crying for food in
the woods, while some adults explored. A couple of them bathed at
the water's edge and dug around for clams. We were mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'' were the curiosity when we ventured onto Palau Nala, the
island occupied by a sea gypsy village. Some 300 or so of the
Moken, or sea gypsies, live there in shacks built on stilts. Every
few years, they'll move from one island to another, but they seem
fairly rooted at present. The Burmese government provides them with
diesel fuel and rice, and the fishermen make a living selling
nasty-looking dried sea cucumbers (also called sea worms) to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Because Adam has forged a friendship with the Burmese monk in
residence, we were welcome to visit for about an hour, walking
through the village, observing a group of women busy with some kind
of gambling on a blanket in the stifling heat. We listened to Adam
have a brief conversation with the monk about, we presumed, food
and health. We didn't speak Thai or Burmese, so they might have
been discussing the Florida Marlins' chances at winning the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   We later asked Adam if visits to the sea gypsy village are
conscionable _ or are we making a human zoo of the Moken? He
disputed that any exploitation is involved. On his weekly visits,
Adam brings medicine, rice and other goods that the monk has
requested, and nothing is taken from the residents or their island.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the outside world has touched the Moken in other ways.
Some of the exquisitely beautiful children were dressed in such
Western garb as Bugs Bunny T-shirts, and then there's the enormous
satellite dish, rising from behind the monk's home over the cove.
They have their MTV.
</P>
<P>
   FREE AS A WELL-FED BIRD: There was almost no structure to the
entire trip _ other than meals, of course. One sunset as we sipped
white wine, one woman in our group said she couldn't recall another
time when she had felt so free. She observed that with no schedule
to keep, our days simply revolved around three meals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we woke up, ate, put on sunblock, snorkeled, ate, read,
snorkeled again, wrote letters, took notes, ate, quizzed Adam about
the islands and slept. Day in, day out.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfasts were usually tidy, individual omelets made with ham,
cheese and tomatoes, or poached eggs and bacon, or fried eggs with
tomatoes and cheese, and toast. Lunch one day consisted of
delicious hamburgers and french fries, while fabulous fried chicken
and mashed potatoes were another noon meal. At every lunch our chef
_ who goes by the nickname ``Boy'' because his proper name is the
less manageable Boontun Nimala _ would include a huge, leafy salad.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening meal _ which in proper Thai home-style tradition is
a soup and three separate dishes of beef, pork and fish _ consisted
of courses like beef with lobster sauce and oyster mushrooms, green
curry with chicken, and prawns with pineapple or beef with red
curry and pumpkin or turnips, or sweet and sour fish soup. Rich or
robust flavors were provided by Boy's masterful ways with fresh
ginger, galangal, cilantro, basil, mint, curries, coconut milk,
lime and lemongrass. And in typical Thai style, Boy decorated every
dish with intricately carved chiles, carrots, tomatoes and
cucumbers, which he fashioned into floral wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Boy was sparing with chiles, but gradually he jacked
up the heat. The two chiles he most often used were the long green
and red ones called ``prik chiba,'' and the smaller, thin ones _
that are often alarmingly mistaken by Westerners for green beans _
called ``prik kee ngoe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the second evening, we found ourselves sweating profusely
through our magnificent dinner _ from the intense heat in both the
salon and the chiles. Our good manners disappeared; we would wolf
down the divine food and mumble over the flavors before scrambling
to the deck the moment we finished the final bite.
</P>
<P>
   It's over so soon
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth day we were relaxed to the point of asking Adam if
it was Wednesday or Thursday. There were no cell phones, no faxes,
no television. The two electronic devices we noticed were the CD
player, on which Adam sometimes played Sheryl Crow or Ella
Fitzgerald, and Adam's laptop, which he used in the evenings to
update his log.
</P>
<P>
   We were stunned to find ourselves back in the Burmese port of
Kawthong on the sixth morning. Although we relished the idea of
real showers and beds, our adventure seemed much too short. We'd
gotten used to the heat, and the donkey-kick shampoo affair had
even become fun. We really had no idea what adventurers we could
be.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - When Dad's the host of a game show that has the words
``Big Ass'' in its name, expect to get away with more stuff than
most kids.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the predicament of Bobcat Goldthwait's 16-year-old
stepson, fresh off a weekend of partying while Game Show Host Dad
was away doing his other job, Stand-Up Comedian Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apparently had some sort of hootenanny at my house when I
was out of town,'' says Goldthwait, who also has a daughter. ``I'm
just finding the wreckage of that. It's going to be very hard for
me to keep a straight face and be upset over that. `How'd you have
a party and didn't invite your dad or his friends?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like stepson.
</P>
<P>
   Although Goldthwait, 36, has done stand-up for more than half of
his life, only recently has he worked his other job, that of host
of ``Bobcat's Big Ass Show,'' which runs weeknights on the FX cable
channel. Contestants reveal embarrassing secrets and talents,
apparently of their own volition. Whether the modifier ``Big Ass''
refers to the show or to its contestants is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldthwait is a stranger to outrageous behavior.
Remember, this is the same guy who, in 1994, smashed up the set on
``The Arsenio Hall Show'' and set a couch ablaze on ``The Tonight
Show With Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Try explaining that to your children. ``Kids, Daddy had too many
Twinkies that night. Actually, both nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldthwait is a stranger to explaining his outrageous
behavior, either. After the first few televised acts of
destruction, the admonition ``Do as I say, not as I do'' becomes
somewhat implicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I haven't had to give that speech,'' he says. ``Once I
did, and (my stepson) asked me, `Are you really going to tell me
with a straight face not to act up in class?' I'm like going,
`Yeah, you're right. But you better work it out with this lady
because I don't want to come over here anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The game show marks a resurgence of sorts for Goldthwait, who
landed roles in various comedies in the '80s, including ``Police
Academy 2,'' ``3'' and ``4'' and ``Scrooged.'' In 1991, he took his
first stab at writing and directing with ``Shakes the Clown,''
which achieved cult status but little more.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a bit of a lull thereafter but recently has taken up
various projects, such as the voice for Mr. Floppy, a stuffed bunny
that comes to life in the WB show ``Unhappily Ever After.'' He also
was the voice of Pain in the animated Disney film ``Hercules'' and
is working on writing and directing another film, ``Teen Jesus,''
described by Goldthwait as ``Jerusalem, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is in addition to taping five episodes of the game show
each Wednesday and Thursday and spending weekends doing stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always doing so many different things that it's kind of
hard to get bored,'' he says. And if boredom ever does set in, he
could always party with his stepson. &QL;

   INSTALLATION-ART (Undated) _ I still recall Gary Hill's
installation at Documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany, with pleasure, even
if it was a little hokey: in the middle of the show, his work was a
sanctuary behind blackout curtains, a long room of videotaped
images of people who seemed to emerge from the darkness like
ghosts, looking out at us, smiling, frowning or whatever, then
retreating as if in a dream. That was six years ago. Since then,
what was no longer uncommon even at that time has become so
commonplace that very often it has passed beyond cliche to parody:
installation art is in the late 90s roughly what Abstract
Expressionism was by the late 50s. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).

   ROBBINS-FANCY-FREE (subslug) (Undated) _ Jerome Robbins was an
everyday presence in my dancegoing life from early on. I saw his
three sailors on the town in ``Fancy Free'' as a child shortly
after he created this ballet, his first, in 1944. It appealed to
children and grown-ups alike. Ballet had already seduced me with
Act II of ``Swan Lake.'' But ``Fancy Free,'' like all Robbins
works, opened a door. It let me know at a very young age that
ballet had a wide horizon and was not limited to a single type of
theatrical experience. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved).

   HENSLEY-OKLAHOMA-MUSICAL (London) _ In a New York theater
climate that regularly welcomes Britons, famous or otherwise _
whether Ralph Fiennes or Eddie Izzard _ there is something
particularly gratifying about an American unknown causing a stir in
London. And a Georgia-born baritone named Shuler Hensley most
definitely is doing just that as the menacing Jud Fry in the Royal
National Theater's current revival of ``Oklahoma!'' By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   LONDON-THEATER (subslug) (London) _ Any theater historian will
tell you that the 1943 ``Oklahoma!'' was crucial to the evolution
of the Broadway musical and, doing so, leave you wondering if you
honestly wish to see it revived. Trevor Nunn, the Royal National
Theater's director, is staging the Rodgers and Hammerstein's
musical in the Olivier auditorium this summer. By Benedict
Nightingale. (Moved).

<P>
   LONDON-THEATER-DESIGNERS (London) _ Anthony Ward and Mark
Thompson often have designed shows that opened during the same
season, and sometimes _ at the Royal Shakespeare Company in
Stratford-on-Avon, for instance _ even in the same week. But the

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BEVERLY-HILLS-FILM (Los Angeles) _``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a
film that Ms. Tamara Jenkins wrote and directed, is a 70s-era tale
about the coming of age of 15-year-old Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha
Lyonne). In it, Vivian and her two brothers are being schlepped by
their 60-something father (Alan Arkin) from one thin-walled,
furniture-deprived domicile to the next, each barely within the
90210 ZIP code so as to afford them access to superior public
schools. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD-HEART-FILM (subslug) (Undated) _ When ``Dead Heart'' played
in Australia in 1996, Nicholas Parsons's film, about a highly
charged confrontation between white and aboriginal cultures at Wala
Wala, a remote settlement in the desert 50 miles west of Alice
Springs, was about to fade away from art houses when discussion of
it on a Sydney talk show helped extend its run to 20 weeks. In this
country, ``Dead Heart'' received favorable reviews but disappeared
quickly, in the manner of many good little films. Now it is back on
a videotape from Fox Lorber. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).

   MCKAYLE-DANCE (Undated) _ The choreographer Donald McKayle can
be as difficult to locate as he is to classify. Instead of staying
in one place, he shuttles between New York and California. Rather
than create dances for just one medium, he regularly invents them
for Broadway, television, film and the concert stage. By Valerie
Gladstone. (Moved).

<P>
   PHRYGIAN-GATES-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may disturb the composer
John Adams that his operas have not been revived, as reported in
these pages, but there is a grain of consolation: ``Phrygian
Gates,'' a 20-year-old piano work by Adams, is apparently becoming
a favorite of new-music pianists. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FUTURISM-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Russian Futurism,'' five compact
disks in three packages from Arte Nova, appropriates a title to
which it may not be entitled. Futurism had a distinct time, place
and description, and none of the music offered here fits the last
two of these. The visual arts were futurism's focus; the musical
arm survives in accounts of it. Aside from an all but
undecipherable shellac record, this brief, brave movement came and
went, leaving only its ideas behind. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LATE-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ A short while ago I suggested
that an orchestra could operate for 10 years playing only music
written during the last three decades. That claim was meant to
indicate how much excellent music has been composed during this
time, not to put forward a real proposal for orchestral planning.
For one thing, homogeneous programs are generally less interesting
than mixed ones, which can put a new or recent piece into a useful
perspective. To hear Elliott Carter in the company of Bach, say, or
Steve Reich alongside Stravinsky, will shed light not only on the
newer music but also on the older. By Paul Griffith. (Moved).

   ZAHA-HADID-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Zaha Hadid's design for the
Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati won't be officially unveiled
until this October, but surely I'm not the only one impatient for a
preview. And in fact the design is already far enough along to
praise Cincinnati for giving this remarkable architect her first
commission in the United States. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLATION-ART-COLLECTORS (subslug) (Undated) _ Some
contemporary art collectors are so unfazed by installation-size
works that they would very likely buy Uranus if they could get God
to come and properly install it. But there is one artist still
largely beyond their grasp: Ann Hamilton. Ms. Hamilton, 42, an
Ohioan whose work is perhaps the most elaborate of all, sells her
installations only to museums. By Nancy Hass. (Moved).

   PRESIDENTS-LOVE-EXHIBIT (Yorba Linda, Calif.) _ The item in the
newspaper appeared in a listing for museum shows. ``Come see
Hillary Rodham Clinton's wedding gown,'' the tiny print said.
``We're just an hour from Los Angeles.'' his was an announcement
from the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace here in Yorba Linda.
I called to double-check. Was it a prank perpetrated by one of the

from 1 to 10. There might be an exploded 3-D pie chart or a Venn

concession, however, to those of you suffering from late-millennial
list addiction, here: No. 17 _ Fred Mertz, No. 18 _ The Bay of

`MARIE BAIE DES ANGES': RESTLESS AS TEENS IT POR TRAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 BAIE-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If ``Marie Baie des Anges'' had been made in
Hollywood, it would make no sense at all. Instead, it's a French
film that makes no sense at all. But c'est la vie _ who needs sense
when you're French?
</P>
<P>
   This impressionistic rumination on the sexuality and violence of
French youth will challenge moviegoers who look for coherence in
their stories, but will reward the fewer viewers who value an
interior, psychological approach to cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set among a restless group of teenagers on the
French Riviera, most of them portrayed by non-actors. Because they
spend most of their scenes staring stonily into the camera, their
naturalness is no stonier than professional actors might have
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The film deals primarily, when it deals with anything at all,
with the unspoken attraction between Marie (Vahina Giocante) and
Orso (Frederic Malgras).
</P>
<P>
   Marie is a teenage girl spending a summer at the seashore
flirting with all the boys, particularly some older American
sailors, who always seem ominous. But then so does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous of all is Orso, a wandering teenage thief. He may
also be a killer, but because most of the scenes of what might be
violence are shot through dark shadows, it's difficult to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Marie and Orso glance off each other a number of times, while
each pursues some enigmatic purpose. They eventually adhere, and
their coastal romance is both as pretty as the seashore and as
dangerous as the legend of the angels who live in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The angels referred to in the movie's title are a mysterious
kind of shark that both protects and kills.
</P>
<P>
   French filmmaker Manuel Pradal, making his first movie, is
consumed with the dichotomy of seduction and violence, which he
doesn't illuminate but glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   Pradal succeeds only as long as he keeps us enmeshed in his
mysterious purposes. I didn't stay caught up for long.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the film's difficult allure is the
unfortunate subtitling. Because the movie takes place during a
French summer, many of the characters wear white clothes. Thus,
we're often subjected to subtitles playing in white on white. Add
in all the scenes shot in the dark, and the dark nature of Pradal's
purpose, and we have a movie that's not only difficult to grasp,
it's hard to see.
</P>
<P>
   What comes through, however, is a disturbing portrait of French
youth as hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for profanity, violence and nudity, ``Marie Baie des
Anges'' is in French with English subtitles. 2 stars. &QL;

<P>
   Getting there, we found out, was step one in the adventure.
After long flights to Bangkok (about 25 hours from Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport), there was an hour's flight to Phuket, an island in
southern Thailand. From the Phuket town of Patong, it's a five-hour
ride in a minivan to Ranong, a Thai town with a smelly port. There
we piled into a long boat with all our luggage and took a 45-minute
trip across the Pakchan River, propelled by a crude motor not
unlike that on a lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   The long boat took us directly to the Wanderlust, anchored in
the harbor at Kawthong, the port in Myanmar from which we sailed.
Adam Frost, our captain, spent two hours in government offices with
our passports and the $80-U.S.-per-guest entry fee. Before he
returned to the Wanderlust, he'd had to visit with 28 different
``officials,'' to whom he must give whiskey and cigarettes upon
each visit. That's just part of the game, he says. No one seems
certain if or when the Burmese will lighten up or if they'll shut
down again.
</P>
<P>
   Adam owns Southeast Asia Live-Aboards, the company we booked our
trip with, with his brother and mother; they've been sailing off
the coast of Myanmar since January 1997. SEA Live-Aboards was the
first diving/sailing outfit to obtain permission to do business
from the Burmese, a process that took a couple of frustrating years
of negotiations. Their company has already enjoyed five years of
success with similar trips in Thai and Indonesian waters.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for the sailing adventure cruise we took, which
operates year-round, is $850 from mid-October until mid-May, and
$680 the balance of the year. This includes all meals, lots of
bottled water, Burmese entry fees, and snorkeling and diving gear.
Soft drinks are $1 and beer is $2 extra. You must bring your own
wine and spirits. Prices are not affected by the shaky Thai
economy, the owners say, because the captains and sailboat expenses
have always been paid in U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   SEA Live-Aboards also offers diving trips with three daily dives
in the Mergui Archipelago, and in Thai, Indian and Indonesian
waters. For information on SEA Live-Aboards, call 011-66-76-340406,
or visit its Web site at www.sealiveaboards.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other Phuket-based companies now sailing the Mergui are Dive
Phuket (www.divephuket.com), Fantasea Divers Co. Ltd. (e-mail at

 &HT;    'BOUNTY' REDUCES WELFARE PAYMENTS TO PRISONERS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A ``bounty program'' that pays sheriffs' offices
and prisons for alerting the federal government when prisoners are
improperly receiving Supplemental Security Income payments has
stopped checks to 17,280 inmates over the past 15 months, the
government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The law has always denied SSI benefits to people held for more
than a month in a public institution such as a prison or mental
hospital, but until 1996 it relied on individuals to notify the
government that they were not entitled to benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare reform law included the bounties for agencies
notifying the government _ by providing lists of prisoners which
can be checked against Social Security records _ of inmates who may
be ineligible for benefits. The bounty is paid to the institution,
not to individual law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is expected to save $3.5 billion over seven
years, according to David Williams, the Social Security
Administration's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for taxpayers and horrible news for
convicts who were illegally getting welfare and Social Security
checks in jail,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican
who spearheaded the reform bill. ``This shows that creative and
common-sense solutions like our bounty system can stop fraud cold.
If you're doing time, you don't get a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., a co-author of the bounty
provision, noted that pending bills supported by the Clinton
administration would expand the notification system to cut off
benefits for other programs, such as food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemental Security Income is paid to about 6.6 million poor
Americans, most of them blind, aged or disabled. In most cases,
inmates may qualify for SSI payments if they are poor and mentally
or physically disabled.

 Deanne Stillman is the author of a play called ``Inside in the
White House''  
 By DEANNE STILLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YORBA LINDA, Calif. _ The item in the newspaper appeared in a
listing for museum shows. ``Come see Hillary Rodham Clinton's
wedding gown,'' the tiny print said. ``We're just an hour from Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an announcement from the Richard Nixon Library and
Birthplace here in Yorba Linda. I called to double-check. Was it a
prank perpetrated by one of the old Watergate plumbers? The
recording explained everything: the establishment was presenting
the exhibition ``My Dearest Partner,'' all about husbands and wives
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of love and romance at the Nixon museum sounded
almost surreal: could passion exist, even in souvenir form, at an
archive devoted to a man whose passions were remote and covert?
Passion in the White House _ between spouses?
</P>
<P>
   You never know. I had been meaning to visit the museum, if only
to see the Nixon bird feeder, which I had heard was available in
the gift shop. But now that (italics)other(end italics) dress _ of
the blue cocktail variety _ was in the news. Nevermind the odd
Nixoniana, I decided, now was the time: I must see Mrs. Clinton's
gown.
</P>
<P>
   What had the First Lady got married in? I wondered as I drove
past an endless chain of strip malls featuring Chuck E. Cheese. Was
it very feminine? Did it have a long train? Silk or satin? I could
not conjure an image.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I arrived, I made a beeline for the area dedicated to
the Clintons. There was the gown, walled up behind plexiglass, a
peculiar artifact that Mrs. Clinton evidently deemed suitable for
framing.
</P>
<P>
   A simple affair, it was a long-sleeved, full-length, cotton
hippie wedding dress (circa 1975) gathered at the bust, with a
scooped neck. I guess it could be referred to as Shaker style. An
annotation next to the dress explained its provenance: ``found by
Hillary Rodham's parents in a local Fayetteville department
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down inside, Mrs. Clinton is a flower child, I thought, and
a low-maintenance one at that. Perhaps the woman who seems to be
ruffled by nothing wilted a long time ago, covering it all up with
a steely smile. I thought I heard Nixon's ghost talking to the
First Lady: ``You could have been top banana, but you stood by your
man. I forgive you for your part in the Watergate hearings, but if
there's one thing I support it's family values.''
</P>
<P>
   But then a more recent photograph near the dress told another
story. Taken at the Arkansas governor's mansion in 1992 by Harry
Benson, it is the highlight of the show, so surprisingly sweet and
intimate that the Clintons would be well-advised to circulate it
immediately. Bill is lying in a hammock, gazing dreamily at his
wife. Hillary is bending down close, looking happy and seductive
and beautiful; the moment appears to be the prelude to a kiss. They
are in love, and it seems like a million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And then came more surprises. There were relics from the love
affair between Harry and Bess Truman, including ``trench art,'' or
engraved artillery casings, which Harry sent to Bess from the front
at Verdun in World War I, as well as a love letter he wrote after
he was elected president. ``Dear Bess,'' he penned on White House
stationery, ``Twenty-nine years! It seems like 29 days ... What an
old fool I am.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a note from Lyndon Johnson regarding Lady Bird,
written to a friend: ``I love that woman and she wants that Highway
Beautification Act ... By God, were going to get it for her.''
</P>
<P>
   At the display for the Bush presidency, I was struck by evidence
of girlishness in the First Lady, and how much in love the Bushes
were long ago. On display was a pair of Keds, mismatched _ the
right one was pink; the left, floral _ given to Barbara by the
president. I wondered if I would have thought differently of the
Bushes if I had known that George named his World War II fighter
plane after his betrothed.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``why would anyone save this?'' category were kernels of
rice thrown at Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower at their wedding, as
well as a powder puff that said ``Mamie,'' and a tube of Mamie's
trademark ``Parisian Red'' lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   I liked this diorama, rice and all. Whether or not Ike liked
someone else, as has long been chatted about, became irrelevant;
Mamie tried to look good. With Parisian Red, there was always hope.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Richard and Pat Nixon were well represented, with
lots of love mementoes available for viewing. On May Day 1940, the
young law student Richard had a diamond engagement ring _ on
display here _ delivered in a flower-filled May basket to the
classroom of his intended. So here was another oddly heartening
moment in this show _ Nixon sweaty, but hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   The sexiest item in this exhibit is a dark-blue silk bodice
given to Rachel Jackson by her husband, Andrew, shortly before he
became president. With black overlace, scalloped edges, and black
ribbon trim, it suggests that here was a man who was looking
forward to long nights of frolic in the White House. Alas, this was
not to be: Rachel died of a heart attack three weeks before the
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   I looked for mention of extramarital affairs in the exhibit _
after all, we hear about more of those than of conjugal bliss in
the White House; happiness has now become the secret rather than
the facade _ but there was not one reference, not even to Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   But I did find a hint of darkness; it was lurking in the life of
John F. Kennedy, conveyed in a poem written to him by Jacqueline
Kennedy, very prophetic as it turned out, shortly after their 1953
honeymoon in Mexico. It read in part: ``He would find love/He would
never find peace/For he must go seeking/The Golden Fleece.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no bird feeder for sale in the gift shop, but as I hit
the freeway, I was glad I had spent the afternoon in Yorba Linda,
which bills itself as the All-American Town. While President Nixon
was forever giving his Checkers speech down the hallway in another
part of the museum, ``My Dearest Partner'' proved that there has
been plenty of romance between presidents and their wives. To quote
Peaches and Herb, the First Couple of soul, ``Love is strange.''

&HT;        HISPANIC CAUCUS CONDEMNS DORNAN LEGAL REIMBURSEMENT,
PROMISES TO TRY TO BLOCK THE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- House Latinos attacked Republicans
Thursday for the decision to reimburse ex-Rep. Robert K. Dornan for
most of his legal fees incurred during the investigation into
alleged voter fraud in the 1996 election, saying Hispanic voters
``continue to be assaulted.''
</P>
<P>
   And they plan to try to block the decision. Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., plans to introduce a resolution this
(THURSDAY) evening that would block the funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to do what we can on the floor of the House today,''
said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the House
Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee decided to reimburse
part of the legal fees for both Dornan and Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
the Garden Grove Democrat who beat Dornan by 984 votes in November
of 1996. The committee gave Dornan $320,526 -- 69 percent of his
legal costs -- and Sanchez received $252,536 -- 61 percent of her
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this action an affront to the Orange County tax
payers,'' said Sanchez, who said the decision was merely an attempt
by Republicans to fund Dornan's campaign, as Dornan used campaign
funds to pay his lawyer fees. Sanchez payed her lawyers from a
legal defense fund separate from her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a partisan use of taxpayer funds for campaign
purposes,'' said Sanchez. ``This is a political contribution (by
Republicans) to one of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said the decision to reimburse Dornan
was one of a series of measures against Latinos, including a the
way the 2000 Census will be conducted -- which he said would keep
Latinos from being counted, and a pending bilingual education bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be assaulted by the majority party of the
House,'' said Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are in a state of denial -- they just cannot
accept that a Hispanic woman has won the seat,'' said Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-NY. ``They have found a new way to donate money to the
Bob Dornan campaign without following the rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, criticized the
Republicans on the House Oversight Committee for making its
decision without allowing input from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only should the Latino community be outraged by what has
taken place,'' said Roybal-Allard. ``It is a direct attack against
the democratic process that will affect every person in this
country.''

`SNAKE EYES': IN ATLANTIC CITY, LUCK IS CERTAINLY NO LADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's hot new thriller ``Snake Eyes'' is a great big
juicy gob of apocalyptic paranoia set in a garish Atlantic City
hotel and casino called the Millennium on the night a tropical
storm named Jezebel is bearing down on the New Jersey coast. The
storm, which is later upgraded into a hurricane, has swished in
just in time to jack up the excitement surrounding a heavyweight
championship boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's vertiginous opening sequence follows the mad dash of
the event's maniacal security chief, a local police detective, Rick
Santoro (Nicolas Cage), through the arena minutes before the
opening bell. Leaping down stairs, dancing through corridors,
barking salutations to one and all as though he were the world's
official greeter, this shark-grinning, bullying speed demon fields
calls from his girlfriend and his wife on his cell phone and places
a last-minute bet with his bookie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the night of nights for Rick, a petty king of sleaze who
dreams of one day becoming Atlantic City's mayor, and Cage squeezes
every last rancid drop of self-congratulatory ferocity out of his
character's glad-handing rampage. This pre-bout strut ends at
ringside where Rick joins forces with his best friend, Comdr. Kevin
Dunne (Gary Sinise), the ice-cool naval officer in charge of
security for the visiting secretary of defense (Joel Fabiani).
</P>
<P>
   As the fight begins, the camera, ignoring the boxers, anxiously
pans the flushed faces at ringside and notices two conspicuously
out-of-place patrons. One, wearing a cheap blond wig, awkwardly
plunks herself down beside the secretary of defense. A few seats
away sits a buxom, frizzy-haired red-haired woman who appears to be
without an escort. The fight has barely begun before the knockout
punch arrives out of the blue, and the ensuing pandemonium muffles
the sound of gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   But when the secretary of defense falls, mortally wounded, and
the woman in the blond wig flees, her arm grazed, her white dress
spattered with blood, panic sweeps through the arena, and 14,000
terrified patrons stampede toward the exits.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the director's most flamboyant fantasy of high-flying
conspiracy and corruption since ``Blow Out.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else in ``Snake Eyes'' matches the opening sequence
in adrenaline-pumping excitement, the movie never quite fizzles. It
just gets sillier and more exaggerated in the self-parodying ways
that De Palma's movies often do.
</P>
<P>
   As the preposterous plot of this cartoonish pop fable unwinds,
the championship bout turns out to have been rigged. It's all part
of a broader conspiracy involving an air defense system, a
cover-up, a whistle-blower and the schemes of a megalomaniacal
developer and industrialist (John Heard) who bears a distant
resemblance to Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   As the story rolls along, you can't help notice the flashy
accessories that are thrown in just for fun, like that buxom,
frizzy-haired redhead. De Palma has always preferred playing
ingenious technological games to developing characters and making
narrative sense, and ``Snake Eyes,'' which he conceived with the
screenwriter David Koepp, takes some entertainingly gimmicky
tangents.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which rarely ventures outside the hotel and resort
complex, replays the assassination from various perspectives,
including that of the prizefighters (in a boxing scene that looks
and sounds transparently fake). In another clever sequence, the
hotel's surveillance system becomes a critical tool in locating the
elusive room where a character is hiding from an assassin. During
this scene, the voyeuristic camera gratuitously becomes an overhead
Peeping Tom observing the goings-on in several adjacent hotel
suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes'' has deeper issues on its mind than cheap thrills,
conspiracy theories and the titillating joys of surveillance. In
its more dramatic scenes it becomes a hyperventilating inquiry into
the limits of friendship and loyalty and what constitutes
character.
</P>
<P>
   When Rick discovers to his astonishment and sorrow that Kevin is
a very different creature from the person he thought he knew, he
makes a screeching moral U-turn and suddenly becomes the
incorruptible guardian of truth, justice and the high road. Having
invited us to despise Rick, the movie asks us to take a deep breath
and swallow the notion that beneath his tarnish, he is really a
true-blue kind of guy with a rock-solid conscience that neither a
vicious beating nor a million-dollar bribe could begin to sway.
</P>
<P>
   From this turning point, Cage is so intent on winning back our
sympathy that his performance seems schizophrenic. As though
touched by a magic wand, this fire-breathing cell-phone-wielding
wheeler-dealer is suddenly an earnest, masochistic goody-goody
clawing his way through the pits of hell (now that Las Vegas has
turned into a family theme park resort, America's metaphorical hell
seems to have moved back East to Atlantic City) to uphold his
principles. Oh, please!

GEARING UP FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All summer, our children have stayed up late, slept until noon,
used the heat as an excuse to be couch potatoes planted in front of
the TV all afternoon, and eaten mostly what and when they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But, smack in the middle of this lazy, hot summer break, it's
suddenly time to start thinking again of back-to-school concerns.
Half the health tips and news releases I've gotten in the past week
seem to have a back-to-school theme. Among the better ones:
</P>
<P>
   TAMING THE WIDE-EYED MONSTER
</P>
<P>
   What's a parent to do with a child whose body clock isn't in
sync with alarm clocks, school bells and homework?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel Steinberg, vice president of medical affairs at
Children's Medical Center of Dallas, says we should start preparing
two weeks before the first day of school (it may already be too
late) to get our children back on schedule for fall classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start two weeks before the first day of school, and wake him
at the school wake-up time and expose him to natural light,''
Steinberg says. Getting a sleepy child up early and outside to play
is much better than forcing a nonsleepy child to go to bed early.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the child will begin to get sleepy earlier.
</P>
<P>
   PACKING HEALTHFUL LUNCHES
</P>
<P>
   To ensure children receive a nutritionally balanced diet,
parents should remember their ABCs, says Dr. Debby Demory-Luce of
the Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good guideline for packing nutrition into your child's
school lunch is to have a source of vitamin A, a source of the B
vitamins and a good source of both vitamin C and calcium because
many foods rich in these nutrients are also good sources of vitamin
D, iron, protein and carbohydrates,'' Demory-Luce says.
</P>
<P>
   For vitamin A, provide a half-cup serving of a deep yellow or
orange fruit or vegetable such as baby carrots (packed with a
favorite yogurt dip), cubed cantaloupe or dried apricots.
</P>
<P>
   B vitamins are found in whole grains, meat, nuts and seeds.
Meat, cheese or peanut butter sandwiches on whole- grain or
enriched breads, low-fat cheese with whole-wheat crackers, pasta
salad with cheese and kidney beans and treats like graham crackers,
oatmeal cookies studded with raisins and sunflower seeds are good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C and calcium are both found in calcium-fortified orange
juice. Or pack a half-cup of fresh strawberries, cubed pineapple,
citrus fruit or juice for vitamin C and a cup of low-fat milk,
yogurt or pudding for calcium.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTING AGAINST DISEASE
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the FDA approved CERTIVA, a new DPT vaccine with
the pertussis component modified to reduce the fever, redness,
pain, irritability and swelling sometimes associated with the
vaccine that protects children against whooping cough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fernando Guerra, public health director for the San Antonio
area, has been field-testing the vaccine for five years and says he
has seen better protection, fewer mild reactions and no seizures.

SUSPENSE THRILLER `SNAKE EYES' A SURE BET 
</HEADLINE>
 EYES-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Roll snake eyes and you've got nothing. House wins.
</P>
<P>
   That's the rule in gambling, but also in the games of big
business, crime and espionage, all of which rattle through the
first-rate thriller ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nicolas Cage is the on-screen star, ``Snake Eyes'' is
turned electric by the cinematic pyrotechnics of director Brian De
Palma, who takes the same zap with which he enlivened ``Mission:
Impossible'' and applies it to a more-intelligent suspense story.
</P>
<P>
   That story begins in a rush on the night of a heavyweight
championship fight in an Atlantic City casino, when one of the
ringside celebrities is assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness to the crime is Rick Santoro (Cage), a corrupt
Atlantic City cop who's also a savvy homicide detective.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro jumps into the investigation to help out his best
friend, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), a Navy commander in charge of
security for a high-ranking government official, who may become the
fall guy for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro and Dunne race to unravel a conspiratorial web before
they become the next victims of a plot that's bigger than both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   As they search for a mysterious woman (Julia Costello) who holds
the key to the assassination, she's on the run for her life while
trapped inside the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a smart, cynical script from David Koepp, director
De Palma twists this one, tense night of people trapped in
buildings and conspiracies into a zip of a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Koepp and De Palma have worked together before, on ``Mission:
Impossible'' and ``Carlito's Way.'' They clearly think along the
same devious lines, giving us plenty to ponder while we enjoy the
whirlwind action.
</P>
<P>
   As a visual virtuoso, De Palma is at the top of his cinematic
game with ``Snake Eyes,'' avoiding the wretched excesses that blew
up ``Carlito's Way'' and ``Raising Cain.''
</P>
<P>
   De Palma needs all his camera tricks because the story at heart
could have, in the hands of a lesser director, been ordinary. But
he shares with us the wizardry of a sly craftsman who's having as
much fun playing games as we are being played.
</P>
<P>
   He opens the movie at the championship fight with a long
tracking shot that rivals Robert Altman's playful opening to ``The
Player.'' Instead of the typical short cuts that most directors
use, De Palma keeps the camera and the action rolling through a
dizzying one-shot set-up that makes us feel like we're in the
casino and as giddy with excitement as Cage is.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-talking, cynical wise guy who suddenly finds himself
over-matched is a perfect role for Cage. He puts on display his
flashy humor and his intelligent desperation, all of which helps De
Palma build the sense that the more he reveals, the less we know.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's largest shortfall: De Palma reveals a little too
much a little too quickly. He seems to doubt that we can follow the
intricacies of the mystery, so he spells them out before he needs
to, relying thereafter upon his showmanship, which is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes'' is easily the best suspense film of the summer,
much smarter and more exciting than ``The Negotiator, ``A Perfect
Murder'' or ``The X Files.'' It's in a class with Kevin Costner's
``No Way Out'' and ``Nick of Time.'' Go see it before you know
</P>
<P>
   too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes'' is rated R for violence and profanity. 4 stars.  &QL;

PENN &AMP; TELLER: NOT PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK, AND PROUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Penn &AMP; Teller aren't reverent about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Their stage magic show is a full-frontal deconstruction of every
hoary cliche the ancient art has produced. In it, they gleefully
lampoon all kinds of truths commonly held to be sacred.
</P>
<P>
   A Penn &AMP; Teller performance isn't a good choice for a church
outing.
</P>
<P>
   So, who would expect them to be reverent about plate-spinners
and odd puppet acts? The duo's new series on the FX cable network
presents pop music acts side-by-side with top-notch practitioners
of the variety arts, all on one Las Vegas stage. Plus showgirls, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Penn &AMP; Teller also do tricks, but their skewed outlook fits the
format.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central does a Vegas-based revue show, ``Viva Variety,''
which airs Tuesday nights. Where Comedy Central aims for a campy
sendup of variety shtick _ its hosts sport fake Eurotrash accents _
Penn &AMP; Teller are going for something a little more, well,
reverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letterman and other shows have had really good variety acts,
but never with respect,'' said Penn Jillette, who, with his usually
silent partner, met recently with TV critics to promote the show:
``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City Spectacular,`` airing Monday on FX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a little embarrassed when there was an act on
television that requires a great deal of skill but is a little
goofy, and the host comes over and acts like the person doing this
skill is some sort of fool for having learned to do something
that's very, very difficult. I started out as a juggler, so I know
what it means to spend eight hours a day, seven days a week
practicing something that people just dismiss with a wave of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought a lot about what it means to be Lou Reed and a
rock-and-roll legend, but we haven't thought very much about how
much it takes to sit in a room with animals that have brains the
size of a walnut and enough RAM to run a 1987 laptop and actually
train those animals to work on voice commands in Russian _ without
killing them. And we wanted to point that out to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, our idea was to do some of our stuff and put it in the
context of a variety show.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, said Jillette, will be ``that what a guy who trains
house cats does for a living and what Bob Dylan does for a living
and what Johann Sebastian Bach did for a living are exactly and
precisely the same thing. And there hasn't been a show since Ed
Sullivan that has really stated that in no uncertain terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before channel-surfing, Sullivan was able to hold
the home audience's attention by presenting a parade of unrelated
acts. Sometimes Sullivan's bookings seemed calculated to vex fans
who were dialing in for one particular performer or pop group, but
he ruled television for a long, long time with a format that Penn &AMP;
Teller are now attempting to reinvigorate.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional TV wisdom says that the clicker has become our
Sullivan surrogate, that the embarrassment of niches available on
cable TV has become every viewer's own endless variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Teller, who can, in fact, talk, said he and Jillette hope to
reclaim Clicker Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ideal would be that you would get the same sensation from
watching our show as you do from hitting the remote control button
_ that you're popping into entirely different worlds, one after the
other, but without the effort of pressing that little thing with
your thumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laziness,'' added his tall partner, ``is our friend.'' &QL;

A LITERARY TOUR OF THE BERKSHIRES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ In the fall of 1899, a young woman of old New
York society and fledgling literary notice grew disgusted with what
she considered the vapid wasteland of Newport, R.I., the family
resort that both defined and imprisoned her. On an impulse, she
packed up her dogs, her servants and her husband and headed for
Lenox, Mass., the fashionable Berkshire mountain retreat where
there were plenty of millionaire ``cottagers,'' too, but where
Nathaniel Hawthorne had completed ``The House of Seven Gables'' and
Herman Melville had written ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, the young woman, Edith Wharton, had built
the Mount, a classical American home of painted white stucco and
green shutters, modeled on a grand 17th-century English country
house. There, she wrote ``The House of Mirth,'' entertained Henry
James and lived through the ugly end of her marriage. Today the
Mount, under scaffolding and with peeling paint, is as much a
reflection of the Wharton psyche as her tragic heroine, Lily Bart.
</P>
<P>
   My family and I spent a recent weekend touring the Mount and
wandering around other literary landmarks of the Berkshires. We
went to Melville's Arrowhead farm in Pittsfield, then to
Hawthorne's reconstructed ``little red house'' behind Tanglewood
and finally to William Cullen Bryant's family homestead in
Cummington. The tour guides ranged from superb to dotty to
nonexistent, but every house except Hawthorne's was worth the trip.
The weekend turned out to be a journey into a past when writers
sought inspiration from the quiet hills for their turbulent ideas.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, we also soaked up Shakespeare, modern dance and
Mozart, small samplings of the local offerings that weekend. In
summer, the Berkshires are such a banquet of culture that when I
jogged through Tanglewood on Saturday morning, I was serenaded by
violins playing at breakfast on the outrageously green lawn. As
Wharton herself once wrote, ``The truth is, I am in love with the
place _ climate, scenery, life &AMP; all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenox is an easy three-hour drive up the Taconic Parkway from
New York City, with meandering country roads to perk up the last
leg. Early on Friday evening my husband and I and our two children,
ages 8 and 4, checked into the Apple Tree Inn, a big white frame
house with a friendly staff and a rose-bordered pool overlooking
the hills. Then we picked up picnic supplies and headed to the
Mount, five minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the dusk on Wharton's front lawn, near the remains of
her French flower garden, we spread out a tablecloth, ate cold
barbecued chicken and slapped at mosquitoes. Picnics are very much
allowed _ the grounds are open from May through October _ but there
was not a soul around and the silence made me feel sacrilegious. I
imagined the author of ``The Age of Innocence'' and ``Ethan Frome''
coming out on her terrace and ordering a servant to remove us.
Wharton was always a terrific snob.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we walked to Wharton's old stable for a likable
production of ``All's Well That Ends Well'' put on by Shakespeare
and Company, the theater group that makes its home at the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   We returned the next morning for an hourlong group tour of the
house, led by a well-informed and sardonic Kathleen Forrest, 21, a
history major at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. When
Ms. Forrest took us into the Mount's Italian-inspired gallery, she
pointed out the terrazzo floor that Wharton had installed, then
remarked: ``She said it would keep the room cool and easier to
clean. I'm not quite sure how she knew that because she never
cleaned a floor in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mount naturally had abundant staff and was largely run by
Teddy Wharton, Edith's husband, freeing her to write in the
mornings. Ms. Forrest told us that Wharton awakened at 6 a.m.,
wrote in longhand while still in bed, then let her pages fall to
the floor to be collected later by the maid.
</P>
<P>
   Biographers describe a woman who largely hid the arduous work of
her writing, a profession unsuitable for a woman of her class and
time, from her constant house guests. The Wharton biographer Percy
Lubbock describes how ``a gay little note, thrown off as it were
between chapters, would appear for the guest on his breakfast tray,
with a greeting and plan for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m., Wharton surfaced to play hostess, overseeing walks,
carriage rides, motor trips into the countryside and amusing
dinners. Henry James wrote to Wharton's sister-in-law from the
Mount that ``I need scarcely tell you that I am very happy here,
surrounded by every loveliness of nature and every luxury of art
and treated with a benevolence that brings tears to my eyes.'' Like
Wharton, James reveled in a country house that rejected the
Victorian clutter of the era for light, simplicity and common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wharton, who is considered to have had nearly
professional competence in architectural design, had strong
opinions on interior decoration and was co-author, with the
architect Ogden Codman Jr., of an arch and witty book on how to
outfit an upper-class home. Published in 1897, the book, ``The
Decoration of Houses,'' mounts a full-scale attack on the heavy
swags and gewgaws of the homes of Wharton's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``House decoration has come to be regarded as a black art by
those who have seen their rooms subjected to the manipulations of
the modern upholsterer,'' it says, adding that the average American
drawing room was so uncomfortable that ``no one will ever sit in it
except the luckless visitor who has no other refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The book says a visitor should at least be entitled to the
solace of a few books, ``but as all the tables in the room are
littered with knickknacks, it is difficult for the most
philanthropic hostess to provide even this slight alleviation.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the rooms of the Mount are large but still
comfortable and intimate, with much air and natural light. French
doors open onto a sunny Italianate terrace from four rooms on the
main floor. The most interesting is Wharton's oak-paneled library _
women of the era were not supposed to have libraries _ which looks
like an elegant men's club. Unfortunately, neither Wharton's books
nor her library desk, a large table called a bureau-ministre much
recommended in ``The Decoration of Houses,'' are in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Wharton's smaller study adjoins the library, and as Ms.
Forrest took us through, she described Edith's love affair with the
bisexual Morton Fullerton _ ``It didn't end all that well'' _ as
well as Teddy's apparent manic-depression, followed by his
embezzlement of Edith's trust fund to buy a house for his mistress.
The couple parted ways, and in 1911 Edith sold the Mount and moved
to France. She never lived in the United States again.
</P>
<P>
   Today the house is in disrepair, the result of a court fight
between Edith Wharton Restoration, the nonprofit group that owns
the house and grounds, and Shakespeare and Company, the tenant that
performs plays on the property. In the mid-1990s, Edith Wharton
Restoration tried to evict the acting group, saying it had damaged
the property, but last spring reached an agreement that the
troupe's lease will expire in 2003.

</P>
<P>
   Edith Wharton Restoration is now trying to raise $15 million to
preserve the house, and Ms. Forrest ended her tour with an appeal
for money. Last month Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the Mount as
part of a tour of historic sites to encourage donations for
American landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   A restoration would surely be magnificent. But I liked the
decrepit state of the house. It seemed honest, like a real house
abandoned by its owner. At the least we were allowed complete
freedom to wander the grounds, something unthinkable should the
Mount become an exquisite museum. At the same time, I imagined
Wharton's horror at seeing the state of her beloved retreat.
Throughout her life she kept her homes as artfully as she
structured her sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was 10 minutes away, at Arrowhead, the claustrophobic
farmhouse where Melville wrote ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Three guides took us through two rooms each. The first woman was
confused and the second rude. (``Sir, I don't like to be bossy, but
we ask people not to touch anything,'' she snapped when a hapless
soul in our group got too close to a bookcase.) But the third,
Janet Cook, 74, was a great enthusiast. Melville, she told us, was
such a literary star when he married that he had to change the
location of his wedding to escape the groupies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you like them apples?'' she asked us, thrilled. ``He
was the first literary sex symbol!''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the tour was the small upstairs study where
Melville wrote ``Moby-Dick.'' Looking out the window, we could see
his view of the two humps of Mount Greylock that even in summer
suggest a huge whale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook told us that Melville often locked himself in to write,
that his was not a happy family, and that he had an intense
friendship with Hawthorne. ``When they met, something unusual
happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not go so far as to say that Melville was in love with
Hawthorne, as some scholars believe. Nor did she introduce any
debate about whether Melville beat his wife, as an Ohio State
University Melvillean announced in 1994. Ms. Cook's tone was
respectful, even awed. I think Melville would have liked her tour.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped briefly at a replica of the house where Hawthorne
lived from the spring of 1850 to the fall of 1851, now a
fund-raising headquarters for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Inside
is a modern office, nothing more, and no sense at all of the
writer.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, we drove to the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in
Becket for a spectacular performance by Ballet Hispanico, an Upper
West Side-based company that fuses Hispanic culture and
contemporary American dance.
</P>
<P>
   We spent Sunday afternoon on the grass at Tanglewood, listening
to the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. The grounds are a Garden of
Eden. Even the forest-green garbage bins are tasteful, with sides
so high that nothing as unpleasant as an ice cream wrapper mars the
esthetic. People up close listened intently to Wagner's ``Siegfried
Idyll'' and Mozart's Serenade in G for strings. Further back they
read the newspaper and napped. Everyone was well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Last stop was Cummington, 40 minutes away, for a look at the
home of Bryant, the poet and influential Abolitionist editor of The
New York Evening Post. We were too late for the 1 to 5 p.m. tour,
and the pretty, cream-colored farmhouse with light brown trim was
closed. But the trip was well worth it for the peaceful views from
the front porch overlooking the hills, and the two rows of graceful
old sugar maples, planted by Bryant and his brothers a century and
a half ago, lining the drive.
</P>
<P>
   We had a picnic dinner at a swimming hole in Windsor State
Forest just down the road, then took a fast look at Windsor Jambs,
a waterfall that was a big hit with the children.
</P>
<P>
   For me the biggest hit of the weekend was the Mount. On the way
back home, I pored over the 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography
of Wharton by R.W.B. Lewis to find descriptions of the home and
what it meant to its mistress. The best thing I found was an
excerpt from ``The Fullness of Life,'' a short story Wharton wrote
in 1891 about the emotional and sexual limitations of her marriage:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sometimes thought that a woman's nature is like a great
house full of rooms: there is the hall, through which everyone
passes in going in and out; the drawing room, where one receives
formal visits; the sitting room, where the members of the family
come and go as they list; but beyond that, far beyond, are other
rooms, the handles of whose doors perhaps are never turned; no one
knows the way to them, no one knows whither they lead; and in the
innermost room, the holy of holies, the soul sits alone and waits
for a footstep that never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though I'm sure Wharton wouldn't like all the tourists tramping
through the Mount, looking for clues to her nature, I think I found
some. The house was, after all, a creation of her imagination, just
like her writing. And it reveals an outwardly conservative woman of
money, discernment and social position whose Berkshire escape gave
her room to pour her rebellion into her writing.

 &HT;      HISPANIC CAUCUS CONDEMNS DORNAN LEGAL REIMBURSEMENT, PROMISES
TO TRY TO BLOCK THE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- House Latinos attacked Republicans
Thursday for the decision to reimburse ex-Rep. Robert K. Dornan for
most of his legal fees incurred during the investigation into
alleged voter fraud in the 1996 election, saying Hispanic voters
``continue to be assaulted.''
</P>
<P>
   And they plan to try to block the decision. Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., plans to introduce a resolution this
(THURSDAY) evening that would block the funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to do what we can on the floor of the House today,''
said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the House
Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee decided to reimburse
part of the legal fees for both Dornan and Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
the Garden Grove Democrat who beat Dornan by 984 votes in November
of 1996. The committee gave Dornan $320,526 -- 69 percent of his
legal costs -- and Sanchez received $252,536 -- 61 percent of her
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this action an affront to the Orange County tax
payers,'' said Sanchez, who said the decision was merely an attempt
by Republicans to fund Dornan's campaign, as Dornan used campaign
funds to pay his lawyer fees. Sanchez payed her lawyers from a
legal defense fund separate from her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a partisan use of taxpayer funds for campaign
purposes,'' said Sanchez. ``This is a political contribution (by
Republicans) to one of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said the decision to reimburse Dornan
was one of a series of measures against Latinos, including a the
way the 2000 Census will be conducted -- which he said would keep
Latinos from being counted, and a pending bilingual education bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be assaulted by the majority party of the
House,'' said Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are in a state of denial -- they just cannot
accept that a Hispanic woman has won the seat,'' said Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-NY. ``They have found a new way to donate money to the
Bob Dornan campaign without following the rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, criticized the
Republicans on the House Oversight Committee for making its
decision without allowing input from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only should the Latino community be outraged by what has
taken place,'' said Roybal-Allard. ``It is a direct attack against
the democratic process that will affect every person in this
country.''

   Some Government officials are now calling for a different
approach that initially plays down vaccines in favor of
antibiotics. Others defend vaccines, but concede that getting them
quickly is nearly impossible, given industry's production limits
and the need to insure vaccine safety and effectiveness. Still
others fault vaccines as offering little or no protection against
such deadly threats as smallpox and anthrax, seen as likely weapons
in germ attacks. A review of events leading to the Clinton vaccine
decision reveals that the proposal was pushed by a small group of
scientists, businessmen and policy makers who largely shared the
same views as they struggled to confront a complex new threat.
Working in Washington's frenetic, often insular world, they tended
to overwhelm or sidestep doubters, and failed to see warning signs.

TAKE A GOOD LOOK BEFORE CONVERTING REGULAR IRA TO A ROTH IRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We retired this May, earning enough to qualify for IRA
contributions this year, but not so much as to affect our ability
to collect full Social Security payments. Our tax man suggested
that since this is the last year that we will be able to purchase
an IRA that we establish a Roth IRA for this year and also transfer
our exiting IRAs to Roth accounts. We know very little of this, and
don't understand most of what we've read, except that we would have
to pay taxes on our old IRAs if we transferred them to Roths. Each
IRA is about $50,000 and they are in bank CDs. Would a transfer be
advisable at our ages _ 62 and 64? We will be in the 28 percent
bracket for this year, and in 1999 we will have Social Security, a
small pension, and interest earned _ which we hope will mean we
will go down to the 15 percent tax bracket. Which way should we go?
</P>
<P>
   F.W., Orion, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With all respect to your tax adviser, I can see nothing to
gain either by establishing Roth IRAs for this year or converting
the traditional IRAs to Roth accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's do the math. If you were to convert the traditional IRAs
to Roths, you would be allowed to spread the tax obligation over
the course of four tax years. This would mean that $25,000 would be
added to your income in each of the next four years. This year that
$25,000 would be taxed at the 28 percent rate _ unless the amount
is sufficient to push you into a still higher bracket. In the next
three years, the same amount would be added to your income, and
again would probably be enough to drive you to a higher tax
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   In the alternative, if you retain the accounts as traditional
IRAs, you will have a little more control over your tax destiny.
For example, you might look at your tax situation each year,
determine how much money you might be able to withdraw from the
IRAs without taking you beyond the 15 percent tax bracket, and
simply withdraw that amount. With luck, over the long haul, most of
the money eventually would be taxed at only 15 percent, rather than
at the higher rates that you would pay through with a transfer to a
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule of thumb for a transfer to a Roth is that it is
inadvisable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when the
money is withdrawn than when the proposed transfer would occur.
Some people, and especially people who are a lot younger than you
are, might decide that they want to make a transfer because they
feel tax rates in general are likely to be higher in their later
years. And finally, some might make the transfer without regard to
the tax rates, but rather because they want to escape the schedule
of mandatory minimum annual withdrawals from traditional IRAs which
begin after the owner reaches age 70 1/2. Unless you fall into this
last category, I see nothing for you to gain by transferring to a
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, I see no reason you would profit by putting
your 1998 IRA contributions into Roth accounts. Since you're in the
28 percent tax bracket, you would cut your tax bill by $1,120 with
a traditional IRA. Compare that with the prospect of withdrawals at
the 15 percent, which might be made as early as 1999, and which
would bring a $600 tax bill if you are in a 15 percent tax bracket.
Yes, the growth of the account would also be taxed if you used the
traditional IRA, but especially when you are using CDs as the
vehicle for your IRA savings, the growth is not likely to be enough
to offset the difference between a 15 percent and a 28 percent tax
rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am as spooked about the market as you are. My wife and I
have IRAs with Vanguard. My total is about $803,000, of which
$603,000 is in the Vanguard GNMA fund, $20,000 in its Specialized
Gold and Precious Metals fund, $131,000 in a brokerage account, and
the rest in Vanguard Prime Money Market fund. My wife's $63,000
account is entirely in Vanguard GNMA. I am 66 and retired, and my
wife is 60. Am I too conservative?
</P>
<P>
   I also have IRAs with Janus, consisting of $96,000 in money
markets, $31,000 in Janus Worldwide and $3,000 in Janus Twenty. I
am thinking of moving $4,000 a month from the Janus money market
fund to Worldwide for four or five years as a dollar cost-averaging
approach. Should I do the same with Vanguard, moving funds from the
money market account into Vanguard Index Value fund?
</P>
<P>
   E.O., Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd say you're a good deal more spooked with our stock market
than I am. Your brokerage portfolio is heavily dominated by foreign
stocks; between that portfolio, the 25 percent of Janus Worldwide
that's in U.S. equities, and the small position in Janus 20, I
calculate just 2.7 percent of the total portfolio in domestic
stocks. (This calculation does not include the Vanguard Specialized
Gold and Precious Metals holding, which is about 20 to 25 percent
invested in US companies, but not necessarily US companies with
most of their operations here.)
</P>
<P>
   Are you too conservative? Yes, and you're too sour on the US
markets as well. While I agree that they're overvalued right now,
at age 66 you're simply too young to throw in the towel on the
world's strongest economy. I think a dollar cost-averaging program
moving the Vanguard money market account into Index Value is a good
idea _ a program of moving $1,100 a month into Index Value would
complete the investment within 49 months, presuming 5 percent
average returns from the money market.
</P>
<P>
   As for the more substantial amount of money in the Janus money
market fund, I agree that it should be moved to the equity side,
but I think you have enough overseas holdings already. I'd rather
see a dollar-cost-averaging program with tried-and-tested Janus
fund as the target for about 75 percent of this money, and with
Vanguard Specialized Health Care as the target for the balance.
(Incidentally, you have miscalculated in determining that a
sequence of $4,000 monthly withdrawals from the Janus Money Market
account would spread your investment over four or five years; it
would take only a little more than 25 months. A 48-month program
would entail moving about $2,200 a month, while a 60-month program
would require $1,800 monthly purchase of the stock funds; both of
these calculations again assume 5 percent money market returns.)
</P>
<P>
   Where would all of this take us? Currently the total equity
portion of the portfolio is 18.6 percent of the portfolio. If all
of the transfers discussed were completed at once (rather than
spread out over several years) the new portfolio would be 33.1
percent equities, and 17.3 percent of it would be in US equities.
Given the vagaries of the markets, it is of course impossible to
estimate what the actual percentages might be by the time the
investments are completed. But in any event, none of these moves
would affect the bedrock of your combined portfolios _ the
$666,763, or 66.9 percent of the total, in Vanguard GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   Are all of these suggestions too rich for your blood? Well, if
so, what about a compromise? You might doctor the formula by
building the equity side to 25 percent of the total portfolio,
which would entail moving only $64,184 of the money market accounts
into stock funds. Again, if you made this move I would go entirely
into US equity funds with this money. That would leave $130,658 in
the money markets. At this point you certainly have plenty of the
Vanguard GNMA fund, and I suggest that if you take this course the
$130,658 be evenly divided between Vanguard Short-Term Bond fund
and Vanguard Corporate High-Yield Bond fund.

`HAPPY ALCHEMY': AT THE THEATER WITH A COMPULSIVE COMPANION 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No offense to Canada, but in a way it's too bad that Robertson
Davies did not live in a country of more, shall we say,
geopolitical import. Davies, a novelist, playwright, newspaperman,
commentator and critic who died in 1995, was a keen observer,
defender and interpreter of all things Canadian, and to say that
his status in that vast, sparsely populated nation was as a kind of
free-thinking Shavian figure is to reflect on both the breadth and
vitality of his intellect and, perhaps, the all-too-limited
boundaries of his influence, at least insofar as affairs of the day
were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   His range of interests extended far beyond the borders of
Ontario or Manitoba, of course, as is ably demonstrated in ``Happy
Alchemy,'' a posthumous collection of essays, plays, speeches and
librettos edited by his widow, Brenda Davies, and their daughter
Jennifer Surridge. Aptly subtitled ``On the Pleasures of Music and
the Theater,'' the anthology narrows Davies' focus to two of his
lifelong passions, opera and drama.
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means intended to narrow our view of Davies,
celebrated author of ``Leaven of Malice,'' ``The Manticore'' and
``What's Bred in the Bone.'' If anything, the book in thoroughly
entertaining fashion acquaints us with Davies' expansive erudition
and gift for rendering literary and historical complexities in
simple, human terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks, Shakespeare, Mozart, Verdi, Shaw: they all
enthralled Davies, an inveterate theatergoer who grew a bit
compulsive about his habit. In 1957, his editors report, he began
augmenting the diaries he kept for much of his life with notices he
wrote up for every play and opera he saw. And though he was to
teach drama at the University of Toronto for 20 years, he seemed to
relish the idea of himself as an enthusiast rather than an expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may prove that I was not a good playwright,'' he wrote, in
an excerpt from the first page of the musings he called his Theater
Notes, ``but I sincerely believe that I have been a good PLAYGOER,
and that is something better, perhaps, than having been a
well-known critic. Critics often do not like the theater; I have
never liked anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   The purity of his passion is apparent in the assortment of short
takes that make up ``Happy Alchemy''; it becomes clear, as you
absorb his arguments on the nature of evil in ``Macbeth,'' or why
the genre of melodrama has been unfairly maligned, or how Lewis
Carroll's obsession with little girls, so suspect to the
contemporary skeptic, could have remained chaste, that Davies is
the ideal theater buddy, a generous audience member with a
classicist's appreciation of form.
</P>
<P>
   If he seems a little impatient at times with the liberties of
modernism, you chalk it up to his wide experience of more
traditional kinds of theater (although, interestingly, he rails
against realism on the stage). He was not anything close to an old
fogey about the theater or opera. He was simply a playgoer who knew
a little about virtually everything, and in some specific areas of
inquiry quite a bit more than that.
</P>
<P>
   There's something donnish in his ruminations, and the 33 entries
in the collection represent the marginalia of a life in academia
and letters: the texts of addresses to gatherings of scholars and
theater lovers, introductions to literary anthologies, Waugh-like
bits of satire. The author's devoted wife and daughter include
Davies' comments on audience reaction to his speeches, which he
always found to be (surprise!) very good indeed. (The ego was
robust.)
</P>
<P>
   A few of the pieces might have remained in the family scrapbook
_ Davies' appreciation of Laurence Olivier for Maclean's magazine,
for instance, is disappointingly generic _ but by and large ``Happy
Alchemy'' serves up his ideas on topics serious and serendipitous
as a refreshing medley.
</P>
<P>
   The best selections in this book explore subjects that might, in
ordinary circumstances, cause eyelids to droop. These are instances
in which the author consistently overturns expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noble Greeks'' is a marvelously readable discourse,
delivered at the Stratford Festival in Ontario in 1993 before a
performance of ``The Bacchae,'' on the Greek god Dionysus and the
Dionysian impulses at large in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melodrama: The Silver King,'' delivered at the Shaw Festival
in Ontario the same year, is a persuasive, courageously
unself-conscious defense of an unfashionable art form. ``It appeals
not simply to the intellect,'' he writes, ``but to the heart, and
even in our own seemingly harsh days audiences still have hearts to
be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparate elements of ``Happy Alchemy'' may have been put to
paper at disparate moments, but there is a linkage here, in the
unifying tone of Davies' fancies. The longing of a sensitive,
reflective spirit for a more soulful age is detectable again and
again in these essays; you sense in his documentation of his
theatergoing a touching desire to hold on to the visceral thrill of
the instant when the curtain rises. Of traffic stopping suddenly
for a scholar in Oxford, he writes in ``Lewis Carroll in the
Theater'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be one of the few places left in the world where
self-assertion, covetousness, and the whole world of the combustion
engine must come to a halt because somebody distinguished for his
intelligence is going about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man aghast at the antediluvian spectacle of the modern
world.
</P>
<P>
   His desire for communion extends to outsiders' appreciation of
the country of his birth. There is little of the oft-expressed
writer's alienation from his homeland in these pages. Indeed,
``Happy Alchemy'' brims with a Canadian's idealism for the people
with whom he grew up and wrote about almost as much as it seeks to
celebrate art.
</P>
<P>
   When, in the late 1940s, a friend proposed to write a play about
Canada, Davies recalls in one of his essays, he had his doubts:
``It was risky because Canada has for a long time been thought a
dull country, with dull people. But there was a time when Norway
was thought dull, and Ireland was thought absurd, yet both of them
brought forth plays which have been acclaimed as treasures by
theaters around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Happy Alchemy'' attests, Canada's own literary reputation
got an immeasurable boost with the addition of Davies to the
library.

`UNMADE BEDS': STORIES OF 4 REAL PEOPLE, WITH A HANDFUL OF LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brenda isn't really looking for love; she just needs a man to
pay off the $2,700 in mortgage payments she owes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is looking for the right woman but thinks he'll never
find her because he's 5 feet 4 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey considers himself ``a catch'' at age 54 (because he's
HIV-negative, he says). He takes pride in never having dated ``a
mutt'' but doesn't seem to be having much luck with the purebreds.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee sometimes feels her situation is hopeless because she's
``28 and not married _ it's absurd.'' She weighs 225 pounds and has
no plans to try to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   These four single New Yorkers are real people who were filmed by
Nicholas Barker, a British television and radio producer, for a
little more than six months in 1996-97. Their stories and feelings,
which they express directly to the camera, constitute ``Unmade
Beds,'' Barker's fascinating, depressing and undeniably cruel new
film.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee comes off as the most sympathetic character. One minute
she's in a taxi with a Lord &AMP; Taylor shopping bag and a cell phone,
laughing with a friend about a bad date: ``He looked exactly like
Humpty Dumpty. And he was as old as my father.'' The next, it
seems, she has tears in her eyes, saying: ``I am so pathetic. I
just feel like there's no hope.'' In one scene she calls an old
boyfriend and a woman answers. She tells her best friend that she
won't try a dating service because if that, the last resort, didn't
work, what would she do next?
</P>
<P>
   Mikey comes off as the most unlikable. In his opening lines,
toned down for print, he welcomes the filmmakers to his home by
saying that his apartment is for women to have sex in. If they
don't want to have sex, he adds, they shouldn't visit. He complains
about having spent $197 for dinner on a failed date but is seen in
another scene taking a date to a deli near the Milford Plaza Hotel.
He describes his mother as ``the best person I ever met in my whole
life.'' You do have to feel for him, though, when the junior
cashier at the Angelika movie theater automatically gives him a
senior discount.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda, a woman of a certain (and unspecified) age, is the most
entertaining. Standing in her apartment in a bra, denim shorts and
hot rollers, she explains that she's not attracted to Jewish men.
There is one exception, however: Tony Curtis. ``I would sleep with
him now,'' she says, ``just for how sexy he USED to be.'' She has a
peculiar kind of honesty, considering shoplifting of small items a
right, stepping out of the shower to demonstrate her baby-oil
beauty treatment and pointing out the place in her bra where, she
says, she keeps her drugs. Brenda is the only character in the film
who gets what she wants by the end.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 40, seems saddest. ``Why do these women hang out with
effeminate homosexual men? How do you expect to meet guys?'' he
asks, adding two gruff words of advice to those absent women:
``Grow up.'' Admitting to a fear of dying alone, he decides to go
to a dating coach and to work at trying ``not to be so intense.''
It seems completely appropriate that he has an Edward Hopper print
over his kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The camera takes a long look at the Hopper, as well as at a
dripping bathroom faucet. The artistic intent must be to make them
symbols of despair. But if so, why does the camera give us a
lingering close-up of Aimee's Balducci's bag, with a baguette and a
pineapple sticking out?

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ This is not the Soviet Union. But the man who
controls this small nation wedged between Poland and Russia is
doing his best to reproduce the original.
</P>
<P>
   The autocratic president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has
jailed opponents, muted the free press and propped up a
languishing, state-run economy, even as the emerging markets of
Eastern European neighbors blossom around him.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he revived the Cold War on a diplomatic scale in
Minsk, the country's capital. Lukashenko provoked a dispute with
the United States and other Western governments by dislodging
ambassadors from their residences.
</P>
<P>
   The episode prompted a further chill over already cool
diplomatic relations with America (See related story).
</P>
<P>
   But for Lukashenko, who turns 44 this month, such controversy
only fuels a political career propelled by the nostalgia among his
people for Soviet glory. It has made Belarus the most Soviet-like
of the 15 independent countries created when the Soviet Union
dissolved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A former collective farm director who speaks plainly and acts
forcefully, Lukashenko has cultivated an image as champion of the
Slavic world, loath to grovel for Western aid or world acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   He is a maverick with a mouth, who appeals to the simple farmers
and factory workers of Belarus. He has spoken with admiration of
Joseph Stalin. He has warned his people of the dangers of NATO
expansion to their borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent example of Soviet-speak, he went on
television to urge the population to amass in August to assist in
harvesting crops, saying ``it is necessary to have bread'' to
defend the country. ``We are being perpetually kicked everywhere;
everybody is trying to suppress Belarus,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not a majority, of Belarus's 10 million people support
the man they freely elected in 1994, and share his dreams for the
economic security and global stature of the Soviet years.
</P>
<P>
   It is a phenomenon viewed with alarm by Western diplomats and
international human rights advocates, who fear that the tail could
end up wagging the dog -- that the Soviet-style revival in tiny
Belarus could infiltrate problem-plagued Russia, which is
struggling with democratic and market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko advocates a political reunion with Moscow and, say
friends and foes alike, harbors one over-arching ambition: to rule
a neo-Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong desire for power,'' said Pavel Daneiko, an
economist and political analyst in Minsk. ``That dream, that idea,
pushes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has made frequent campaign-style trips to Russia's
provinces and hosted local Russian politicians in Minsk, cementing
political ties while circumventing the power structure in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the belief that Lukashenko is angling for a seat in the
Kremlin ignores a host of political and logistical obstacles, not
the least of which are a number of strong Russian contenders who
want to replace Boris Yeltsin. And there is the question of how
Lukashenko, as the leader of a separate state, would circumvent the
Russian constitution to add his name to the ballot there.
</P>
<P>
   In Belarus, Lukashenko emerged in 1993 as head of a government
anti-corruption commission and used it as a launching pad to the
presidency, winning 85 percent of the votes in the July 1994
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he pushed a referendum that extended his
six-year term an additional two years, to 2001, and gave him
sweeping controls over the parliament (which he dissolved) and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   He also began a crackdown against opposition leaders, stifled
newspapers and closed a popular FM radio station which broadcast
reports from western news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have access to information. And if they don't
have access to information, they cannot make informed decisions,''
complained Zhanna Litvina, president of the Belarus Association of
Journalists and former director of the FM station.
</P>
<P>
   He set about restoring and preserving the symbols of the past:
wheat sheaves, hammers and sickles, statues and busts of Lenin and
other icons of the Communist era. Soviet-era textbooks have been
reintroduced in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Belarus retains the heavy and soul-less architecture
of the Soviet era and a sputtering economy beset by massive
inflation, the capital offers signs of liberties despite the
efforts of the president.
</P>
<P>
   On a balmy midsummer evening, the young and stylish set dine at
sidewalk cafes, mobile telephones at the ready. McDonald's sells
its burgers here. A Ford Motor Co. plant on the edge of the city
cranks out the pride of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And while many Lukashenko opponents have been jailed, many
others walk freely and speak openly.
</P>
<P>
   But what worries human rights activists and western diplomats is
a steady erosion of freedoms in the four years since Lukashenko was
elected. ``People here call it slamming the door slowly,''' said
one American aid worker.
</P>
<P>
   The long list of abuses has been catalogued by human rights
groups -- the jailing and beating of political opponents, arrest
and harassment of independent local journalists and a near-monopoly
on information by state-run newspapers, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a decade that has seen the emergence of eastern Europe from
Soviet repression, Belarus is turning back the clock,'' said Holly
Cartner of New York-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Given its blank history, perhaps it is not surprising that
Lukashenko has been able to mold Belarus to fit his fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief period following World War I, Belarus has
never before existed as a sovereign state. For centuries, the
territory, about the size of Kansas, was a battleground and
possession for warring Russia, Germany and other imperial European
powers, and then a province of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   If Lukashenko wishes to build an empire of his own, opponents
say his time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   The centralized state economy has withered in recent years
despite official figures showing 10 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The local currency, the ruble, has taken a beating so far this
year and inflation has soared to an annual rate of more than 120
percent by some estimates. In March, Lukashenko ordered prices not
to rise more than 2 percent a month. Pensioners and workers get
paid on time -- in contrast to Russia, where massive wage arrears
have prompted Yeltsin's popularity to plummet -- but their currency
buys less. The average monthly wages equals only about $60.
</P>
<P>
   ``He satisfies their needs by printing more money. The policy is
destructive and it doesn't allow us to attract any new investment.
We are approaching the collapse of the economy,'' said Yuri
Khadyka, vice chairman of the Belarus Popular Front, a leading
opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   But Daneiko, the economist, asserts that time is still on
Lukashenko's side. He can sustain the economy from the goodwill of
Russia, Belarus' main trading partner and with whom it has joined
in an economic union, and avoid begging for Western aid, and the
ties that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the president can decide that things will change,'' said
Danieko. ``And for him, the one main goal is that nothing will
change.''

   Government: Alexander Lukashenko became the first democratically
elected president in 1994, but pushed a 1996 referendum giving him
broad, dictator-like powers over parliament and the courts. He has
been condemned by Western nations, including the United States, for
human rights abuses and curbs on personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Economy: Main exports are machinery, agricultural produce,
chemicals; less than 5 percent of the economy is in private
ownership. Triple-digit inflation is countered by artificial price
controls and the printing of more currency. Chief trading partner
Russia helps subsidize economy by with fuel and raw materials.

   MINSK, Belarus _ This summer's heated dispute between Belarus
and the United States began with an abrupt demand from the
president's office: the American ambassador, and those of 20 other
countries, must leave their residences in an exclusive compound in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   It resulted in the angry departure in June of U.S. Ambassador
Daniel Speckhard and envoys from seven other nations, the largest
diplomatic exodus from a European country since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Cold War-style rhetoric followed. In Washington, the U.S. State
Department called President Alexander Lukashenko ``an authoritarian
dictator who is unable to understand the basic difference between
right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Vienna Convention, the treaty which states that
an embassy is the sovereign territory of the country it represents.
The agreement was last breached in 1979, when revolutionaries in
Iran swept into the U.S. embassy and took hostages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minsk, the press dubbed the diplomatic controversy the
``sewer war'' after Lukashenko said the evictions were necessary
because the luxury residences, near his own mansion, needed
plumbing repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the widely held view in Minsk is that Lukashenko, who rules
his country like a Soviet-era dictator, no longer wished to share
the compound, called Drozdy, with foreigners -- particularly the
Americans, whose residence was right across the fence from the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   The compound gates were locked, electricity and water to the
houses were cut off and a new brass plaque proclaimed Drozdy an
official presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   The Belarus foreign ministry explained that the compound, once a
collection of summer houses for Soviet-era officials, had always
been considered ``temporary housing for diplomats'' -- despite
long-term leases that, in the case of the American residence, ran
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Washington and Minsk have tangled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lukashenko aroused worldwide condemnation when his
government shot down and killed two American recreational
balloonists who were flying over Belarus during a race. Lukashenko
claimed they were spying and expressed no remorse.
</P>
<P>
   While America and other countries currently are without
ambassadors in Minsk, none has broken off relations, instead
keeping minimal staffs in place to monitor affairs and maintain
contacts with human rights activists, opposition leaders and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukashenko government offered to relocate the ambassadors
and their families to temporary housing until their countries could
build permanent residences. The offer was rejected because
maintained that they already had valid leases, and should not have
been pressured to move before the leases expired.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are few options facing the West. Over the past
year, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other
donors have suspended aid. Private foreign investment has slowed to
a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Minsk believe the eccentric Lukashenko relishes such
attention and isolation from the West, kindling his
self-perpetuated image as a champion of the Slavic people against
the approach of an expanding NATO and the influences of Western
culture and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Soviet times, the people were told we were always
surrounded by enemies,'' said Vladimir Glod(CQ), a former
journalist and outspoken critic of Lukashenko. ``This is simply a
return to the past.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Covering just 36 square miles, the island of Nevis is a
mere speck on the map of the Caribbean Sea. With only two large
grocery stores -- and no major airports or cruise ship docks --
it's the kind of place where straggling goats often stop traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its small size, some 6,000 voters will decide in a
referendum on Monday(Aug. 10) whether to secede from Nevis' big
sister, St. Kitts, located just two miles of water away.
</P>
<P>
   If two-thirds of those voting say yes, Nevis will become the
hemisphere's tiniest -- and one of the world's smallest --
independent nations, boasting a population of scarcely 11,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to go our separate ways,'' said Mark Brantley,
who chairs the Nevis Constitutional Committee and is a staunch
proponent of secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if we're involved in a limping marriage,'' he said.
``We may be together but we're not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The British first united the islands -- along with nearby
Anguilla -- more than a century ago. But Anguilla left the cluster
in 1967, before independence, and remains a British dependent
territory today.
</P>
<P>
   Nevis reluctantly joined St. Kitts in a federation after the two
islands won independence from Britain in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevisians have since complained of being treated like a
neglected stepchild instead of a valued sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-secessionists say that Nevis contributes 38 percent of the
federation's tax revenue, but only receives 21 percent of
government spending. As a result, they say Nevis has a deficient
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, St. Kitts enjoys the country's only
international airport and a deep-water channel for cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat us like second-class citizens,'' groused Malcolm
Guishard, Nevis' deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevis wants to determine its own destiny,'' he said. ``We
don't need them telling us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to a volcanic peak, Nevis was named ``Las Nieves'' --
Spanish for snow -- by Christopher Columbus because the island's
summit, shrouded in white clouds and mist, reminded him of the
snow-capped mountains in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Today the tourist-rich island is dominated by the posh Four
Seasons Resort Hotel, and has become a playground for the rich and
famous, including Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone and Robert
DeNiro. With more than 700 employees, the Four Seasons is the
island's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   The destination garnered even more cachet a few years ago when
Princess Diana vacationed in Nevis, accompanied by Princes William
and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of tourists shoots up every year, and there are new
hotels going up all the time, so Nevis has had great success with
this industry; more than St. Kitts has had,'' said Kenneth
Williams, who owns the Nevis Observer, the island's weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But besides tourism, there's also a $1.9 million-a-year offshore
business in Nevis, where 10,000 international business corporations
(IBCs) are registered, the majority of which are asset-protection
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   It was when the St. Kitts-Nevis government introduced new
financial regulations a few years ago to gain greater control of
investments and offshore business services in Nevis that the move
for secession really took off.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the economy of St. Kitts is driven mostly by a
troubled sugar industry, a smattering of assembly plants, and a
tourism industry that is less upscale than in Nevis, where some
hotel rooms fetch $500 a night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, St. Kitts has been plagued by drug-related crime in
recent years, further troubling image-conscious Nevis, which prides
itself on its number of churches -- 60.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the U.S. State Department reported that an accused
drug trafficker, Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller, threatened to
randomly kill U.S. veterinary students in St. Kitts if he lost his
fight against extradition.
</P>
<P>
   He and two other alleged drug traffickers believed to be in St.
Kitts are all under U.S. indictment for smuggling cocaine into the
United States, and a court in St. Kitts is now considering a U.S.
extradition request for them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have even urged Americans traveling to St. Kitts
to take precautions, along with the 250 students and 50 faculty
members at Ross Veterinary University.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the disparities and disagreements between the two
islands, Nevis' referendum on secession has raised concerns in an
era that has countries in the Caribbean working toward closer
economic and political integration.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded statement, Kenny Anthony, the chairman of
the 15-nation Caribbean Community, or Caricom, said the regional
trade and political group was disappointed over the planned vote.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said he was worried about ``the undesirable
fragmentation of the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from the U.S. State Department, spokesman James
Rubin expressed hope that the voters of Nevis will preserve their
historical ties to St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining the federation would be more compatible with the
trend toward greater regional integration, with all its
considerable benefits and advantages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Kitts-Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas also has lamented
the vote in Nevis, but said he'll do nothing to undermine the
effort to secede.
</P>
<P>
   He blames a ``flawed'' 1983 constitution for fomenting
discontent and separation.
</P>
<P>
   That constitution provides not only for 11 elected federal
parliamentarians -- eight from St. Kitts and three from Nevis --
but also for a five-member Nevis Island Assembly that has
substantial autonomy over local Nevis affairs. The federal
government has its seat in Basseterre, in St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution includes a provision that allows Nevis to
secede unilaterally, and the Nevis Island Assembly voted
unanimously last October to approve the secession vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to predict the outcome, there's a growing
sense that secession will succeed. In a non-binding vote in 1974,
about 80 percent of Nevisians favored secession.
</P>
<P>
   If pro-secessionists do succeed Monday, Nevis would become an
independent nation within the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very ready to end the abuse and neglect,'' Brantley
said bluntly. ``The relationship has always been an uneasy one.''

   WEST HORSLEY, England _ In late June, I stood on the front porch
of my mom and dad's place an hour south of Dallas and marveled at
the old plastic thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the temperature to be 112 degrees. I would have
thought it hotter. The heat was such that the wood of the porch
smelled as if it would soon burst into flames. Much of what Dad had
planted over the years to civilize their patch of prairie grasses
and mesquite trees was surrendering its last moisture, becoming
straw-colored and brittle. His organic garden, a source of pride
for a man who spent too many years living in cities, was barren.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their little home, the air-conditioners were working
frightfully hard to create an oasis of cool where a couple of older
people might survive, so long as they kept the doors and windows
sealed and ventured outside only moderately. They might as have
well been space travelers trapped in their spaceship on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Tempered somewhat by altitude and longitude, the heat also had
visited my home in Atlanta, where my garden was only slightly
better off than dad's. The tomatoes and greens I'd planted couldn't
seem to get enough water to provide much of a salad. The
honeysuckle planted on the arbor in May didn't make it to July.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the relief of arriving to this place, where a cool
spell is caressing an already mild climate. The garden at Meadows
-- that's the name of the house we leased south of London; we don't
use anything so impersonal as street numbers in West Horsley _ is
lush and brilliant with purples, reds and whites. The grass is
thick, soft and green. My apple trees are heavy with fruit and the
berries are making the birds crazy.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, it was sunny with a high of 73 degrees. I
sat on the patio reading tacky English newspapers and reveling in
the glory of this early fall or late spring or whatever it is.
Really, it's as if the weather gods have knitted spring to fall
without using a summer at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, you need a jacket -- a fashion necessity anyway
to a man of a certain age beset with the humbling combination of
vanity and pudginess. At night, you need a light blanket.
</P>
<P>
   I feel some guilt, but not much, when I see stories in the
London press about the miseries of the American broil. (Am I crazy
or do I detect a suggestion by the writers that the uppity
colonists at last are getting their due?)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the English television weather ``Kens'' and ``Barbies,''
like their American cousins, are putting on their grim faces to
report their own weather disaster: The Missing Summer. No one can
find it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I gather that this is bad news to people who pass all those
drizzly months of leaden skies longing desperately for the heat, if
you can call it that, of summer. People here are talking about how
the weather has damaged the British tourism industry and generally
made everyone cranky.
</P>
<P>
   In record numbers, Britons are fleeing to the warmth of southern
France, Spain and Florida, where they can frolic on the beaches,
exposing their alarmingly unprepared white bodies to searing
ultraviolet sunrays. (I wonder if there's a market for a travel
package to sunny, exotic central Texas?)
</P>
<P>
   Well, they can have it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remain in the natural air-conditioning, testing the various
ales and beers you can buy in the little store down Ockham Road
from Meadows in a quest for a regular brand.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll remain to watch the bloom. My soul needs to see at
least one garden come to full flower this summer.

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Police sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day after
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd
at the airport or on the streets for hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment at this harsh treatment reminds me of
African-Americans in the United States who are needlessly hassled
by local police.
</P>
<P>
   My brushes with security have been understandable. An army
patrol flagged down my car and searched it as I drove away from the
family of a Hamas bomb-maker who had recently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to display articles in my lap-top computer to prove
that my travels in Arab areas were for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   These checks can be a nuisance. They are not going to eliminate
terrorism. But, on the way into the airplane or the movies, they
can also be a little reassuring.

   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd
at the airport or on the streets for hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment at this harsh treatment reminds me of
African-Americans in the United States who are needlessly hassled
by local police.
</P>
<P>
   My brushes with security have been understandable. An army
patrol flagged down my car and searched it as I drove away from the
family of a Hamas bomb-maker who had recently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to display articles in my lap-top computer to prove
that my travels in Arab areas were for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   These checks can be a nuisance. They are not going to eliminate
terrorism. But, on the way into the airplane or the movies, they
can also be a little reassuring.

   &UR; World War II In the Movies &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a show,'' an officer tells the troops
gathering in England for the invasion depicted in the Academy
Award-nominated documentary ``D-Day Remembered.'' This summer's
D-Day show, of course, with its horrific carnage in the water and
on the beaches, takes place in Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' Adding no small degree of poignancy to the scene is a fact
pointed out in the documentary: fewer than 15 percent of the troops
who slogged ashore in Normandy that day had ever been in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Spielberg epic will serve as backdrop for a
quieter investigation of the war. This time the medium is video,
but the films, a collection of award-winning documentaries, will be
available not in stores but at the public library.
</P>
<P>
   The series, ``From Rosie to Roosevelt: A Film History of
Americans in World War II,'' is to be introduced in 20 libraries
across the country. The effort is a joint project of National Video
Resources _ a New York organization that helps to mount and finance
independently produced films and videos _ the National Endowment
for the Humanities, the American Library Association and the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to promote thought and discussion about the war.
``One of the things library programs can do is fill people's need
to get together and engage in discourse,'' said Sally
Mason-Robinson, director of library projects for National Video
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes six weekly sessions. At each library, a
scholar from a college in the area will introduce the films, some
of which are set on the battlefield and others on the home front.
The documentaries, it is hoped, will stimulate discussion not so
much about the details of battles as their origins and their
consequences and, for older people,stir personal recollections and
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, there is much basic history to be taught. In
``Days of Waiting,'' an Academy Award winner about the internment
of Japanese-Americans, an internee who committed suicide lies
beside railroad tracks, having killed himself by placing his head
on the rail. The image is as stark as some in ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie, of course, is the heroine of ``The Life and Times of
Rosie the Riveter.'' In ``F.D.R.,'' a Peabody and DuPont award
winner, President Roosevelt gains approval of the 1941 Lend-Lease
Act to get weapons to the desperate British while maneuvering
around isolationist critics, who opposed providing the money to buy
them. Let the British borrow the weapons ``like a garden hose,
you'd lend it to a neighbor and they'd give it back,'' says the
narrator in ``F.D.R.'' Roosevelt was so sure the country would
support lend-lease that he filled the Atlantic with supply ships on
their way to England before he even signed the document.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George C. Marshall has a different challenge in ``George
Marshall and the American Century.'' President Roosevelt had just
appointed him to prepare what was then still a largely untrained
and unseasoned Army. ``The trouble with the Army,'' Marshall says,
``was that there wasn't any Army.''
</P>

Mason-Robinson at (312) 491-0844 or send an e-mail query to

</P>
<P>
   Basting in his bubble bath, his head phones turned high, Jeff
Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) doesn't hear the intruders, who toss an
attack ferret in the water with him and then deface his living room
rug. Seems that this Lebowski, a loosely strung fellow called the
Dude, has been mistaken for the big Lebowski, a tycoon (David
Huddleston) with a missing wife named Bunny (Tara Reid). Hired to
find Bunny, the Dude balances that assignment with all the doings
at the bowling alley where he congregates with the dim-witted Donny
(Steve Buscemi) and the blustery Vietnam veteran Walter (John
Goodman, above). After the more mainstream ``Fargo,'' Joel and
Ethan Coen are after something loopier here, and, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, their ``ensemble players are as funny
and as harmonious as they've ever been.'' _1998. Polygram. $108.01.

   So which Leonardo DiCaprio is it to be: the arrogant, spoiled
Louis XIV or the shy, decent Philippe, Louis' twin, who has been
locked away in the dungeon with the iron mask to disguise him? In
Randall Wallace's cheesy adaptation of the Dumas story, nostrils
flare in the kitschy showdown between the two Leos after Philippe
has been sprung by the three musketeers (John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu and Jeremy Irons), but ``the haste with which this
laborious costume drama has been slapped together is strongly
apparent'' (Maslin).

<P>
   Wearing a veneer of civility with his formal wear, Robbie (Adam
Sandler) croons at other people's weddings while still nursing the
wounds of his own abandonment at the altar by a fiancee who at the
last second figured she could do better. In testier moments, the
memory of it drives Robbie from the schlock he usually sings to the
kind of insulting repartee at the microphone that gets him slugged
by outraged clients. Fortunately, there's Julia (Drew Barrymore), a
sunny waitress, to soften the edge in a film ``with enough
enjoyable silliness to please Sandler's fans'' (Maslin).

unfavorable light. Jackie back-flips into the fray, sending legions
of heavies flying with a quick chop to the jowls, and a lot of
things get broken. Beyond that, there's not much else to say about

   A LESSON IN LOVE (1954, 95 minutes) and THE DEVIL'S EYE (1960,
90 minutes). If you want to catch Ingmar Bergman in a playful mood,
``Lesson'' is an opportunity. The story of a middle-aged
gynecologist (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who breaks off an affair with a
married 21-year-old patient (Yvonne Lombard) but whose philandering
ways have alienated his wife (Eva Dahlbeck), who is in her own
affair with an old amour, may not tickle every funny bone, but it
counts as a Bergman foray into comedy. More humorous, perhaps, is
Bergman's ``Devil's Eye'' (1960), in which Don Juan is sent back to
earth by the devil to seduce a young woman who finds him more
comical than alluring. Both films are reissued by Home Vision.

 &HT;    HOUSE FINALLY PASSES BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Applauding themselves wildly, House members
concluded months of debate Thursday by sending the Senate a
bipartisan campaign finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would bar unlimited ``soft money'' gifts to parties and
restrict ``issue ads'' that are broadcast by nonparty groups in the
closing days of congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scotty Baesler of Kentucky, a leader among the ``Blue Dog''
Democrats whose bipartisan petition drive among House members
forced GOP leaders to permit the debate, scoffed at predictions
that the bill would never pass the Senate, where a similar bill was
blocked by a Republican filibuster in February.
</P>
<P>
   Gleefully, he tallied more than a dozen times since last fall
that pundits or opponents called efforts to change campaign finance
laws ``dead'' or ``really dead'' or ``really really dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who say we will see Elvis before this bill is passed by
the Senate ... are the same people who said the House would never
pass it,'' Baesler declared.
</P>
<P>
   The 252-179 vote for final passage was a long-awaited victory
for supporters of the bill shaped by Reps. Chris Shays, R-Conn.,
and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.. The measure was eventually endorsed by
President Clinton, Democratic congressional and party leaders and a
coalition of nonpartisan advocacy groups led by Common Cause and
the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one Republicans, 10 more than had voted for the
Shays-Meehan vote in a do-or-die preliminary showdown Monday,
joined 190 Democrats and one independent on Thursday's final vote.
They were opposed by 164 Republicans and 15 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to banning corporate or union gifts to parties,
putting enforceable limits on the size of gifts by individuals to
parties and regulating pre-election broadcast ads, the Shays-Meehan
bill would tighten disclosure rules and create a nonpartisan
commission to suggest further changes to the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Though House Republican leaders were eventually rebuffed by the
House, they too could claim some consolation prizes. Because of the
leaders' adamant opposition, the co-sponsors had to water down
their bill in order to attract enough GOP rebels.
</P>
<P>
   And by stretching out the confrontation for nine months after
the start of the petition drive, the leaders made the debate far
too complex for routine TV coverage and shortened the time period
in which Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will have to
maneuver in order to avoid a straight up-or-down vote on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate began its summer vacation July 31. When it reconvenes
after Labor Day, it will have only one month before adjournment to
deal with a long list of other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, according to Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the Shays-Meehan proposal has the best chance of
any of the alternatives discussed during the House debate, because
52 of the 100 senators already support a similar bill co-sponsored
by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of any other measure in the House _ no matter how
well-intentioned _ would only have the effect of offering political
cover for the opponents of reform to kill the bill in the Senate,''
Daschle said in a statement circulated to House members prior to
Thursday's final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before sending the Shays-Meehan bill to the Senate, the House on
Thursday swiftly debated and killed several substitutes that were
weaker or stricter than the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   The last alternative to go down was a slightly milder proposal
created by an unofficial bipartisan task force led by Reps. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and and Tom Allen, D-Maine. That plan received
only 147 votes, while 222 opposed their plan and 61 sympathizers
voted ``present'' in order to keep the Shays-Meehan bill alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not let the good be used to get in the way of the
better,'' urged Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, in opposing the
freshman bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan told reporters that they would hold a strategy
session Tuesday with McCain and Feingold, whose bill was blocked
earlier this year when they obtained only 52 of the 60 votes needed
to end a GOP filibuster in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're eight votes short, but there are senators like Al
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-Colo.) who are
involved in races in states where many voters like campaign
reforms,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing a House member says will change the outcome in the
Senate,'' commented Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn. ``I believe that it
is only if American citizens speak out with a loud and clear voice,
that we will get the additional votes needed in the Senate.''

A WOMAN ROBS THE CRADLE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ After a spate of movies involving older men with
women young enough to be their daughters, there's finally a film
that turns the subject upside down: an older woman with a much
younger man. It's a topic that Hollywood generally ignores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain level of taboo about that, which is why so
many women keep it a secret,'' said Terry McMillan, author of the
novel ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' and co-author, with Ron
Bass, of the screenplay for the film version, which opens on Aug.
14. (It is also showing Friday night in Manhattan at the Urbanworld
International Film Festival.) ``It's taboo because you look as if
you might be desperate and it's all sexual, which is not the case
at all. My thing is, men do it all the time. Let's not make a big
deal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film of Ms. McMillan's novel ``Waiting to Exhale'' was one
of 20th Century Fox's big hits in 1995. The movie, which cost $14
million, grossed $67 million in the United States and tapped an
audience that had been ignored by Hollywood: black women.
</P>
<P>
   The new film stars Angela Bassett as a successful investment
banker and 40-year-old single mother from Northern California who
goes to Jamaica and embarks on a serious relationship with a
20-year-old student, played by Taye Diggs, who appeared in
``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McMillan, who lives in Northern California, said the Bassett
character was patterned after herself. In 1995, Ms. McMillan said,
she flew to Jamaica on the spur of the moment because events of the
previous year had left her incapable of writing. ``My mother had
suddenly died, my best friend had suddenly died, and I couldn't
write a word after that,'' she recalled. ``I decided to go to
Jamaica and break the monotony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there a couple of days and met this young man who worked
in a hotel _ of course I didn't take it seriously,'' she continued.
``But then we befriended each other. I went back home. And to make
a long story short, two or three months later he moved up here with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McMillan said her friend, Jonathan Plummer, who is now
attending college in Northern California, is in his 20s. ``That's
all I'm saying _ and I'm 46,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Schindler, who produced the movie as well as ``Waiting
to Exhale,'' and is a friend of the author, said: ``I still
remember her call from Jamaica. She said, `I'm having the most
outrageous time.' After she got back, she started writing this
book.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been notable exceptions to Hollywood's tendency to
avoid stories about older women and younger men, for example, the
1973 film ``40 Carats,'' in which a 40-ish Liv Ullmann is pursued
by a 20-ish Edward Albert. But Ms. Schindler and Ms. McMillan said
the norm is films with older men and younger women. Some recent
examples: Warren Beatty, 61, and Halle Berry, 31, in ``Bulworth'';
Michael Douglas, 53, and Gwyneth Paltrow, 25, in ``A Perfect
Murder''; Jack Nicholson, 61, and Helen Hunt, 35, in ``As Good as
It Gets,'' and Robert Redford, 61, and Kristin Scott Thomas, 38, in
``The Horse Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McMillan laughed at the response of some women at early
screenings. ``Women practically had their airline tickets to
Jamaica in hand after they saw the movie,'' she said. ``But I told
them, `You guys miss the point.' The point isn't, gee whiz, I fell
in love with this younger guy. The point is, it's really about a
woman's right to choose her own path when it comes to happiness and
be willing to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men do it all the time, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Living Happily So Far &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Tennant, the director and co-screenwriter of ``Ever After:
A Cinderella Story,'' the latest movie version of the fairy tale,
given a feminist twist, summed up Hollywood's conventional wisdom
about Drew Barrymore, the film's female lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about certain stars like Drew,'' Tennant
said. ``The camera loves them. It's sort of undefinable. It's in
the genes, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that the 23-year-old Ms. Barrymore, a
member of the famous and tortured Barrymore acting clan and a
granddaughter of John Barrymore, would have emerged as a respected
and coveted actress after a childhood that seemed straight out of a
terrible Hollywood novel.
</P>
<P>
   At age 6, Ms. Barrymore got a top role in ``E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial,'' but then endured publicized drug and alcohol
problems at 12, a rehab stint at 13, a suicide attempt at 14, and a
marriage and divorce at 20. She enjoyed playing bad girls, on and
off screen, and seemed destined to be a front-page fixture on
supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Barrymore now seems not only poised for major
stardom but has also apparently straightened out her life so that,
the actress said with a laugh, she's become a very average person.
She said she watches CNN, reads newspapers carefully and is a
strict vegetarian. She speaks of spirituality, is popular on movie
sets and seems to live the kind of stable life that once seemed
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrymore attributed the changes, in part, to accepting
responsibility for her problems. Seven years ago, she also took
control of her career from her mother, Jaid, who had been her
manager. The two barely speak now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, it's not there,'' she said, a bit cryptically.
</P>
<P>
   Of her blossoming career, she said: ``I've had the kind of life
that appreciates a slow pace now. I like the fact that my career
has been a gradual process.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began taking her acting seriously with her appearance
in ``Boys on the Side,'' ``Batman Forever,'' ``The Wedding
Singer,'' ``Scream'' (a memorable cameo) and Woody Allen's
``Everyone Says I Love You.'' She is making a new film, ``Never
Been Kissed,'' about a newspaper reporter in Chicago who poses as a
high school student to report on what teen-agers are thinking _ and
winds up rediscovering herself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrymore said the new approach to Cinderella in ``Ever
After'' intrigued her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different Cinderella; I wouldn't have wanted to play
a woman who waits to be rescued,'' she said. ``This is not only a
woman who doesn't wait to be rescued; she rescues others. She's
smart and well read and ahead of her time; she's incredibly strong.
That's what's so appealing about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrymore is a national spokeswoman for the nonprofit Female
Health Foundation, which focuses on safe-sex education for young
women. She said that understanding her childhood and teen-age
years, as strange and troubled as they were, had led her to work
outside the movie business and seek to help troubled girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We experience so much in our lives,'' Ms. Barrymore said.
``The truth is, we need to find empowerment and strength out of
those experiences rather than allow them to be an excuse for
bitterness or having it cripple us. It would have been easy for me
to be crippled by the past. But I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Not `The Parent Trap' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years ago, the director Jacques Demy and the
composer Michel Legrand teamed up to make ``The Young Girls of
Rochefort'' (``Les Demoiselles de Rochefort''), a Gallic homage to
the American musical, especially the films of Vincente Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   The film, an elegant fairy tale about twin sisters, starred
Catherine Deneuve as Delphine and her sister, Francoise Dorleac, as
Solange. Newly restored, it is set to be re-released in New York on
Aug. 14 and elsewhere in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember most was the joy of making it,'' Ms. Deneuve
said. ``Gene Kelly was in the film and we were so amazed that on
the set he was like he was on the screen: white pants, charming,
seeming to work without any effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But watching the film, originally released in 1967, is
bittersweet for Ms. Deneuve. She and her sister were selected for
their roles by Legrand and Demy (who died in 1990) over actresses
more famous at the time: Brigitte Bardot and Geraldine Chaplin, and
Ms. Bardot and Jeanne Moreau. Soon after the film was finished, Ms.
Dorleac died in a car accident in Nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it's less difficult to watch this film than others
with my sister,'' Ms. Deneuve said. ``It was the only film I did
with her, but it was a musical. The scenes are so charming and
related to what we were as sisters in real life. Somehow it's more
difficult to see her in other films.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was part of Demy's romantic trilogy, which included
``Lola'' (1961) and ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' (1964). Its
restoration was undertaken mostly because of the determination of
Agnes Varda, the filmmaker and Demy's widow. ``The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg,'' which made Ms. Deneuve a star, was also re-released,
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Musicals are out of time, I suppose,'' Ms. Deneuve said. ``You
can't do musicals today with the lightness and atmosphere that
those musicals had. Those days are finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Deneuve, who lives in France, visits the United States
frequently, and has considered finding an apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement of life in New York: you're always working,
it's a very busy city, very beautiful,'' she said. ``I could not
live in Los Angeles. It's very artificial to me.''

&HT;        HOUSE OK'S REFORM, NIXES FROSH BILL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- The House reaffirmed its support Thursday
for a ban on unlimited campaign contributions from special
interests to political parties, casting aside a similar but less
restrictive effort by freshmen lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen could not round up enough support from House
Democrats, many of whom applauded the freshmen effort but said the
stronger reform bill was the one drafted by Reps. Chris Shays,
R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And some proponents of Shays-Meehan, which had already received
237 votes earlier this week, said the freshmen bill was a
``respectable fall-back position'' earlier this year when passing
Shays-Meehan was in doubt. With enough votes to now pass their
bill, Shays-Meehan supporters feared that reform opponents would
vote for the freshmen bill in an effort to pass the weaker bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshmen bill has now become Custer's Last Stand for those
who oppose reform,'' said Rep. Charles Bass, R-Vt., who voted for
Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
who co-wrote the freshmen bill, vigorously defended their plan --
which would have banned ``soft money'' contributions to the
national parties -- as a constitutionally palatable alternative
free of federal mandates on state and local elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good, solid, substantial reform,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Allen and Hutchinson received 147 votes in support
of their bill, with 121 coming from Republicans. There were 222
``no'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   As a show of support to the freshmen, who were the first in the
105th Congress to hold any hearings on campaign finance reform, 60
Democrats and one Republican voted ``present'' -- meaning they
supported the bill but were afraid to vote for it in fear that it
would gain more votes than Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who voted ``present'' were House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt and House Minority Whip David Bonior. ``We would not
be at this point in passing real campaign reform were it not for
their commitment,'' Bonior, D-Mich., said of Allen's campaign task
force.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the freshmen bill, the House was forced to
re-vote on Shays-Meehan, which it did, giving the reform measure
another resounding victory, 252-179.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strongest bill that we have before us,'' said Rep.
John Baldacci, D-Bangor, who voted for Shays-Meehan and ``present''
on Hutchinson-Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Baldacci said it was an important matter of consistency to make
sure Shays-Meehan was sent to the Senate, which has a similar
version to the House bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Russ Feingold, D-Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the passage of Shays-Meehan, it is questionable
whether the Senate will take up McCain-Feingold, which could only
muster the support of 52 senators last spring, eight short of the
60 needed to break filibuster tactics. And time is tight: on
vacation until September, senators will return for just one month,
before leaving town in early October for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   If ever approved by both chambers, President Clinton has vowed
to sign Shays-Meehan. It would end the soft money contributions by
unions, corporations and other special interests to the political
parties, which have been at the center of investigations into
illegal donations to the Democrats in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen bill allowed for soft money donations to state
parties, something opponents said would result in a mere shift of
big money from party headquarters in Washington to state parties in
places like Augusta. ``It is well intended,'' Shays said. ``But it
is also a gigantic loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays-Meehan also banned independent groups from airing attack
ads against candidates within 60 days of an election, something
Allen and Hutchinson called constitutionally questionable as a
limit on 1st Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Allen contended his bill would prohibit candidates for federal
office from raising soft money for their state parties, eliminating
the biggest problem soft money presents -- lawmakers who do favors
for the biggest of the big donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is real reform. That is a real soft money ban,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even some freshmen campaign task force members backed away
from Allen's bill, voting present to support Shays-Meehan. ``Not
because (Allen's bill) represents artificial reform, as some on
both sides of the aisle have suggested,'' said Rep. Harold Ford,
D-Tenn., ``but because it has become a tool (of reform
opponents).''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past nine weeks of debate on campaign finance, the
House voted on eight different plans. With 147 ``yes'' votes and 61
``present'' votes, Allen's bill easily received the second most
votes of any plan.

   THE ANDAMAN SEA _ The journey promised adventure, but we didn't
know the half of it. The idea of sailing through waters off the
coast of Myanmar _ formerly known as Burma, and shut off from the
outside world for the past half-century _ seduced nine intrepid
travelers who had previously done plenty of exploring in exotic
places. Here was a chance to investigate a tiny part of the world
inhabited only by sea gypsies and by wild monkeys and other
assorted beasts, a section of Southeast Asia that was last
effectively documented when European traders came from India to
explore the famous Silk Road. So, in October, when we boarded the
trimaran appropriately named the Wanderlust, we were among the
first 100 Westerners to take such a voyage since Burmese officials
opened their part of the Andaman Sea _ in the easternmost Indian
Ocean _ to outsiders late in 1996. By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ. Story

EMBRACING THE GYPSY CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget yoga, tai chi, psychotherapy and monastery vacations. The
antidote for the quiet desperation and alienation of contemporary
urban lives is much simpler: become a Gypsy. Gypsies are wacky,
fun-loving and hard-drinking; they have a hearty appetite for sex,
a visceral connection with music and a real sense of community. The
women bathe in pairs with flowers in their hair. What's more, the
men can do shoe repair.
</P>
<P>
   At least that seems to be the message of ``Gadjo Dilo,'' the
third in Tony Gatlif's Gypsy trilogy. In 1994, Gatlif wrote and
directed ``Latcho Drom,'' sort of a musical travelogue of Gypsy
culture. Last year, in ``Mondo,'' he told the story of a homeless
Gypsy boy in France.
</P>
<P>
   His intriguing, skillfully made new film is in love with its
subjects. ``Gadjo Dilo'' opens with a shot of Stephane (Romain
Duris) walking, in shoes that are coming apart, in the middle of a
desolate road covered with snow and ice. When he finally reaches a
building with lights on, it's locked. He's soon joined by a very
drunk man shouting: ``May I die! May I rot!'' and lamenting the
injustice of his son having just been sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Against his better judgment, Stephane accepts the man's offer of
a place to sleep. The next morning, two little boys scream with a
combination of terror and pleasure, ``There's a great big gadjo
sleeping at our place!'' Gadjo, in the Gypsies' Romany language,
means outsider. Dilo, as in the film's title, means crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane, a sophisticated Parisian, has a good reason for being
here. To honor his dead father, he has come to locate the father's
favorite singer and record her for posterity. Needless to say, he
does not immediately make contact with her but finds himself drawn
into an exotic new lifestyle instead.
</P>
<P>
   Izidor (Isidor Serban), his host, is horrified when Stephane
tries to spruce up the place. ``Aren't you ashamed of yourself for
cleaning my house?'' he asks. Two women, observing Stephane's
dusting and sweeping, conclude that he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Sabina (Rona Hartner), the village's fallen woman (for some
reason connected with a stay in Belgium), is pretty sure he's not.
Her idea of letting him know she doesn't want his attentions is to
bite his hand, then raise her skirts revealing her bare bottom to
him. Despite that initial lack of interest, Stephane is soon making
love to her hungrily. He is also dancing in a near-trance in
Bucharest, drinking vodka and crying out: ``May I die! May I rot!''
Just as it's time for him to go back to Paris, tragedy strikes the
Gypsies. The question is whether Stephane will stay in this
new-found but misunderstood utopia or return to the world he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlif, who wrote and directed the film, and Eric Guichard, his
cinematographer, have done well. The film contains gorgeous shots
of the forest blanketed in snow, heartwarming and hysterical
wedding scenes and a moment of inspired silent-film-style humor
when a man tries to get his double bass past a clothesline.  &QL;

TEXAS AUDIT WARNS OF POTENTIAL DPS PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF 2000 YEAR
GLITCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Millions of public safety and crime records are
at risk because the Texas Department of Public Safety has been slow
to address potential year 2000 computer glitches, the state auditor
warns.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's office, in a report issued this week, concluded
that the computer problem and several other management weaknesses
``challenge the department's ability to provide efficient and
effective public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that DPS, whose management has been criticized
in previous audits, hasn't conducted a comprehensive review of its
own organizational structure in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other state agencies as well as governments and businesses
around the world are scrambling to solve the year 2000 computer
problem. It is the result of most computer programs recognizing
years by only the final two digits. That is, the year 2000 could be
recognized by computers as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the DPS computer system are criminal histories,
drivers license records, accident reports and other information
routinely needed each day by law enforcement officers, insurance
companies, employers and private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS, in a formal response to the report, said it plans to
complete by the end of the year a contingency plan for dealing with
possible service interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman Mike Cox said the agency also has signed a
contract with an outside vendor for correcting any potential
glitches in the agency's mainframe systems. Cox said that work,
which should protect most agency records, is to be completed within
15 months and within DPS' budget.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor said DPS' potential computer problem has been
compounded by employee turnover _ in part because of low salaries
for agency computer specialists _ and by waiting too long to
address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   According to the auditor, DPS received information on possible
year 2000 computer glitches more than 30 months ago from the
Department of Information Resources. Then in January, that
department issued a warning that changes to the DPS computer system
``may not be completed in time to avoid disruption in some of the
DPS functions that are critical to Texas state government.''
</P>
<P>
   But DPS didn't complete an inventory of its automation systems
until May of this year, which hampered planning.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also noted that cost estimates for correcting DPS'
computer problems _ as high as $20 million to $40 million _ far
exceed the agency's available funding of $12 million.

AGENCY ASSURES CONGRESS AIR TRAFFIC WILL BE SAFE ON JAN. 1, 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Federal Aviation Administration official told
Congress Thursday that top FAA officials will fly coast-to-coast on
Jan. 1, 2000, to show that the computer-driven air traffic control
system hasn't been made unsafe by Year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Long, director of the FAA's Year 2000 program, assured the
House committee on technology that the agency will be fully and
safely operational when Dec. 31, 1999, arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Long and FAA administrator Jane Garvey will fly from the
East Coast to the West Coast on New Year's Day, 2000, starting at
midnight, Long told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demonstration of our confidence in the system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 closes in, agencies and companies alike have
been scrambling to fix computers that were originally programmed to
recognize only the last two digits of a year, as in ``99'' for the
year 1999. Some computers are expected to fail or malfunction on
Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines might assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssen, the General Accounting Office's director of
civil agencies information systems, told the subcommittee there was
a chance that the FAA wouldn't be fully operational on Dec. 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA hasn't done enough to assure the GAO that all FAA-linked
computers, such as national air traffic control, have fixed the
Year 2000 glitch, also known as Y2K, Willemssen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FAA fixes the Y2K problem in its main computer
systems, separate systems that link the ``mission-critical''
computers to one another may still have Y2K programming problems,
according to Willemssen. ``Critical systems may fail,'' he added,
if the glitch is not repaired in all the linking systems, which
keep air traffic control information flowing.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 31, the FAA had not accounted for all of the
interfaces that hook up the agency's computers, he said. FAA plans
to fix the Y2K problem by next June 30 are overly optimistic,
Willemssen said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an FAA official who said making one modification to a
computer system can take from four weeks to six weeks to test and
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Falling behind schedule in fixing the problem ``could affect
hundreds of thousands of people,'' he said. ``This is a tremendous
challenge.''

HISPANIC POPULATION NEARS 30 MILLION; EXPECTED TO TRIPLE BY 2050 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: For release at 12:01 a.m. Friday, Aug. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fueled by immigration and higher birth rates, the
number of Hispanics living in the United States grew to nearly 30
million in 1997, a trend that is projected to triple their
population by 2050, according to a Census Bureau report released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics now make up 11 percent of the U.S. population, up from
9 percent in 1990, according to Census Bureau statistics. The
bureau projects that number will jump to 25 percent by 2050, when
the Hispanic population is expected to reach 96.5 million _ more
than 10 times its number in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel de la Puente, chief of the ethnic and Hispanic statistics
branch of the U.S. Census Bureau, said immigration from Mexico and
Central American countries is the main impetus for the steep rise
in Hispanics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at where immigrants to the United States are
coming from, there has been a complete reversal from the turn of
the century when the vast majority of immigrants came from Europe
and only a few came from Mexico, Central America and Asia,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, 98 percent of immigrants came from Europe. By 1990, the
percentage of immigrants from Europe fell to 26 percent, while the
percentage of immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries grew to 43
percent. Immigrants from Asian countries also increased to 25
percent of the 1990 total.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new Census report, fewer than half, 44 percent,
of the current Latino population was born outside the United
States. For the country as a whole, 9.7 percent of the population
is foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   De la Puente added that a higher birth rate among Hispanics also
has contributed to their rising numbers. ``Since immigrants tend to
be younger than the population as whole, they also tend to have
more children,'' he said. About a third _ 35.7 percent _ of
Hispanics were under 18 last year, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
   De la Puente said Hispanics are expected to outnumber blacks by
2005, which would make them the country's largest minority group.
Earlier this year, the number of Hispanic school children for the
first time was larger than the number of black school children.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report also said that Hispanics continue to
get married and stay married in higher numbers than the overall
population. Nearly seven of every 10 Hispanic families (68.2
percent) consisted of married couples in 1997. The number of
non-Hispanic white families who were married couples in 1997 was
about 60 percent. The comparable number for black families was 42
percent and for Asian families, 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all of our numbers, Hispanics appear to be very
family-oriented people,'' de la Puente said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that more than a quarter of Hispanic
families in the United States (26.4 percent) were living below the
poverty line in 1996, compared with 14 percent for the overall U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the Hispanic jobless rate in 1997 was 9.2
percent. For the entire population, the rate was 4.9 percent.

<P>
   ``Just one Clinton joke,'' a man in the audience called out when
Jerry Seinfeld appeared for his encore after the second show on
Wednesday, opening night of his brief run of stand-up performances
on Broadway. It says everything about his humor that the only
topical joke came by request, and even then it wasn't a genuine
Clinton joke. He veered smoothly away from politics into typical
Seinfeld territory, wryly observing the manners and absurdities of
contemporary life. ``Everyone lies about sex,'' he said. ``People
lie  &UR; during &LR;  sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd  &UR; be &LR;  no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Those jokes were recycled from a news conference promoting the
live telecast of this show (Sunday night 9 on HBO), but no matter.
Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm
Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway.'' Looking
backward is. New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television
show the final performance in a two-month world tour. That amounts
to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he
will retire.
</P>
<P>
   These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they
say a lot about his past. He comes full circle here, back to the
stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in
the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended
with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act. On Broadway, that
act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed
and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and
his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he
worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines,
Iowa, he gave away all the tickets. Most shows on the tour sold
out; some didn't. But New York is home, the audience was primed to
adore him, and all he really had to do was show up. He did more.
Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled,
hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted
observations.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final
``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he
became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his
style of stand-up has become.
</P>
<P>
   He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so
purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's
with the cabbies and the b.o.?'' He went on to talk about the
lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions
given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt
in case you haven't been in a car since 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he
has already given away so many himself. It is nearly impossible to
give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that
he has none. ``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're
hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though,
``They've seen the fork.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than
sitcom Jerry ever was. And he makes more funny faces. He imitated a
turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as
well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey. ``That's the
look you have on your face when you're that close to being the
dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it.'' He
interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so
much that he lost control. To someone who threw a business card
with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read
it. I'm busy!''
</P>
<P>
   Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular,
relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines. His
opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the
comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic
energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool
Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately
retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine
in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a
bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable. The
HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and
unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld.'')
</P>
<P>
   On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live. When I screw
up, you see it.'' He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted
routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material
out to pasture. After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for
something new, maybe even risky.
</P>
<P>
   One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo
for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting
as his next career. He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas
while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll
go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out. ``How could
it not work out?'' he wonders. He looks goofily pleased with
himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of
something new. It may be a goof, but it holds promise.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Weather changes will be slow over most of the nation as weak
winds at high levels persist. Cool and unsettled conditions will
linger over much of the Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, while
high pressure keeps most of the East warm with little rain. The
interior West will stay mainly sunny and very warm.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-moving showers and a few thunderstorms will surround a
sluggish low pressure center over southern Minnesota. Rather cloudy
and cool conditions with generally light showers will occur from
the southern Missouri Valley to the western Great Lakes. Recurrent
showers will produce locally heavy rain in the sultry air from the
southern Great Lakes to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, although
some dim sunshine will alternate with the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Northeast will have another day with ample sunshine.
Humidity will gradually increase, especially near the west slopes
of the Appalachians and at the coast. Clouds and some showers will
occur over the mountains of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be seasonably warm and humid.
Cloudiness will prevail near the Carolina coast as clusters of
offshore thundershowers drift near the region. Strong thunderstorms
will be scattered over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will remain below the seasonal average over the
southern Plains. A few heavy showers will linger over eastern
Texas, but little rain will fall elsewhere in the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be dry. However, a few strong
thunderstorms will form near a front in the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dry Brownsville
</P>
<P>
   Since March 17, measurable rain has fallen at Brownsville,
Texas, on only four days, with 0.17 inches the greatest daily
rainfall. From March 17 to August 5, a time when rates of
evaporation of surface water increase and rain becomes crucial,
only 0.35 inches of rain have been measured. The town's average
rainfall for the period is 9.67 inches. Though located close to the
tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Brownsville is modestly moist,
with an annual average of 27 inches. Like dry Brownsville, most of
south Texas has received less than a half an inch of rain from
April through July.

 &HT;    HISPANIC POPULATION NEARS 30 MILLION
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Hispanic population in the United States is
nearing 30 million and growing at a rate that may help it eclipse
African Americans sooner than anticipated as the nation's largest
minority group, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Friday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics totaled 29.7 million in 1997, about 11 percent of the
U.S. population, according to the report. African Americans
numbered 34.2 million in 1997, or 12.8 percent of the population,
according to a Census Bureau report released a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic experts have predicted in recent years that the
Hispanic population would exceed the African American population in
the year 2005. But the new figures suggest that could occur as soon
as the 2000 census _ partly depending on whether Republicans in
Congress allow the use of statistical sampling techniques to
compensate for undercounting of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintained all along that Hispanics have been
undercounted by the Census Bureau,'' said Lisa Navarrete,
spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, the nation's
largest Hispanic advocacy group. ``We think that will be clear
after the 2000 census.''
</P>
<P>
   John Reed, a Census Bureau analyst, said the latest population
figures ``do not surprise us.'' He noted, for instance, that the
Census Bureau reported last month that the number of Hispanic
children in this country surpassed the number of African American
children.
</P>
<P>
   Today's report also revealed that within the Hispanic
population:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Slightly more than half, 55.8 percent, were born in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 68 percent of families were married-couple families.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About a third, 35.7 percent, were under 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly a fourth, 24 percent, work in technical, sales and
administrative support positions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Census Bureau data reflect the continuing effects of
immigration. A decade ago, more than 62 percent of Hispanics in the
United States were U.S.-born, a percentage that continues to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   But Sonia Perez, the chief demographic researcher for La Raza,
noted that two-thirds of the Hispanics under the age of 18 were
born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very young population,'' she said. ``And it's in the
interest of the country to be developing these young people and
making sure they have the opportunities they need to be successful,
not just for our community, but because it has implications for the
whole country.''

WATER TESTING PLAN MAY GET TEXAS OFF OF `BEACH BUM' LIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A plan to monitor water quality at popular
beaches could get Texas off of a national environmental
organization's list of places where swimmers aren't adequately
warned of health threats.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program is a ``good step,'' to getting off the Natural
Resources Defense Council's ``beach bum'' list, council spokeswoman
Sarah Chasis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions we would ask Texas is whether they have
comprehensive monitoring of beach water safety and whether they
alert the public when the monitoring shows that health standards
are exceeded,'' Chasis said. ``Another question would be what
health standards they are using.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Texas General Land Commissioner and Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro said the General Land Office is
beginning a program to monitor water quality at the state's 10
busiest beach areas five times a month.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the tests, which will look for bacteria from human
and animal wastes and other germs that can cause illness to exposed
swimmers, will be turned over to the Texas Department of Health and
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Chasis said the Natural Resources Defense Council is pleased at
Mauro's reaction to the council's July placement of Texas on a list
of states that fail to test beach areas for health safety.
</P>
<P>
   Critical to Texas improving its ratings in the environmental
group's 1999 national study of beach safety will be how quickly
officials manage to warn swimmers of potential health hazards,
Chasis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faster the turnaround, the better, because then you can
alert people at a time when the threat is still present,'' Chasis
said. ``There are places that have a 24-hour turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural Resources Defense Council executive director Alan
Metrick confirmed that Texas ended up on the ``beach bum'' list
mainly because it lacks any comprehensive water testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro maintained that the state does not have sewage pollution
problems like those in many other parts of the country, in part
because strong currents along the coast help keep waters clean. The
Natural Resources Defense Council noted that most sewage pollution
occurs in Texas bays rather than along barrier island island
recreational beaches.

LIFE IS UNFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is standard practice to justify Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's relentless pursuit of President Clinton and
the Supreme Court's whittling down of his executive powers as
necessary to prove that not even a president is above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Clinton himself would certainly agree that this is a
democracy, under which all men and women are supposed to be treated
equally in the eyes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, do we tolerate the legal favoritism that benefits
members of Congress, who may ultimately be asked to sit in judgment
of the president? We won't permit the president to be above the
law, but we allow Congress that rarefied status.
</P>
<P>
   This double standard is in part the fault of the Constitution,
which confers on members of Congress limited immunity from civil or
criminal action stemming from the performance of their legislative
duties. The idea is to protect legislators from potential punitive
executive or judicial action meant to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently did not occur to the Founding Fathers that the
executive branch might need safeguards against excessive political
intimidation as well. But they were operating long before Congress
created the abomination that the special counsel's office has
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders were thinking of the unhappy period in 16th and
17th century English history during which the Tudor and Stuart
monarchs hassled unsympathetic members of Parliament by hauling
them into court. To prevent a similar development in America, they
inserted the speech and debate clause in their great document to
reinforce the separation of powers among the three governmental
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Article I, Section 6 declares that members of Congress ``for any
speech or debate in either house ... shall not be questioned in any
other place.'' The Supreme Court has traditionally interpreted this
to mean members cannot be sued for inaccurate or libelous
statements made in debate on the floor of the respective chambers
or for views expressed during committee deliberations. The high
bench has also included congressional staffers under this
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, ruled in 1979 that freedom from liability
does not extend to statements made in press releases and
newsletters, which the court did not consider an integral part of
the congressional deliberative process. And while a legal inquiry
into the motivation for performing any legislative act is
protected, a probe is deemed okay if it looks into a specific
accusation of bribery rather than the legislative objective the
bribe was intended to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   This partial congressional immunity from legal liability
reflects the wise doctrine of separation of powers that was missing
when the Supreme Court ruled last year that a sitting president can
be sued in a private civil action. The court allowed the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit to go ahead on the weird notion that
it would not interfere with Clinton's ability to govern the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench was ridiculously wrong. For this stupidity, the
president and the country are paying a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has not been content to merely enjoy its
constitutional advantage. Our esteemed legislators have a habit of
helping themselves to other privileges that set them apart from the
rules that govern other mortals.
</P>
<P>
   Congress exempts itself, for instance, from the independent
counsel statute, which is written to initiate probes of potential
wrongdoing only in the executive branch. The appointment of an
outside investigator was meant to prevent a conflict of interest
that might result from a Justice Department investigation of fellow
Cabinet members or the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress is oblivious to its own conflicts of interest. It
insists that members suspected of ethical violations be handled
in-house by a committee of their peers. This is often a painful
process, hobbled by secrecy, delay and partisan pressure. Most
members view assignment to the House and Senate ethics committees
as akin to getting the plague.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, Congress finally got around to obeying 11
federal labor and anti-discrimination laws that it had imposed on
the rest of the country. House Republicans had pledged in their
1994 ``Contract With America'' to apply all laws equally to
Congress, ending the broad workplace exemption that members had
granted themselves for decades. The Republicans kept their word
when they took control of Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also fond of special perks, which are not available
to ordinary Americans. One of the most irritating is that members
of Congress enjoy free reserved parking slots at Ronald Reagan
National and Dulles International Airports here, while other fliers
must hunt for spaces in the overcrowded the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, however, members did give up the longtime
practice of having their city parking tickets fixed. How generous
of them.

 UNDATED: (Maslin.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,''  &LR; starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SMALL SOLDIERS,''  &LR; starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst,
Dennis Leary and Phil Hartman. Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105
minutes). This ably animated film about action-figure toys who
virtually come to life should have been a sure thing. There are
innocent echoes of ``Toy Story'' and darker ones of the director's
own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had the witty balance of mischief
and horror that ``Small Soldiers'' strangely lacks. The voice
talent here is extraordinary, with the casts of ``The Dirty Dozen''
and ``This Is Spinal Tap'' playing rival toy factions, and Tommy
Lee Jones and Frank Langella as their respective commanders. But
the story remains unfocused and grows too wan for horror, too
creepy for lighthearted fun. Another reason not to laugh is
Hartman's performance in the fatuous role that was his last
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE SPANISH PRISONER,''  &LR; starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,''  &LR; starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TITANIC,''  &LR; starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and
Gloria Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For
once, a much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious
throwback to the days when epic storytelling really filled the
screen. Despite the astonishing technological advances behind
Cameron's great visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to
intrude on the film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn
back into the Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful
voyage. For all its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic''
proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of
its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young
lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with historical
detail, Ms. Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry.
With his ``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to
dream of the impossible and came up with the movie of the year
(Maslin).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies playing this weekend. Ratings and running times
are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ARMAGEDDON,''  &LR;  starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler
and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes).
This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a
single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a
strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid)
becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and
a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real
courage. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason
that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries
gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window-dressing
at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises,
frequent explosions and bright computer-screen colors _ seem as
inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the
illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BASEKETBALL,''  &LR;  starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
Directed by David Zucker &UR;  &LR; (R, 105 minutes). In David Zucker's
funny, gross-out spoof of professional sports, Parker and Stone are
two hapless post-adolescent dudes (the latest variation on Wayne
and Garth) who invent a silly driveway hybrid of basketball and
baseball that becomes a national obsession. The film is essentially
two movies stuck together. One is a dumber-than-dumb teen-age
comedy crammed with farcical sight gags and raunchy adolescent
humor. The other is a no-holds-barred satire of professional sports
and the greed, egotism and pomposity surrounding them. As in his
``Naked Gun'' series, Zucker's comic strategy is to fire off a
machine-gun volley of jokes of all shapes and sizes, trusting that
enough will land to keep the audience on the edge of a giggle
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``DR. DOLITTLE,''  &LR; starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty
Thomas (PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the
animals, they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of
vocal talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from the
animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,''  &LR; starring Drew Barrymore,
Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant
(PG-13, 120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella
as a self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother
to get ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and
soap opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky,
resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows
how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince (Scott) isn't
much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick
Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ``Mona Lisa'' under his
arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from
the standard fairy tale is Anjelica Huston's haughty stepmother
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVEREST,''  &LR; directed by David Brashears with Greg
MacGillivray (not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City
doesn't provide enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a
vicarious near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax
Theater at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go
at ``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _
29,028 feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the 8-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of the team's
climb toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE GOVERNESS,''  &LR;  starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840's, and Rosina (Minnie Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic
Jewish woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``HENRY FOOL,''  &LR;  starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool (
Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim (
Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``HIGH ART,''  &LR;  starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell.
Directed by Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a
fierce, tricky performance in the role of a once-celebrated
photographer, spooked by fame, who long ago retreated from the art
world to live a reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This
steamily intense story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms.
Mitchell's bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a
desperately stylish photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's
seductive, powerfully atmospheric first feature explores their
relationship with intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any
hope of raw edges and real emotion to its own chic sensibility,
which proves so studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story.
Patricia Clarkson does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover,
a glamorously decadent German actress who never got past the
Fassbinder years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LETHAL WEAPON 4,''  &LR; starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and
Rene Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the
full perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this
turns out to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The
characters are funny and likable, and they all live on earth. The
formula still has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new
addition of Chris Rock as a young detective who has literally
married into the ``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with
breezy finesse. And the story, about slave smuggling and Chinese
gangsters, is a flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by
kidding camaraderie and constant forward motion. Bear in mind that
this is still a film whose idea of high drama is watching a car get
pushed in front of an oncoming train (Maslin).

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MAFIA!,''  &LR; starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges and Christina
Applegate. Directed by Jim Abrahams (PG-13, 86 minutes). This
sendup makes an offer you could probably refuse, but its
Mad-magazine-style hit-or-miss humor works well enough to be
reasonably bright. It's true, though, that a Mafia movie satire
without a single horse's head in a bed and without anyone who
sounds like Joe Pesci has left a few stones unturned. Concentrating
mostly on the ``Godfather'' films and ``Casino,'' Abrahams throws
in anything from canned meatballs by Spalding to vomit gags. Lloyd
Bridges, to whose memory the film is dedicated, has the role of a
dapper don and shows one last time how sporting and debonair he
could be (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MASK OF ZORRO,''  &LR; starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony
Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell
(PG-13, 130 minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling
was serious business, when boyish adventure films still had their
innocence and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a
movie needed in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously
game as the film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play
the aging hero's jokey, hotblooded protege. And he meets his match
in the story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as
``beyond compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should
appeal to older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly
touches (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MULAN,''  &LR;  with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and
B.D. Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86
minutes). Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender
stereotyping in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing
barrier but also ratchets up the violence level for children's
animation. This is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney
animated films, right down to the clowning sidekicks, would-be
``Under the Sea'' production number and Destiny ballad from the
intrepid heroine (``When will my reflection show who I am
inside?''). Murphy's very funny wisecracks make the character of a
little dragon entertaining, but this black-sounding character is
also treated as a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action
crowd scenes more often than it takes audiences to the realm of the
imagination (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE NEGOTIATOR,''  &LR; starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin
Spacey. Directed by F. Gary Gray (R, 115 minutes). In a twist on
the Hitchcockian maxim, this thriller takes two extraordinary
actors and places them in surprisingly ordinary circumstances. In a
film whose title should have been plural, both stars play seasoned
hostage negotiators who are caught up in a by-the-numbers battle of
wits. Amazingly, both these shrewd, maverick actors are cast as
nice guys, team players and clean-cut family men. The movie's
brisk, familiar look of a police story, heavy with close-ups, that
escalates to a paramilitary operation will look right at home when
it comes to the video screen (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,''  &LR; starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,''  &LR; starring Christina Ricci, Martin
Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100
minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully
acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from
nasty little Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil
twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this
film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart
of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally
skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``OUT OF SIGHT,''  &LR; starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PARENT TRAP,''  &LR; starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha
Richardson and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written
by David Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A
super-cute remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a
privileged shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride''
team of Ms. Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam
appealingly as parents who somehow managed to separate their twins
at birth without a twinge of guilt, and who seem to have spent all
of the intervening 11{ years shopping. In her dual role as English
and American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house, the
other on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine),
the spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been
taking shrinking-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).

CLINTON CALLS DYING TEEN WHO BECAME U.S. CITIZEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, touched by the story of
16-year-old Gimel Aguinaga's wish to become a U.S. citizen, called
the cancer-stricken Houston teen-ager Thursday to offer his best
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president called Gimel Aguinaga this afternoon at his
uncle's home and congratulated him on becoming a U.S. citizen,'' an
aide said. ``He told Gimel that he must be proud because his mother
and his sister also became citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the two spoke for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Aguinaga, a Nicaraguan immigrant, his mother and his 14-year-old
sister were sworn in as citizens Tuesday thanks to the Texas Gulf
Coast Make-a-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with
life-threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, contacted the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to help overcome a citizenship backlog that
has 2 million people on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age, the youth could only become a U.S. citizen
if his mother did. His mother, Blanca Sunsin, who speaks very
little English, had to study a citizenship test _ given in English
_ of 10 questions or more about U.S. history and government.
</P>
<P>
   Aguinaga was diagnosed two years ago with bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was thrilled. He also was very proud that this
young man chose citizenship as one of his last wishes,'' the aide
said.

 `SAFE MEN': LOW-ENERGY SAFECRACKERS AND GANGSTER WANNABES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.)

<P>
   There's a difference between foolish and funny.
</P>
<P>
   People in silly situations aren't necessarily wellsprings of
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   By mistaking foolish for funny and silly for hilarious, the new
movie ``Safe Men'' comes a cropper.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it stands revealed as a low-energy comedy with
sufficient signs of willingness to stray off the beaten track to
indicate that somewhere down the line its writer and director, John
Hamburg, will create something far better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Men'' tells the story of Sam and Eddie (Sam Rockwell and
Steve Zahn), two losers in Providence, R.I. For five years, they
have been trying without success to establish themselves as singing
musicians, but Sam can't remember the lyrics and they cannot even
manage to entertain the members of the Pulaski Association.
</P>
<P>
   En route home from their latest failure, they are mistaken in a
bar for Frank and Mitchell (Mark Ruffalo and Josh Pais), a couple
of flawless local safecrackers who seem to have studied small talk
and fast food with Quentin Tarantino. Soon Sam and Eddie are conned
into picking up an easy $300,000 from an ailing old man's safe, but
the job is really only a ruse to put them in thrall to Big Fat
Bernie Gayle (Michael Lerner), the fatherly and ferocious local mob
boss.
</P>
<P>
   To save their lives, the inept Sam and Eddie are ordered to pull
off a few jobs, while Bernie prepares his hockey-loving son, Bernie
Jr. (Michael Schmidt), for his lavish bar mitzvah. One of the
safecracking assignments introduces Sam to Hannah (Christina Kirk),
who is not only the daughter of Providence's other big crook, Good
Stuff Leo, a fence played by Harvey Fierstein, but also the
ex-girlfriend of Frank, who is eager to return to her good graces.
</P>
<P>
   Though its sight gags include an ice sculpture of the Stanley
Cup and a yarmulke embroidered with the emblem of the New York
Rangers, ``Safe Men'' is far longer on dull talk than inventively
comic action. And the hangdog Sam and Eddie, central to the plot,
lack the wattage to light up the proceedings.
</P>
<P>

 Thomas Mallon's most recent book is the novel ``Dewey Defeats
Truman''  
 By THOMAS MALLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I come here these days, it's usually from
Connecticut, by way of Grand Central. The terminal's newly restored
ceiling, which played a crucial part in one of my novels, delights
the eye, but its sudden absence of grime brings to mind not so much
the ceiling's Beaux-Arts infancy as the spanking prosperity of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Once arrived, I'm off to the Madison Avenue building of Conde
Nast, whose magazines will soon move to a Disneyfied Times Square;
or to the New York Public Library, where even the lions have been
wearing hard hats; or down to the Strand bookstore, two blocks
south of Union Square, whose continuing glamorization would give an
anarchist spasms.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often I need to go see my paperback publisher in
the Flatiron Building, situated where Fifth Avenue meets Broadway.
Those last five words sound like a marketer's dream slogan, a
one-two punch of wealth and dazzle, but they also define an actual
crossroads, the nexus that occurs at 23rd Street, these days a
relatively humble haven in a city undergoing too much gleaming
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Flatiron's northern offices look out on Madison Square Park,
whose six acres stretch east toward Madison Avenue and north to
26th Street. The men and women who walk here are an unassuming lot,
less the cell-phoned swells of the new Bryant Park than
nine-to-fivers needing a smoke. The benches still fill up with men
killing time and, however slowly, themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reseeding, the grass remains patchy, and the officially
designated ``Squirrel House'' (a hollow dead tree) is ignored by
its intended guests, scavengers with no time for cute.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison Square Park also offers the visitor a small
perpetuation of New York between the mid-19th and early 20th
centuries, a long period when the state and the city supplied the
country with some of its grandest political personalities. Several
of ``my'' men, minor and major characters in the historical fiction
I've been writing, are frozen stiff here.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the park's southwest entrance is William H. Seward,
New York's governor and U.S senator before being made secretary of
state by Abraham Lincoln, with whom he nearly died on April 14,
1865. He sits casually, legs crossed, looking away from the state
paper that rests on an arm of his chair. This is the Seward who
bought Alaska for a song, serenely redeemed for his folly, enjoying
an eternal I-told-you-so.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the park's western boundary, a triangular traffic
island supports the obelisk commemorating Maj. Gen. William Jenkins
Worth's triumphant 1847 entry into Mexico City. Like Seward's
statue, it's been recently restored, but one has to wonder about
its presence in an increasingly Hispanic city, and whether the
general may one day have to content himself with Fort Worth, Texas,
as his big American monument.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive memorial inside the park, in its northeast
portion, belongs to Adm. David Farragut, to whom New York City gave
$50,000 to buy a home after his Civil War successes. The pedestal
to this early Saint-Gaudens masterpiece, a sort of swirling
triptych with two curving flanks, seems lighter and more animate
than the statue it supports.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Farragut, looking well attired but rather surprised to be
here at all, stands Chester A. Arthur, who became the country's
21st president upon the assassination of James A. Garfield in 1881.
The mutton-chopped and always fashionable Arthur (he had Louis
Comfort Tiffany help him redecorate the White House) appears to
have just risen from the chair behind him, summoned by history to a
task he performed rather better than most imagined he would.
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties about him had everything to do with the park's
remaining statue, that of the ever choleric Sen. Roscoe Conkling,
who has stood since 1893 as a sort of Cerberus near the southeast
entrance. The absolute boss of the New York Republican Party in the
1870s, Conkling quite simply owned the pre-presidential Arthur, who
as the port collector of New York watched over the Custom House,
the mightiest patronage engine in the country. Neither man suffered
from any of our recent confusion about just what constitutes
soliciting campaign contributions on federal property: kickbacks
were sometimes rendered at an office on Hanover _ dubbed
``Hand-Over'' _ Street.
</P>
<P>
   A gorgeous brute of a man _ casually cruel, unforgiving, an
orator who made his colleagues tremble and the galleries swoon _
Conkling looks absolutely certain of his right to be immortalized
in the park. In fact, he is in midspeech, his left hand at his hip,
his right one open at his side. He's sure he'll convince you, of
whatever it is, before you take another step.
</P>
<P>
   The living Conkling, with his blond forelock, violet ink,
bedazzled mistresses and lapses into statesmanship, is a historical
novelist's dream. I've written about two-thirds of the book he
marauds through, and when passing Madison Square I sometimes feel a
literal version of the satisfaction that Virginia Woolf expressed
to her diary when things were going well with her novel ``The
Waves'': ``I think it possible that I have got my statues against
the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   I still keep an apartment in the city, close to the United
Nations, whose abstract outdoor sculpture leaves me either bored or
suspicious _ so many noble sentiments springing from such dubious
donors. The one modern sculpture in Madison Square Park _ three
rectangular oblongs by Antoni Milkowski _ merely perplexes me. This
is my limitation, to be sure; but my mind, so drawn to replication,
is more akin to that of the 19th-century New Yorker, whose zeal for
statuary eventually got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Park and the People,'' their 1992 history of Central
Park, Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar note how ``in 1873 the
park board acted to restrict commemorative sculpture to the Mall
and the entrance gates and to require prior review of artistic
merit.'' But the review committee of artistic experts had only
advisory powers and often could not resist ``the pressure to
commemorate immensely popular figures.'' Only when the five
boroughs amalgamated themselves at the end of the century into the
current City of New York did an Art Commission of experts supersede
the park board and stop the proliferation of pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   It was this modern, swelling city that made Conkling and Arthur
obsolete. In fact, all the figures in Madison Square were set up to
face south in a city rushing north. The great edifice that has
dominated the square in this century, Napoleon LeBrun's
Metropolitan Life building (1910), towers over the park's forgotten
men, a sort of architectural memento mori, reminding the passer-by
that one can insure one's life but not one's name.

 &HT;    Former AA member criticizes organization in new book
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marianne Gilliam does not have a degree in medicine or
psychology, but she considers herself an expert on addiction. One
of three children in a middle-class family in Cobb County(Ga.), she
took her first drink at 14.
</P>
<P>
   By age 18, she was one of 14 million alcoholics in America, and
she had slid into drug addiction and bulimia as well. While her
classmates packed for college, Gilliam headed for the meeting halls
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Then she tried Overeaters Anonymous, treatment centers and
special camps. Nothing worked. Especially Alcoholics Anonymous, she
says. After a few months it seemed to Gilliam that the 12-step
approach perpetuated addiction by replacing dependence on alcohol
and drugs with a dependence on the program itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although some members eventually stopped drinking,'' she says,
``many did not address the underlying problems that drove them to
drink in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning AA, Gilliam took a more individualistic approach to
solving her problems. Now clean and sober for four years, the
34-year-old mother of two has written a first-person account of her
successful recovery that harshly criticizes an organization that
for more than 60 years has helped millions on the road to sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so effective, why is the rate of relapse among AA
members nearly 70 percent?'' Gilliam asks in ``How Alcoholics
Anonymous Failed Me: My Personal Journey to Sobriety Through
Self-Empowerment'' (Eagle Brook/Morrow, $22).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people who drop out of AA, I thought this
book would be useful to them. Since I found a way to overcome
addictions myself, maybe that would encourage them to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AA said the organization doesn't respond to
comments or criticism, but an addiction expert at Emory
University(Ga.) says that relapses do not necessarily mean the
treatment is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you relapse, I think there's improvement,'' says
Dr. Michael Kuhar, chief of the neuroscience division at Yerkes
Primate Center and president-elect of the College on Problems of
Drug Dependence. ``Different things work for different people. It's
not that there's something wrong with the treatment, it's just that
people are so different. Nothing helps everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the conclusion Gilliam reached. ``Recovery is not a
one-size-fits-all proposition,'' she says. ``If AA works for you,
that's great. If it doesn't, there are alternative courses of
treatment. AA didn't work for me because AA's focus on character
defects and shortcomings kept me from discovering what was right
and beautiful about myself. For someone who doesn't have much
self-esteem to begin with, it's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Until she decided to fight her demons alone, Gilliam's life had
been a blur of booze and parties, first at Emory and later when she
began working as a stockbroker in Atlanta. Every night she would
hit the bars to drink and score lines of cocaine. When she finally
hit bottom, she moved back in with her parents and sought help. A
month shy of her one-year anniversary at AA, however, she got drunk
and used cocaine again. And all the while she was bingeing and
purging three or four times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the experts wanted to let me off the hook,'' she says.
``Some said it was a disease over which I was powerless. Psychology
experts told me I had a wounded inner child within and that my
behavior was a result of a dysfunctional family. Nobody wanted me
to take responsibility for my actions.'' When Gilliam decided she
would have to save herself, she moved into a small apartment and
used her MBA training to set up an import-export consulting
business. Much of her time, however, she spent at bookstores,
browsing through Deepak Chopra's ``Overcoming Addictions'' and
other self-help books. What she found convinced her that the root
of her problem stemmed from a lack of self-esteem that began in
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My food issues seemed to center around my searching for love
and comfort, perhaps the love and comfort I had been longing for
from my father and had never received,'' she says. ``He was always
there physically and materially for the family, but emotionally I
felt as if I had never gotten his approval or respect. By reading
self-help books and seeing a good therapist, I slowly learned to
accept my father just the way he was. When I was able to recognize
that, I was able to begin the psychological healing that in turn
led to physical healing and freedom from addictive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   She quickly adds that one of the keys to her recovery was her
family's unconditional support. ``They were always there for me, no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam's book has been praised by Dr. Bernie S. Siegel, author
of ``Love, Medicine and Miracles,'' and other proponents of
self-empowerment. And now that she is clean and sober, Gilliam is
looking for ways to help others find the right path. When she spoke
recently at a Unity church, several women came up to her afterward,
related similar experiences and asked for her guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them there is hope,'' she says. ``My book may not have
all the answers, but perhaps it can set them on the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   What worked for Gilliam may not work for everyone, Kuhar
cautions. ``Some people need more structure. This woman has a high
degree of motivation and intelligence. She could sit down and
figure out what was wrong. She's a gifted person who was able to
solve her problems. Unfortunately, everybody is not that smart or
that dedicated.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: The challenges of rethinking Marx are made manifest
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowhere does it seem more dated, less relevant, than in its
famous opening sentence. ``A specter is haunting Europe _ the
specter of Communism,'' its youthfully optimistic authors wrote in
1848. Whatever may haunt Europe today, it is not communism.
</P>
<P>
   The political movement that paid homage to Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels is as dead as the divine right of kings. And yet
``The Communist Manifesto'' not only remains in print but has been
dressed up in a 150th-anniversary edition.
</P>
<P>
   More than one, in fact. Oxford University Press has issued, in
its Classics series, a $5.95 paperback with a lucid introduction by
David McLellan. In Verso's $11 hardback edition, Marxist historian
Eric Hobsbawm traces the manifesto's origins as a pamphlet and
tries to wring from its denunciatory rhetoric a moral vision that
survives the heat of a moment long since passed.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto comes to mind not because of its 150th anniversary
_ I had quite forgotten _ but because of a letter from a reader.
All columnists have their faithful readers, and for every columnist
a special few occupy places of honor. It would embarrass this
particular reader to have me offer a testimonial to his wit and
acuity, so I am honoring his request _ I should say his cringing
plea _ not to be identified. It's enough to say that he took
exception to a column in which I mentioned Karl Marx and John
Stuart Mill in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know you value Marx as a first-rate intellect and a
brilliant writer,'' his letter tells me, ``but in your role as
Gadfly-in-Chief, you have to be more careful not to give succor to
the very objects of your criticism by even remotely hinting at a
species of equivalency between Marx and somebody like John Stuart
Mill.''
</P>
<P>
   A social philosopher's bankrupt ideas
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to detail the many and familiar ways in which
``Marx's key ideas crumple like buildings at ground zero.'' Marx
was wrong, he reminds me, on every count: his view of society, his
materialistic interpretation of history, his understanding of
economics. Besides which, ``Marx was a killer,'' a man in whose
name millions in our century would be sent to gulags or
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose this can be read, then, as a brief in behalf of a
monster. I'd ask that we all give Karl the Killer a hand _ Fred,
too _ but it would sound facetious and insincere. A better way of
appreciating, or at least understanding, Marx's legacy would be to
re-read David Denby's exhilarating ``Great Books: My Adventures
With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf and Other Indestructible Writers of the
Western World.''
</P>
<P>
   Published two years ago, Denby's book is a film critic's account
of returning to Columbia University 30 years after he graduated and
taking the required humanities courses he had taken as an
18-year-old. It was a brilliant idea, and not just for a book. What
Denby realized is that we read a great book differently at 48 than
we read it at 18 _ life has a way of altering, usually deepening,
our view of things.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Marx, Denby could see easily enough the errors
and misapprehensions, not just in ``The Communist Manifesto'' but
also in the richer works he published before and after. Yet he came
to see in Marx something else:
</P>
<P>
   ``We work for others, to fulfill other people's goals, and often
enough we confront what we produce with an indifference bordering
on disgust. And so the eternal cry of boredom and meaninglessness;
the impoverishment that so many feel, the hollow exhaustion at the
end of the day; the dull anger, the internal distancing of oneself,
the need to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   `An arena of anxiety and triumph'
</P>
<P>
   Reading Marx anew, Denby understood better a psychological
debilitation that afflicts so many Americans, professionals as well
as wage earners: ``They drag themselves through work to reach the
promised land of leisure, the ecstasy of the defining car, suit,
house or vacation that settles for all time who they are. The
disgust with work makes the act of buying things an arena of
anxiety and triumph. Alienation exists at all levels of American
life. It is called consumerism.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is reading a little bit into Marx, it's not reading
much. You'll find no evidence for it in the three dry volumes of
``Das Kapital'' and you must search hard for it in even ``The
Communist Manifesto.'' But it's scattered about in an assortment of
earlier writings, most of them collected in various editions. One
of the handiest is Viking's ``The Portable Karl Marx.'' The
manifesto is there and so is a telling self-analysis. In a parlor
game Marx's daughters Jenny and Laura put to him a series of
questions. Asked his idea of happiness, he answered, ``To fight.''
Asked his chief characteristic, he answered, ``Singleness of
purpose.'' Asked his favorite virtue in a woman, he answered,
``Weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   So he wasn't perfect. Yet he was loved by his wife and by his
four daughters, if by few others. In our day he is revered only by
academics for whom he would have the bitterest contempt. It might
surprise my friend in Roswell that he and Karl have that, if
nothing else, in common. He might even wish to bow his head,
repentant.

   While other people sleep, sleuths take a different view of
night. For them, night is when the mind paces the floor, when the
menace to home and hearth overwhelms, when, says fictional
investigator Sharon McCone, ``the threat always comes from
within.'' SS Even if detectives doze off, they cannot rest, for
dreams, McCone muses, ``often carry messages from the subconscious
that, if properly interpreted, can serve us well.'' SS In
mysteries, nightmares embody a fear of powerlessness. Psychological
invasion, frequently accompanied by criminal intrusion into the
sleuth's home, assaults identity. SS Engrossed in a case,
investigators become insomniacs or are so denied sleep that lines
blur between good and evil, sanity and insanity, real and dreamed.
SS Today's whodunit interrogates those borders more than the usual
suspects.

   -- While Other People Sleep. By Marcia Muller. Mysterious Press.
$23. 344 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Life for San Francisco private investigator Sharon McCone turns
into her worst nightmare: A stalker is impersonating her. Her
double breaks into McCone's apartment, stealing financial and
personal information. Since the impersonator sleeps around,
McCone's reputation takes a bigger hit than her credit cards. Using
an expert who relates fascinating facts about stalkers, McCone
solves the puzzle of who is after her identity and why. But by the
end of this honed meditation on stalking, she can only hope that in
time she'll ``let go of this nightmare.'' The ``habit of fear,''
McCone implies, will linger in ``every creak of the floorboards.''

   -- Tanner on Ice. By Lawrence Block. Dutton. $23.95. 248 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence agent Evan Tanner was robbed of his ability to
sleep after shrapnel invaded his skull during the Korean War. He
lived ``twenty-four wide-awake hours a day'' as a spy-adventurer
until Lawrence Block retired his character 25 years ago. Now,
Tanner is back. It seems a Scandinavian spy froze him cryonically
in 1972. His body was discovered and resurrected, and though he has
not aged, the century has. Nixon is no longer president; computers
and faxes are mysteries; and Minna, his former 11-old-charge, is
now 36, only a few years younger than he is. For six months, Tanner
speed-reads 25 years of Time and Newsweek day and, of course,
night, catching up on events. Then his old boss, now in his 90s,
shows up, and Tanner is off to Burma, which became Myanmar as he
slept, on an assassination assignment. While the first half of this
modern-day Rip Van Winkle tale is ingenious, the plot thereafter is
watered-down James Bond. But Block's acerbic commentary keeps you
reading.

   -- The Pied Piper. By Ridley Pearson. Hyperion. $23.95. 497
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad enough for police detective Lou Boldt: As his
hospitalized wife battles cancer, he cares for their two children.
But when the Pied Piper, a West Coast serial kidnapper who snatches
babies from their homes, moves into the Seattle area, Boldt's life
runs on coffee. As he and colleagues work with (and in spite of)
the FBI to capture the kidnapper, they encounter scam artists, drug
dealers and online hackers. When his own toddler is snatched and
the kidnapper demands that the search be stymied, Boldt must decide
whether to save his daughter or his integrity. For days, he walks
the tightrope between honor and dishonor, and ``couldn't nap even
if he'd been awake a week.'' Even after the case is closed, Boldt
finds himself haunted by the sound of children sobbing. Ridley
Pearson's rich prose is as caffeinated as his detective in this
nonstop read.

<P>
   -- Death Row. By Jon Katz. Doubleday. $21.95. 228 pages.
</P>
<P>
   A family's welfare is also at stake in this newest mystery in
Jon Katz's suburb series. Private eye Kit DeLeeuw is busy taking
care of his job, the kids and car pools while wife Jane gets a
psychology degree. Then his elderly friend Benchley Carrolton winds
up in an overly guarded nursing home. When Kit manages to get into
the place, overseen by a version of Nurse Ratched and owned by a
state senator who issues threats, he decides his friend's life is
in danger. Kit kidnaps Benchley and persuades the state cops to set
up a sting. Lying awake the night before, he muses that ``this
wasn't really a plan. It was a giant crapshoot, with my career, my
reputation, and my family's financial security riding on the
outcome.'' Kit's sense of good is unerring, as is Katz's humorous
portrait of the suburbs. But the powerlessness of the elderly ill
is poignantly and seriously rendered.

   -- Moon Music. By Faye Kellerman. Morrow. $25.50. 424 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who likes mysteries salted with the Gothic will eat up
this tale of an obsessive compulsive turned cannibal. Women's
mauled bodies show up in the Las Vegas desert, and police Sgt. Rom
Poe investigates. Darned if some of the victims weren't lovers to
his colleague Steve Jensen, married to Poe's disturbed high school
love. Readers will quickly figure out who done it; Faye Kellerman
is more interested in why. This tour through the Vegas underworld
dispenses as much blood as the Red Cross, and the plot traverses a
long-ago suicide, A-bomb tests, a diamondback rattler and, uh,
werewolves. Poe's personal life is as diffuse as the action. His
twin brother commits their alcoholic mother to Rom's care, just as
Rom reaches a crisis in his relationship with a pathologist. Love
in Vegas has worse odds than roulette. After the crime is solved,
Rom is jolted from a nightmare. His house jerks, a water bottle
flies. Was it an earthquake? Or are ghouls for real? Place your
bets.

   -- Murder at the Watergate. By Margaret Truman. Random House.
$25. 333 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The milieu only seems more civilized in Washington. Law
professor Mackensie Smith and wife Annabel move to the Watergate,
home of presidential campaign headquarters for their friend Vice
President Joe Aprile. More than his Boss, the veep disapproves of
the drug policy of Mexico's ruling PRI government. When two Mexican
nationals with damning information about the PRI turn up dead,
Aprile's assistant asks Mac to contact a guerrilla leader in San
Miguel de Allende. But betrayal is at work on both sides of the
border, and Annabel dreams that a hairy, swirling mass rips Mac
from her. When the couple is endangered after the Mexican
elections, evidence points to a U.S. traitor. Margaret Truman's
inside knowledge adds to the crisp plot, and her portrait of
Capitol people, particularly hostess Elfie Dorrance, is superb. Who
can you trust? In D.C. politics, there's no way to know.
</P>
<P>
   -- Acts of Murder. By Laurali R. Wright. Scribner. $22. 278
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The murderers are more interesting than the sleuths in this
exploration of sociopathology by an Edgar Award-winning British
Columbian. A cleaning woman, long ago jilted by her husband,
interprets a dream about a snake as a message to continue her
serial killings. Determined to sweep the world of people she
perceives to be sinners, Mrs. O'Hara knocks off several citizens of
Sechelt. Meanwhile, one of her clients conks her adulterous husband
over the head with a cast-iron frying pan and, believing him dead,
hides his body. Investigator Karl Alberg seems strangely removed
from the investigations. He's just married Cassandra Mitchell, is
rethinking his career and has a new female sergeant, who is being
harassed by an old boyfriend. This finely drawn anatomy of marriage
shows how domestic anger can segue into murderous rage, how love
turns into a snake that eats its own tail, how everyday life trips
over the edge into nightmare.

 &HT;    Murder, Marilyn and a Movie: Author spins `Crazy' tales of
celebrity
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was four years ago that Mark Childress met Marilyn Monroe on
a Costa Rica beach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, it wasn't really the legendary actress, but the
woman looked like Monroe would have looked if she had not died and
were 15 years older. The resemblance was so striking, in fact, that
Childress kicked his imagination in gear and came up with the idea
for a novel.
</P>
<P>
   What if Monroe were still alive on some remote island? And what
if she were sharing the island with Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa and
a bunch of other ``dead'' celebrities? And what if a '70s rock
star, say someone such as Jim Croce, crash-landed there?
</P>
<P>
   The premise for ``Gone for Good'' (Knopf, $25) would be too
far-fetched for many writers to even attempt, but not Childress. He
is, after all, the author of ``Crazy in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   In that 1993 novel, Childress spins an outrageous tale of a
Southern woman who cuts off her husband's head, stashes it in a
Tupperware lettuce keeper and sets out to seek fame and fortune in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way she periodically ``burps'' the Tupperware and
checks its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two novels are worlds apart, both deal with
celebrity, a subject Childress finds fascinating. ``It's the
scourge and religion of our age,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Alabama native didn't object to hanging out with
movie stars Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith in Houma, La.,
for the past three months. Banderas is directing the film version
of ``Crazy in Alabama,'' starring Griffith as the wacky Alabama
beauty. Childress, 40, a former regional editor for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, wrote the screenplay and acted as unofficial
adviser. The film is scheduled for release in spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got involved with the movie, I realized that a lot of
the things I was thinking about celebrity were confirmed,''
Childress says. ``These people have paper shredders in their houses
so people won't go through their garbage and read their mail.
People think that celebrities are their property.''
</P>
<P>
   Paparazzi were not exactly a problem in Houma, though. The main
challenge was finding entertainment in the small southeastern
Louisiana town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a water-slide park and one good restaurant where we
hung out,'' Childress says. ``But it's just as well. We had a
shooting schedule of 15 hours a day. After that, all we wanted to
do was go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith and Don Johnson bought the film rights to ``Crazy in
Alabama'' several years ago when they were still married. After the
divorce, Johnson shopped the script around without success. When
Griffith heard it was available again, she bought it for Banderas'
first directing project.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Houma Courier, Banderas said the
opportunity to re-create America in the 1960s was appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same movie,'' Banderas said, ``we go from black comedy
to political drama to almost a horror movie sometimes. It's just
trying to balance all that stuff together _ to link them together _
to see how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   One thread of the story follows Lucille (Griffith), who kills
her abusive husband, leaves her seven kids with her mother and
heads for California to be a star on the TV show ``Bewitched.'' At
the same time, there is a parallel story dealing with Lucille's
nephew, Peejoe (played by Lucas Black of ``Slingblade''), who
becomes embroiled in a civil rights struggle over the integration
of a public swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Houma was picked because it resembled Alabama but was close
enough to New Orleans to use local film crews. The film has a
relatively modest $15 million budget but a big-name cast:
Griffith's co-stars include Elizabeth Perkins, Rod Steiger, Robert
Wagner and Meat Loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, screenwriters are rarely seen or heard on the set,
but Childress says Banderas asked him for help on nearly every
take. ``Some of my suggestions he took, some of them he didn't. But
he was very concerned about getting everything right, especially
the accents.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the accents were too good. ``In one scene, Lucas Black
was supposed to say, `You didn't even ask.' Instead, it came out,
`Youdinteenask.' I understood it, but nobody who wasn't from
Alabama did.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress, who resembles a pudgy cherub with blond-streaked
hair, has kept his Alabama accent despite leaving his home state
years ago. After a stint in San Francisco, he moved to Costa Rica
and built a small house on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Childress began vacationing in the Central American country
after one of his best friends died of AIDS and author Randy Shilts
(``And the Band Played On'') recommended it as a good place to
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the most beautiful place in the world,''
Childress says. ``The vacations kept getting longer and longer, so
I decided to build there. Costa Rica is paradise with chickens in
the street. It reminds me of the Alabama of my childhood _ a bit
shabby and undeveloped but very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress has been possessed by the writing bug since he was a
child in Monroeville, Ala., the hometown of Truman Capote and
Harper Lee. ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' was the first adult book he
remembers reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Monroeville had read it because that's where it's
set,'' he says, ``so I always had the sense that fiction is born
out of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta writer Charles McNair recalls meeting Childress in
author Barry Hannah's class at the University of Alabama. ``After
class, we'd get in my pickup truck and ride around, dreaming of the
days we'd become published writers like Flannery O'Connor. He was
precocious even then. He won the Thomas Wolfe Award for the most
promising fiction writer.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student of Hannah's, Childress studied the works of Latin
American writers and became enthralled with the concept of
supernatural intervention in human life, an approach he used in his
debut novel, ``A World Made of Fire'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   After working as a journalist for Southern Living and The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he quit in 1986 to write fiction full
time. He honed his storytelling craft in ```V' for Victor'' (1988),
an adventure story about a young boy and German submarines off the
coast of Alabama, and ``Tender'' (1990), a fictionalized version of
Elvis Presley's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he writes a book he intends to write something
different from before,'' McNair says. ``You can't depend on getting
a sort of John Grisham-like formulaic approach. When you get a book
that hits the nerve of American culture the way `Crazy in Alabama'
did, and the next book is not even about the USA, it throws
predictability to the wind. That's problematic for some readers and
critics who want formula.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true for ``Gone for Good,'' which has received wildly
mixed reviews. Childress admits the bad reviews bother him, but he
also has learned to put them in perspective. ``One paper ran a
review that said this book was not as good as the classic `Crazy in
Alabama,' which the paper hated when it was published.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' was Childress' first attempt at
screenwriting, and although it was painful cutting a 500-page
manuscript to 110 pages, he is satisfied with the results. The
script captures the spirit of the novel, he says, even if some
details had to be changed. The Tupperware lettuce holder used to
transport the severed head, for example, had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company wouldn't let us use it in the movie,'' he says,
``so we had to make it a (generic) plastic container. I can't
imagine why they would object. ...''

WALKER EVANS PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: 3 DEGREES OF SEPARATION ON THE
ROAD TO ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't have to read Walter Benjamin to understand
the laws of mechanical reproduction. Anyone who has ever used a
Xerox machine knows that images reproduced time and again degrade
and change. The grays dissolve and eventually the subtle features
of the image disappear. At the same time, the aura, the authentic
atmosphere around the original object, vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking
in one element: its presence in time and space,'' Benjamin, the
German philosopher and critic, wrote. ``The presence of the
original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker Evans: Murals From the 1971 MOMA Retrospective,'' at
the Laurence Miller Gallery, is arguably not a show of Walker
Evans' photographs, despite the title of the exhibition. It is a
show of some blowups of Evans' photographs that were printed from
his negatives as part of the wall decoration for his retrospective
at the Museum of Modern Art 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These mural-size pictures have neither the stinging clarity nor
the melancholy aura of the originals. But they do offer something
else: a chance to ponder how radically images can change depending
on how, when and why they are reproduced. In the case of Evans,
this exercise proves rewarding, for, as Gilles Mora and John T.
Hill observe in ``Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye,'' Evans himself was
fascinated by ``the consumer image, multiplied by the media.'' In
the 1930s, he photographed hundreds of billboards, signs and
posters throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, five of the six pictures on display at Laurence
Miller are blowups of some of Evans' best known pictures of
commercial objects: a torn movie poster, a shrimp fisherman's house
in Biloxi, Miss., full of mass-produced images of the Virgin Mary,
a shoe-shine sign, a billboard advertising a furniture business and
the window display of a cheap photo studio. (The sixth photograph
is of a Southern church.) Each picture is not only a study of
commercial imagery but also a many-layered meditation on the
vicissitudes of mechanical reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1936, the very year Benjamin published his essay
``The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,'' Evans
took a photograph he called ``Penny Picture Display.'' The
photograph showed an array of tiny portrait photos with the letters
s-t-u-d-i-o printed over it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, these portraits were originally intended as mementos
or perhaps identification photos. But when the studio put them up
for display as an advertisement, their function and even their look
changed. Each picture ceded its individuality to the commercial
demands of the group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, when Evans took his picture of the studio's window
display, the meaning of the portraits changed yet again. Evans'
purpose, after all, was not to get more business for the studio. He
was taking a slice of American life during the Depression. And he
succeeded so well that John Szarkowski, the curator of the 1971
show, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to know now with certainty whether Evans
recorded the America of his youth or invented it. Beyond doubt, the
accepted myth of our recent past is in some measure the creation of
this photographer . . . It is now part of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   The many levels of visual interest and intention in Evans'
picture of pictures naturally direct our attention to the Miller
gallery's version of the same picture. Is the blowup of this
photograph so different from the picture Evans took? Sure it is.
</P>
<P>
   It was not printed by Walker Evans. It was produced by the
Modernage Laboratory in Manhattan as a graphic element in the 1971
retrospective, one of the 13 blowups that punctuated the exhibition
of 200 photographs. Because it is 6 by 8 feet, it is far grainier
than the original. And it has a different claim to fame. Its air of
authenticity does not derive from a direct connection with Evans
but rather from the Evans retrospective. It is a relic from that
event, and it is now on sale for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is not such a bad thing. Benjamin said that the
whole idea of ``authentic'' photographic prints was senseless
anyway, since all prints are reproductions. He also thought there
was something good about killing an art object's air of
authenticity, its aura. Once the aura is destroyed, he hoped, so is
the elitist attitude toward art. There was, however, one danger:
that the aura of an object would be replaced by a new kind of aura,
which he called ``the phony spell of a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Evans have thought?
</P>
<P>
   His approach to American commercialism suggests he might have
been intrigued by the show. His picture of a torn movie poster is
shot in such a way that one of the movie stars appears to be
horrified not by the events in the movie but by the rip that runs
from the crown of her head to her chin.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of twist is evident in Evans' 1936 photograph of
the furniture advertisement near Birmingham, Ala. The left half has
a picture of a landscape with river and trees and text that reads:
``Did You Know? J.W. McDonald Furn. Co. Can Furnish Your Home
Complete. Congoleum Rugs. Gruno Refrigerators.'' The right part of
the advertisement shows a primitive painting of a happily furnished
home: two women sitting on a couch and talking while two children
play on a nearby rug.
</P>
<P>
   But when Evans took the picture of the billboard he changed our
view of it. In his photograph he included not only the billboard
itself but also its wooden legs, the leafy ground under it and the
hint of houses on either side of it. Indeed, the bucolic part of
the billboard seems to be mocked by the ground it stands on. The
subject was no longer what was IN the billboard, a furnished home,
but the billboard itself, an icon in the American landscape. Once
again, Evans seems to have located a rift in the illusory world of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   You could say he was an ironist. ``Walker Evans: The Hungry
Eye'' suggests he was a precursor of Pop Art and post-modernism
because he used commercial images for his own purposes: ``By
incorporating these images within his own and making them his own,
he was initiating a new esthetic act, close to that of Marcel
Duchamp, and prefiguring the wholesale reclamations of Pop Art and
ironic quotations of post-modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too much to suggest that Evans, like Duchamp, wanted to
attack the very idea of authenticity. Still, he might have been
more amused than appalled that blowups of his photographs of
posters, billboards and displays had themselves been turned into
salable art objects, for this adds yet another level of commercial
irony to his pictures. They are advertisements become photographs
become posters become art.

 &HT;    Designer aims for top of hip-hop wear heap
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having peeped mistakes made by his predecessors in the hip-hop
sportswear game, Fubu (``For us, by us'') founder Daymond John
isn't likely to repeat them.
</P>
<P>
   Black-owned urban sportswear firms that nibble at the edges of
the market segment's multibillion dollar pie come and go.
</P>
<P>
   Before John _ who's not yet 30 _ finishes his run, he thinks he
will have taken a big bite of that hip-hop couture pie.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the brothers (Thomas Walker and Carl Jones) who
brought you the carnival-colored Cross Colours collections back in
the 1980s thought similarly before their primary client _ the
Merry-Go-Round stores _ tanked and took them down, too. And if Karl
Kani ever thought his streetwear fortunes would continually rise,
he's had to reconsider the notion now that his once-indelible
imprint has started to fade.
</P>
<P>
   John, a native of Queens, N.Y., who operates out of a 66th-floor
Empire State Building suite, formed Fubu six years ago along with
three childhood friends. Though the shortest (5 feet, 7 inches)
member of his crew, John was its catalyst: He started the
sportswear line after being outraged when he was charged $20 for a
street-peddled rag that he could make for himself for mere pennies.
</P>
<P>
   John's bio progresses, loosely, as follows: Red Lobster waiter
sells his homemade caps on Queens street corners and plows the
profits into more bargain bolts of fabric for caps as well as logo
sweat shirts and T-shirts. The designer formerly-known-as a waiter
gets his mom to borrow $100,000 against her mortgage on her house
to get Fubu up and running. Somehow, Fubu sportswear winds up in
the hands of rapper LL Cool J, who hands John the free publicity
coup of all time by wearing a Fubu cap in a commercial produced and
aired repeatedly by the Gap. A Korean conglomerate happens along
and offers John sufficient financing and distribution support to
make and sell enough Fubu gear to stretch from Flatbush to Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Samsung) doesn't care if I'm selling Fubu on the street or on
Fifth Avenue as long as it's selling,'' John says. ``We made an
agreement that within three years we had to have it up to $5
million in sales, and I exceeded that in one year. So they're
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   But John's not. He wants Fubu to be as diversified as the main
market segment's moneymakers: Tommy Hilfiger, Polo-Ralph Lauren and
Nautica by David Chu. Fubu has already evolved beyond caps and
fleece separates. The logo is stamped on sport and luxury
outerwear, shirts, jeans and trousers, men's and women's underwear,
kids' clothing and several new seasonal styles of shoes and boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's less about trying to make it and more about creating
an identity for who we are as a company,'' John says. ``Before, the
primary goal was just to succeed ... now I can concentrate on the
integrity of the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Though determined to reach the top of the hip-hop heap, John
readily shares advice with aspiring designers who'd like to emulate
his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Persistence is key,'' he says. ``Surround yourself with a
positive group of people. And always be morally correct. You don't
have to be ruthless and deceiving to make it anywhere. And,
obviously, when you make it big, make it a point to give back to
the people who helped make you.''

 &HT;    SURFIN', DUDE!: A visiting landlubber is tutored by a family of
legendary surfers and learns to hang 10
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. -- I did get up _ got my sorry, narrow
behind up in the air, knees wobbling, arms flailing as if calling
for some runaway water taxi, the rush of the (teeny tiny) wave
drowning out every other noise around me, including the sound of my
own saner thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   And then I wasn't up anymore. I was down. In the deep blue sea.
The board, Velcro-ed to my right ankle by a leash, bobbed in the
chilly Pacific a few feet away. It didn't mock me, exactly; it just
acted like I wasn't there. It nosed around in the opposite
direction whenever I reached for it.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't blame it. I'd just had the shortest short course
possible at the legendary Paskowitz Surf Camp on San Onofre State
Beach, about an hour south of Los Angeles _ a five-minute lecture
from instructor dude extraordinaire Terry Simms, a yellow-blond
surf pro who answers questions about his well-being with replies
such as ``Rippin'!'' But even with only a quickie lesson in the
sand and a few short rides on some meekly crashing white water, I
tasted surfing's mythic pull.
</P>
<P>
   That pull was summed up earlier by Simms, who began surfing at 3
when he and an older brother scoured beach-town alleys for wooden
ironing boards to haul into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the womb,'' Simms said of surfing, ``traveling in
time with this thing that blows you out like ... birth. And then it
annihilates you, man, on the beach. It's like birth, life and death
_ in one wave!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is a gas. Even riding my little white-water mound, I
could feel the power, the hydroplaning rush, the SoCal cool that a
waxed longboard on salt water generates.
</P>
<P>
   And it is pretty hard. That's why people _ kids and adults _ pay
$900 a week for this camp run by one of surfing's most famous
families. They promise to get you up on a board _ whether you're a
gawky mall rat or a buttoned-down, landlocked investment banker
who's never been in the ocean above your flabby thighs.
</P>
<P>
   The Paskowitzes say they shave months from a camper's learning
curve. But one soon learns that simply riding a wave isn't surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Campers ``can expect to learn how to surf, but I think what we
do is make surfers,'' says Israel ``Izzy'' Paskowitz, one of eight
brothers and a former longboard champ who manages the camp. ``We
don't want someone to just say they stood on a board. We turn out
people who are forever touched by whatever it is we all get from
surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds his brother Jonathan, another former surf champ: ``It's not
a lifestyle. It's a life. We're into the romance, the spiritual,
the physical, the primal reward. It's like falling in love, or
falling off a cliff _ it's on that level.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk like that sometimes _ like they're one grain of sand
shy of a beach. Except ... you're with them for maybe a minute and
you're already sucked in by the vibe of a clan once described as
``a curious blend of Swiss Family Robinson and the Partridge
Family.''
</P>
<P>
   That vibe has a long history.
</P>
<P>
   Dorian ``Doc'' Paskowitz, the family's 77-year-old patriarch who
still surfs for campers an hour each morning, moved to Southern
California at 12 and became one of the West Coast's pioneering
surfers. After graduating from medical school, Dorian married
Juliette, a classically trained opera singer from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The two bought a 12-foot-long trailer, and raised nine children
(one a daughter) inside it and traveled the world _ Israel, Hawaii,
Mexico _ in search of the perfect wave. Dorian became a
``missionary doctor,'' hanging his shingle in whatever outpost the
family landed. He and Juliette home-schooled the children, and in
1971 Dorian started the surfing camp to keep the kids together
during summers. They're grown now and live in the area, and as many
as six still work or help at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dorian and Juliette live in a tent in Baja, Mexico, the rest of
the year. Dorian surfs and peddles a self-published book, ``Surfing
and Health,'' an engaging blend of Carlos Castaneda meets the
longboard. It opens with the epigram: ``In the wave there is
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom here begins at the beginning. Campers arrive by sky-blue
school bus at the San Onofre beach _ sacred sand among surfers who
fill its waters like wet-suited sea otters _ from their low-tech
campsite a few miles away at about 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The first day is spent demonstrating the basics: how to put on a
wet suit, lay down their boards, be safe in the water. Then they go
out with instructors: the Paskowitz family, some other pros like
Simms, and the occasional world-class surfer who drops by to ``pay
respect'' to Doc, who's counseled many of them. Skill levels are
determined and then improved the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction is intensely casual, with the lifelong practitioners
who run the camp as interested in the sport's seaside Zen as
ticking off a specific agenda. Campers surf mornings from around 8
to 11, eat lunch under a big beach tent, listen to ``Doc'' read
like some sea-risen mystic from his book, then surf the rest of the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they return to the scrub mountain campsite, made up
of a series of communal tents with showers and grills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place on Earth like this to learn how to surf, with
the people here, the location,'' says Bobby Friedman, a pairs champ
who comes by occasionally to help Doc. ``This is more the surfing
lifestyle. Here there is no clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it worked for Rosie Frangi, a 15-year-old from
Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught the most epic wave two days ago,'' she said one
morning. ``Terry took me way out to catch a special wave. I paddled
as hard as I could to catch one, and the last thing I heard Terry
yell was, `You're going to catch a wave with the great Doc
Paskowitz!' I turned my head and there was Doc, weaving in and out
beside me. I rode it all the way to the beach, and when I got there
Doc's wife and daughter were standing there, watching us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like out of a book or something.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sally's death severs link to way of life
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My mother's lifelong friend and neighbor, Sally Barnes, was
killed in an automobile accident in front of her Alford, Fla., home
this week. For my family, it was more than losing a good friend,
the mother of my children's best Alford playmates. It was the end
of a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sally's late husband, Buck Barnes, was a maintenance man on the
Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay railroad, and therefore they had to
have a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few telephones in the little town, and the
closest to my mother. It was in fact our sole connection with her
when we were at home in Atlanta, and her connection with us. If we
had to talk to her, we called the Barneses. If she needed us, she
called from the wall phone in the Barneses' front room. Messages
could be shouted from front gate to front gate, and we counted on
it in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Slender, sweet-voiced Sally would walk across the dirt street
and check on my mother in time of illness, calling me back with
always reassuring words. ``Don't worry,'' she would say. ``We're
gon' take care of your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   After my son called to tell me Sally had been struck by a truck
as she crossed the street in front of her house, I spent a long
time thinking about how the scarcity of telephones brought
neighbors together in that day. When everybody got a phone, which
they did shortly after the war, there was a slackening of visiting.
You didn't have the excuse of borrowing the phone to carry your
through the front gate. And there was a loss of messages back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   In another day, listening in on a party line served the same
purpose. But when there was no phone in your house, and you
depended on a neighbor to take messages for you, whatever news
there was from your distant kith and kin got circulated.
</P>
<P>
   My little girls, spending summer holidays with their
grandmother, were best friends with Sally's daughters, Linda and
Catherine, who were always thrilled when they would came home with
us to savor the wonders of the big city. I remember that they were
especially impressed by the fountain in Hurt Park.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Alford taught my mother to appreciate the convenience of
her own telephone, the little town also introduced her to the
radio. When I visit there now, we wave in passing to neighbors, but
when radio was new, everybody gathered at the home of the affluent
Mathises for what was known as a ``radio party.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother reported to us about this elegant social-cultural
affair when she visited her relatives in Alford. ``Sarah asked us
all over to listen to her Atwater Kent,'' she told us. ``My, it was
wonderful! You could hear everything from New York and Atlanta just
as plain.''
</P>
<P>
   When I think of Sally Barnes _ a wonderful mother and daughter
who sewed beautiful dresses for her little girls, raised the
prettiest azaleas and camellias in town and lovingly fed and nursed
all her relatives in time of illness _ I think how she was an
important link connecting our family in another day.
</P>
<P>
   My son told me Sally's death brought a wave of grief to the
little town. Oddly enough, the telephone was not what drew
neighbors and relatives closer together. They met at the City Hall,
the fire station and Jay Kent's grocery store to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   They say Alford, and probably even Steele City up the road where
she was a member of the Salem Free Will Baptist Church, will never
be the same again.

 &HT;    Strokes could be prevented with estrogen
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The female hormone estrogen someday could be used to prevent or
treat stroke, if beneficial effects seen in rat experiments can be
duplicated in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
in Baltimore have completed a study in which they gave male rats
estrogen before inducing strokes.
</P>
<P>
   During a stroke, blood flow to the brain stops. Brain cells can
be damaged by the lack of blood as well as by toxic substances
released during the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In the Johns Hopkins study, estrogen treatment halved the amount
of brain damage in the rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting use of a native hormone,'' said study
co-author Patricia Hurn, professor of anesthesiology and critical
care medicine at Johns Hopkins. Researchers aren't sure why
estrogen might reduce stroke-related brain damage although they
suspect the hormone helps improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Hurn and others also are studying estrogen's effects in female
rats. Preliminary results confirm female rats similarly benefit
from estrogen administered before stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke affects 740,000 new victims in the U. S. each year, and
is the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer.
Georgia has the third highest rate in the U. S., with 3,836
stroke-related deaths statewide in 1993, said Dr. Michael Frankel,
an Emory University(Ga.)stroke researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Leading stroke specialist Dr. Lawrence Brass of Yale
University(Conn.) said the study results are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous evidence emerging that estrogen has many
more beneficial effects than we expected,'' Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen's reputation was tarnished in the 1960s, when high
doses of the hormone used in birth-control pills were associated
with a higher risk of blood clots, strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, birth-control pills that contain estrogen have much lower
doses. Estrogen replacement therapy is increasingly considered for
post-menopausal women, to prevent bone loss, heart disease and some
types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns Hopkins study, which was funded by the National
Institutes of Health, was partly inspired by observations that
stroke rates are low among younger women, but begin climbing after
menopause, Hurn said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be long before researchers will know whether estrogen
can be tried as a stroke treatment for humans, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do some further animal studies before the drug
could be considered for clinical trials,'' Hurn said.

 &HT;    Little scream in new `Halloween'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Carpenter's bare-bones 1978 frightfest ``Halloween''
presented an unkillable boogeyman with a yen for butcher knives and
baby sitters. The same approach works less well in this
20th-anniversary sequel, which opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis gamely returns as Laurie Strode, survivor of
the first two films (she managed to steer clear of rotten sequels
Nos. 3 through 6). Now, she goes by the name Keri Tate and is a
single mother to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back is
Michael Myers, the shadowy, personality-free maniac who stalked
Curtis all those years ago. Curtis' real-life mother, Janet Leigh,
has a cameo that recycles lines from her famous ``Psycho'' role.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is how unsurprising ``H20'' is. You can easily
guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of the picture,
literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a la
``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. It whips up 20 minutes of decent scares,
which is at least 20 more than the other current teen-screamer,
``Disturbing Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween: H20''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett and Adam Arkin.
Directed by Steve Miner. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore and
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Twenty years later, barely half as scary.

 &HT;    `Snake Eyes' (mostly) a winning throw
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and longtime director Brian De Palma
roll the dice with ``Snake Eyes,'' and, while they don't come up
total winners, they're far from losers.
</P>
<P>
   Part detective story, part action-thriller, ``Snake Eyes'' takes
place in Atlantic City on the night of a heavy-duty heavyweight
fight attended by 14,000 screaming fans. Our protagonist, Rick
Santoro (Cage), is a cocky cop on the take. Over the next few
hours, he'll find out whether he's still more cop than crook.
</P>
<P>
   Rick's childhood buddy Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise) is now head of
security for the secretary of defense. The secretary is in town to
enjoy the fight and take care of a little business.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Kevin, Rick has ringside seats _ with a higher cost
than he expected. As the champion goes down, shots ring out and the
secretary is hit. Where was Kevin? Apparently lured away from his
post by a mysterious redhead. He still manages to shoot the
shooter, but he's guilt-stricken over his dereliction of duty. No
problem, says Rick, who long ago learned to look the other way when
it was personally beneficial. ``You just tell 'em what you did
right,'' he advises, ``and you throw out the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, however, won't be thrown out. What looks like an
open-and-shut case becomes more complex as different characters
reveal their stories. There's the champ (Stan Shaw), who has a bad
gambling habit and a lot of debts. There's a second mystery woman
(Julia Costello). There's Kevin himself, in both the wrong place
and the right place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the movie takes a single unexpected act of
violence, then deconstructs it by examining events from diverse
points of view. Forget the lone-gunman theory. Rick smells a
conspiracy. Oliver Stone would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma has a lot to be proud of, too. His energized camera
exhilaratingly captures the wired pandemonium surrounding a big
boxing match. The movie's first 20 minutes are, quite simply, a
knockout. That momentum continues as Rick doggedly puts together
the pieces of the puzzle surrounding the shooting. It's only near
the very end, when ``Snake Eyes'' lapses into routine heroics, that
it loses steam.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cage holds things together with his manic, take-charge
energy. He's in his strutting, loosey-goosey ``Leaving Las Vegas''
mode, whether shaking down a small-time drug dealer or studying the
arena's vast array of surveillance equipment for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Snake Eyes'' is a lot like a night at a casino. By
the end, you know the wins and losses don't really add up, but
you've had such a good time it doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise. Directed by Brian De
Palma. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Cage and De Palma are worth gambling on.

 &HT;    A family rebuilds five months after a Georgia couple lost their
daughter in a tornado
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. -- Shannon Wilson had already fixed a breakfast
bottle for his 10-month-old daughter, Hannah, when he noticed the
rain outside the window. This, he thought, is one bad storm.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Robynn, also noticed something strange: The hail was
not hitting the ground, but smacking the window horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   As she turned back to tell her husband, the floor heaved upward,
boards splintering and cracking as a tornado raged through their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Robynn, screaming, grabbed Hannah and hit the floor, only to
have the wind suck the baby from her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon crawled toward the other end of the trailer in an effort
to get to their 4-year-old daughter, Hayley, who had been born with
the birth defect, spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   He never got to her. Instead, he was thrown 150 yards away,
fracturing his neck.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 10 minutes, the tornado _ which cut a 10-mile-long,
half-mile-wide path through northern Hall County March 20 _ was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Where there had been a forest and the Wilsons' mobile home,
there was nothing but debris.
</P>
<P>
   Robynn, bleeding, emerged first from the wreckage and started
digging through their broken home for her baby, whose cries cut
through the silence. Shannon, blinded because both eyes had swollen
shut from boards hitting him, followed the sounds and helped his
25-year-old wife pull wreckage off their baby.
</P>
<P>
   But they could not find 4-year-old Hayley, a little girl who
loved her pink princess dress and the television show, ``Rug
Rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and passers-by took up the search as Shannon and
Hannah were loaded into an ambulance and Robynn followed in a
pick-up truck with a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Hayley's body was found, tucked near the wreckage
of her bed. When Shannon's family identified the body, she merely
looked asleep _ with a small cut above her eye and a tear in her
pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people came to her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud to be her mother,'' Robynn said. ``I was really
touched when I realized how very special she truly was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayley was buried in the Easter dress she had worn the year
before _ by chance, stored at her aunt's home.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of only a few personal possessions the tornado had
not stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon and Robynn painstakingly searched the rubble for
memories of their eldest child: Robynn found her baby book. They
were able to retrieve some photos, their family Bible and Mother's
Day and Father's Day presents Hayley had made at her school,
Challenged Child &AMP; Friends Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley's baby dedication dress was also found _ ``with no mud on
it,'' Robynn said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest pieces (of the house) left could have fit in the
back of pick-up truck,'' Shannon Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time 27-year-old Shannon had lost loved ones.
In 1985, his mother, Pamela Howard Wilson, and youngest brother,
Corey, died in a house fire.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the pain of this moment was much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've buried a parent and I've buried a child, and there's no
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days and months that followed, the young couple would
learn lessons of loss and faith.
</P>
<P>
   They would also learn about the kindness of a community, a
doctor, a hospital and an insurance company that is helping them
rebuild their lives. And how from the darkest of days, hope can
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Wilsons are rebuilding their fractured lives. They
started with help from their church, Woodlawn Baptist Church, and
other community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And although they realize they could never replace Hayley, they
are hoping for a second chance at happiness _ with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Robynn had had her fallopian tubes tied after the birth of their
youngest child in December 1997. It had been a hard decision, but
made on a rational basis. Shannon and Robynn had been married for
five years before they choose this route of birth control. They had
a special needs child and a baby. They wanted to do the best by the
two children they already had and simply did not want to stretch
the family too thin financially or emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   When they decided in June to try to reverse the procedure, they
visited Dr. Clayton Cox, a Gainsville obstetrician who had overseen
the birth of Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had been waiting for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   After the tornado hit the town, Cox had been struck by how many
of the victims who had experienced loss were either patients or
family members of patients. More than a dozen of his patients had
either lost loved ones or their homes, he said. Twelve people were
killed and more than 100 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Sending sympathy cards to the families didn't seem to be enough.
So when the Wilsons met to discuss the reversal, he was compelled
to offer a more tangible form of help. He agreed to perform the
procedure, known as a tubal re-anastomosis, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to be the right thing to do,'' Cox said. ``They
never even got to ask about the cost because I guess I kind of beat
them to the punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox had earlier tried to talk the Wilsons, both in their 20s,
out of having the tubal ligation in the first place. It is unusual
for young couples to choose such a route. And as life unravels,
doctors worry that patients who take such drastic measures will
regret the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 640,000 tubal ligations done each year nationally, about
10 percent of women who do them end up going back and asking for a
reversal, said Dr. Andrew Toledo, of Reproductive Biology
Associates Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal is fairly easy - if the original procedure left
enough of the fallopian tubes to work.
</P>
<P>
   A small incision is made into the abdomen and a plastic tube is
placed through the cervic into the fallopian tubes. Dye is shot
through the tubes to see where the original blockage occurred. That
part is snipped out and then, each tube is resewed.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing the reversal procedure in June with Cox, the
Wilsons walked away with hope.
</P>
<P>
   Cox walked away with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   He would try to get the local hospital, Northeast Georgia
Medical Center, and the Wilsons' insurance company, Blue Cross &AMP;
Blue Shield of Georgia, to donate services and provide the Wilsons
a safety net if something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   June Bozeman, of Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia, was keenly
aware of the community's sorrow. With roots in Gainesville, she
understood the town and the scars the tornado left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already been involved with the churches and blood
drives trying to do everything we could,'' said Bozeman, a provider
network consultant for the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   But when she got a call from Cox's office, she immediately saw
how the insurer could do some good.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a reversal is not covered by insurance companies.
Couples often must pay between $4,000 and $8,000 for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the unusual circumstances, Blue Cross decided to
cover any hospital bills for services. The hospital also agreed to
provide its services at a deeply discounted rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, we've never done anything like this
before,'' said Bozeman, who brokered the deal between the insurer
and the hospital. ``But we thought we could really help bring a
positive ending to a truly tragic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of July 27, Robynn was admitted to the hospital's
outpatient surgery wing. She was calm as she was prepared for
surgery. Cox held her hand as she drifted into drug-induced sleep.
Shannon waited outside.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, which took about an hour and a half, went well. Cox
shot a dye through her fallopian tubes at the conclusion to check
his handiwork. It traveled through her tubes without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   When she woke, Shannon was waiting and told her the good news.
As she curled back to sleep, Shannon kept vigil by her bedside
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Now the couple is back at home in an apartment complex outside
Gainesville. Shannon, a machinist, plans to return to his job at
SKF Bearing Manufacturers in Flowery Branch by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   And Robynn plans to work as a day care worker in the fall at
Challenged Child, a special needs school that gave Haley so much
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   They hope for a child. The first six months is the most
promising after a reversal, with the pregnancy rate hovering
between 60 and 80 percent for women who've had the procedure.
Because Robynn is young and the tubal ligation was recent, the odds
are even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we're hoping for a boy,'' Robynn said. ``But we're
really leaving it up to God. Shannon and I have been through a lot
and we've learned to take things day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon agrees. Right now, he said his priority is to remember
the blessings and keep his marriage strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marriage has gotten much deeper because of this,'' he
said. ``There's been so much togetherness. So much involved.''

 &HT;    Springer brings show back to it's violent ways
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Jerry Springer knows how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   As he promised he would do if a kinder, gentler ``Jerry
Springer'' suffered in the ratings, daytime's hardest hitting
slugger brought his talk show back to the brink of violence in
July. The result: Nielsen ratings, which dropped significantly for
the toned-down ``Springer,'' went back up in metro Atlanta as soon
as the guest confrontations got uglier.
</P>
<P>
   The return to violence helped ``Springer'' claw its way to a
virtual tie with one-time giant ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in July
ratings as metro Atlanta's most-watched daytime talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 145,000 area households tuned in to both shows on
average during July. While that was a 21 percent drop in viewership
for ``Springer'' compared to the recent May sweeps, it was still
enough to match ``Oprah,'' whose ratings remained virtually
unchanged from May and from July a year ago.

   Poll on Tailwind
</P>
<P>
   Americans see CNN's retraction of its Operation Tailwind story
as part of an overall decline in the media's accuracy, according to
a poll to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted July 29-Aug. 2 by telephone of 1,189 adults,
found that 49 percent were aware of CNN's retraction of its
``NewsStand'' story, which alleged nerve gas use by the U.S.
military. Asked if Tailwind was an ``isolated incident'' or if
``the news media as a whole is generally less accurate these
days,'' 55 percent said they are less accurate overall, and 31 said
Tailwind was isolated, with 14 percent not responding.
</P>
<P>
   The research center has also been tracking for three years
whether the public thinks news organizations are generally
accurate, and finds a steady decline, from 55 percent in 1985 to 34
percent in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.

IN BOSTON, ALL ROADS LEAD TO MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston, the ``Athens of America'' a century ago, is called the
Hub by its current residents. Certainly in terms of art, the
moniker is apt. Museums abound, large and small, old and new,
independently run or affiliated with colleges. Some are in the
heart of the city; others form a bright constellation across the
surrounding countryside. At this time of year, most are conserving
energy for the season ahead, and big-effort shows are at a minimum.
But summer downtime is always a good time for a museum visit. The
atmosphere has a casual, glad-to-be-in-the-shade feel.
Permanent-collection galleries are uncrowded and inviting. And
exhibitions that are low on buzz but packed with ideas have a
chance of getting the attention they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, long one of the nation's
cultural treasures, is already revving its engines for ``Monet in
the 20th Century,'' a blockbuster, replete with advance-sale
tickets and hotel package deals, set to open next month. But
there's plenty to see before the crowds descend.
</P>
<P>
   Of two current shows, the smaller is a genial gathering of eight
big recent paintings by David Hockney, the British-born artist who
has lived in California since the early 1960s. Hockney is best
known for his figurative work, notably depictions of Angelenos
living the luxe life around backyard pools. But most of the
paintings here take the form of bird's-eye views of his native
turf: the villages and rolling moors of Yorkshire in northern
England. This is an art of pastiche in every way. Each landscape is
a composite both of snapshots taken by the artist and of various
styles from art history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to York Through Sledmere,'' for example, mixes a
splash of Stanley Spencer and a dab of Richard Diebenkorn in a rich
sauce of Fauve-Pop colors. Hockney has also cited as inspiration
the 19th-century landscape painter Thomas Moran, whose
billboard-size paintings of the American West creaked and rumbled
through the National Gallery of Art in Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moran's flair for scale had roots in a popular tradition of
painted panoramas, the equivalents of Hollywood films in pre-Civil
War America. And Hockney's new work suggests his own preoccupation
with stage design, especially for opera. He brings to the dour
Yorkshire landscape the same hot, transformative palette and
perspectival ingenuity that have distinguished his sets for Mozart
and Wagner, and the results are pretty magical. (Incidentally, the
``Magic Flute'' production Hockney designed will be revived at the
Metropolitan Opera in December.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Hockney showcase is an uncomplicated delight, the second
Museum of Fine Arts exhibition, ``Photoimage: Printmaking '60s to
'90s,'' is something else: a thematic survey of complex variety and
conceptual ambition. Its premise is to examine the inventive ways
in which photography has been incorporated into contemporary art,
losing its documentary function and shaping hybrid versions of
reality in which fact and fantasy blend.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition that results, organized by Clifford Ackley and
embracing work by 72 artists, is visually arresting, historically
sweeping and packed with ideas. At the early end of the spectrum,
one finds Robert Rauschenberg's groundbreaking lithographs,
including ``License'' (1962), in which the Abstract Expressionist
brush strokes serve as busywork filler for a collage of news photos
and snapshots. Pop enters triumphantly with Andy Warhol's glorious
silk-screened Marilyns and Maos, which Ackley complements with less
familiar versions of the same icons: a blurry Mao by Gerhard
Richter, a sheet of Marilyns by the British artist Richard
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, the show is brought into the present with
computer-generated prints by Ronald Jones and Annette Lemieux, and
by Kiki Smith's wall-filling, multipart ``Banshee Pearls,'' whose
reiterated self-portraits and images of skulls are exemplary of a
1990s sensibility. But then, the whole show feels very much of the
moment: Its blend of popular culture, personal obsession, social
uneasiness and formal finesse is entirely in the spirit of new art
being produced today.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, no visit to the museum is complete without a dip
into its dazzling permanent collections. These include the most
comprehensive holdings in Japanese painting in the West, a whole
roomful of John Singleton Copley portraits, and a matchless range
of American decorative arts, thriving under the admirable
stewardship of Jonathan L. Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, just across the Charles River in Cambridge,
has so many museums on campus that it constitutes a mini-Hub of its
own. And some of these have impressive offerings this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Pride of place goes to ``Princes, Poets and Paladins: Islamic
and Indian Paintings From the Collection of Prince and Princess
Sadruddin Aga Khan,'' at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The show,
alas, has only three more days to run, but anyone who can catch it
just under the wire will be amply rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Originating at the British Museum and accompanied by an
authoritative catalog by Sheila R. Canby, the selection encompasses
nearly four centuries of manuscript pages from one of the world's
premier private collections. The images range from a portrait of
lumpish, red-cheeked Ottoman Sultan Selim II holding a teensy gold
wine cup (he was known as ``Selim the Sot''), to chic Mughal court
ladies waving lighted sparklers, to Deccani paintings whose
palettes of canteloupe-orange, mustards and lavender prefigure
Bonnard (or for that matter Hockney) by centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the star attraction is a handful of pages from the so-called
``Houghton Shahnama'' or Book of Kings, commissioned around 1522 by
the Safavid Emperor Shah Tahmasp. The book survived intact into the
20th century, only to be broken up by an American owner in the
1970s. Among the gems at the Sackler _ and one of the greatest of
all Persian paintings _ is ``The Court of the Gayumars,'' a
visionary fantasia of gilded skies, purple rocks studded with
countless tiny faces, and courtiers dressed in leopard-skin coats.
It is said that the page took three years to complete. Stunning is
the only word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Half a block away at the Fogg Art Museum, other manuscripts, of
more recent date, are on view in ``Brice Marden: Work Books,''
organized by Dieter Schwarz, Michael Semff, James Cuno and Harry
Cooper, and visiting Cambridge from the Winterthur Museum in
Switzerland. The show brings together nearly 40 series of drawings
from the artist's notebooks, from 1964 to 1995, and executed in
locations from Greece to India to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The images include early landscapes, Minimalist grids and
organically spun-out skeins of lines inspired by Chinese
calligraphy. Together they suggest how much of a piece this
artist's career has been. Motifs recur, build and change over time,
varying in expressive weight from the hard, adamant verticals of
the ``Suicide Notes'' to the agitated lyricism of ``Athena's
Notebook'' (1979-81).
</P>
<P>
   Whether Marden is drawing with pen, pencil or twigs dipped in
ink, he is a searching draftsman in whom nature and the personal
meet, but always at what feels like a tentative distance. This is
the most persuasive show of Marden's I have yet seen.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wellesley College, in a verdant suburb west of Boston, is home
to the handsome Davis Museum and Cultural Center, which is showing
``Who Are You? Selected Works by Adrian Piper.'' Ms. Piper, a
member of the Wellesley faculty, has long been one of the country's
more provocative political artists, and this tautly edited
anthology of her conceptually based autobiographical work is a good
summing up of her career thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest piece is the drawing ``Self-Portrait Exaggerating
My Negroid Features'' (1981), followed by the series of business
cards she created in 1986, one of which reads ``Dear Friend. I am
black. I am sure you did not realize this when you made/laughed
at/agreed with that racist remark.'' In the 1988 video installation
``Cornered,'' Ms. Piper is sitting at a table and speaking directly
into the camera about the racism that permeates American culture.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when activist art is out of favor in the mainstream
art world, Ms. Piper's intelligent and implacable presence is
particularly valuable.
</P>
<P>
   A short drive from Wellesley, and not far from Thoreau's Walden,
the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln sits turretlike on a high hill
overlooking an unbroken woodland vista. Once a private estate, the
museum opened in 1950 with a strong educational bent and a mission
to collect and exhibit contemporary work, primarily by artists from
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The DeCordova recently inaugurated a new 15,000-square-foot
wing; its light-washed interior staircase climbs several stories up
the hillside. Exhibitions in place there include the 1998 edition
of the ``DeCordova Annual Exhibition''; a showcase of sculptures by
Niki Ketchman; photographs (Dore Gardner's black-and-white shots of
Mexico look especially good), and a lively series of videos made by
teen-agers in the working-class city of Somerville under the
direction of the photographer Roberto Arevalo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, installed in the museum's original galleries, is a
selection of paintings from the permanent collection organized by
Nick Capasso, ``Abstract Expressionism/Figurative Expressionism:
Common Ground.'' The show is uneven, but it has good things,
ranging from abstractions by New England artists of an older
generation _ like Maud Morgan, who is 95 and represented by a
misty, romantic painting in yellow and beige _ to figurative work
by fine younger painters like Sam Messer and Adam Cvijanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morgan has a show of her own in Brockton, at the Fuller
Museum of Art, another small, New England-oriented institution
built in idyllic surroundings, in this case on a pond near an
Olmstead-designed park. ``Maude Morgan: Making Prints 1969-1976,''
organized by Wendy Tarlow Kaplan, includes 29 seriographs, two
lithographs and an embossed print by the artist, in all of which
the brushy style of the painting at the DeCordova is replaced by
stencil-crisp biomorphic forms in solid, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the compositions suggest battle-of-the-sexes
psychological narratives, as in ``Purple Dominant,'' with its
central phallic form, or ``Meeting,'' in which two identical
hatchet-shaped forms, one white, one black, intersect and seem
ready to come to blows.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the work gives evidence of the artist's rapt
enthusiasm for, and contribution to, postwar hard-edge abstraction
and Op Art. Ms. Morgan is a remarkable figure: she knew Hemingway
and Joyce in Paris, studied with Hans Hofmann in the 1930's and
showed with Betty Parsons in Manhattan for years. It's great to see
her here.
</P>
<P>
   Among Massachusetts museums, the Peabody Essex in Salem,
combining two formerly separate institutions, is a cross-cultural
marvel. Much of its collection was accumulated willy-nilly more
than a century ago in the venerable port of Salem, and the result
is a vast curiosity cabinet of art objects, artifacts and souvenirs
(the distinctions are hazy) brought together from America, Europe,
Africa, Asia and the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Here one finds a major collection of American portraits (by
Copley, Trumbull, Stuart), marine paintings (several by the
Luminist Fitz Hugh Lane who spent his life in nearby Gloucester)
and ship figureheads (windblown maidens, highland dancers, Spanish
grandees). There are also fascinating Japanese and Indian materials
(two elaborate portable Shinto shrines, for example); world-class
holdings in China Trade porcelain, and acres of indigenous work
from the Pacific (with the requisite, scary ``headhunting''
relics.)
</P>
<P>
   The museum is still collecting, and is up-to-the-minute enough
to be showing both an interesting series of paintings by the
contemporary Indian artist M.K. Husain from the 1980s, dedicated to
Mother Teresa, as well as a small oil by the estimable Norman
Rockwell, an artist in the tradition of American genre painting
dating back to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   And one can get no better sense of the depths of the museum's
fabulously unfocused collection than in a grab bag of an
exhibition, ``Tales From the Vault: A to Z,'' which includes, among
many, many other things, a size 37 shoe worn by the world's tallest
man, circa 1938; a formidable ``Nevaspred'' girdle from the same
era; an avidly grinning 17th-century Bhutanese dance mask, and a
little Chinese bridal headdress woven of azure kingfisher feathers
and meant to make its wearer feel like a goddess for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important museums are situated at a distance from
Boston but are squarely on the route for visitors coming to or from
New York. The Worcester Art Museum, founded in 1896 by citizens
anxious to smooth the rough edges of an industrial boomtown, is a
textbook example of Gilded Age philanthropy in action. And although
the museum is relatively quiet at the moment, there is, as always,
much to see.
</P>
<P>
   The young Venezuelan-born artist Arturo Herrera, for example,
has recently completed a mural on a wall high above the museum's
imposing Renaissance Court. The painting, with its spare, clean,
wide-open forms (one is reminded of Ms. Morgan's prints), is
basically abstract but carries witty, oblique references both to
its architectural setting and to the extraordinary Roman hunting
mosaic installed in the floor below.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester's classical holdings, many acquired from a dig the
museum helped sponsor at Antioch in Syria in the 1930s, are strong
and a sampling of them is included in new Roman sculpture gallery
recently created under the direction of Christine Kondoleon. The
compact display, titled ``Roman Art and Life Revealed,'' is
elegantly arranged, annotated with stimulating texts, and includes
some memorable things: a marble bust of the somewhat dim-looking
Emperor Caligula from around A.D. 40 (note the Bill Clinton nose)
and a marvelously funky Etruscan cinerary urn (160-140 B.C.) on the
lid of which the elderly patron reclines, propped up on pillows,
while bas-relief soldiers duke it out below.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield comes near the western end of the Massachusetts
Turnpike and is a jumping-off spot for the Berkshires, upstate New
York and Vermont, areas that warrant art excursions of their own.
But the city's cluster of museums, which face one another across a
manicured, campuslike quadrangle, is solidly in the Hub's cultural
sphere: urbane in spirit, international in outlook, curatorially
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield Museum of Fine Art was financed by one James
Philip Gray (1835-1904), a retired coal and lumber merchant who
left his estate for the ``purchase, preservation and exhibition of
the most valuable, meritorious, artistic and high class oil
paintings obtainable.'' A tall order, but he got what he paid for
in the museum's permanent collection of Colonial-era American
portraits and in Winslow Homer's exquisite ``Promenade on the
Beach.'' Another, later donor, Raymond A. Bidwell (1876-1954),
contributed more than 3,000 Japanese woodcut prints, which
instantly and forever put the museum on the Asian art map.

   Other American portraits are on view across the quadrangle at
the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum, in a fine little show
with the slightly iffy title of ``Wheelchair Unbound,'' devoted to
the painter Joseph Whiting Stock (1815-1855). A Springfield-born
artist who was paralyzed in a childhood accident and trained
himself to paint, he is represented here by a touching group of
family portraits, which give a sense of how precious and protective
a thing community was in early America. He is also seen in a
striking self-portrait from around 1843, and again in a
daguerreotype made a few years later, where he looks sucked dry by
the tuberculosis that did him in at the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Stock's was a sad story of pluck in the face of misfortune, but
to conclude a Boston area tour on an upbeat note, one has only to
return to the Springfield Museum and stay a spell in the permanent
gallery devoted to the painter Erastus Salisbury Field (1805-1900).
Born in nearby Leverett, he was a beguiling if idiosyncratic
portraitist (his female subjects tend to wear their hairdos like
ill-fitting caps) before turning his attention to biblical and
historical subjects.
</P>
<P>
   His masterpiece _ and it is a masterpiece _ is the ``Historical
Monument of the American Republic,'' which he began at the end of
the Civil War, when the country's heroic pioneer past seemed like a
mirage, and its future looked uncertain. The painting is a
mural-size panorama of classical temples and stacked-up ziggurats,
each decorated with minute copies of historical works by earlier
American painters, contemporary references (``The Assassination and
Apotheosis of Lincoln''), and allegorical emblems, from Pilgrims
and Indians, to angels symbolizing truth and righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting confection suggests both a painted backdrop for a
19th-century grand opera and, in its fantastical way, the bristling
skylines of contemporary cities like Boston and New York. One
senses that an artist like Hockney would feel right at home with
Field's spectacularly mongrel magnum opus. And there's no question
that its ingredients sum up an American artistic self-image in a
nutshell: think-big aspirations, down-to-earth facts, and the hope
for a home fire, a quick prayer and a good yarn at the end of the
road.

SERGIO MENDES AND BRASIL 99: LOVE SONGS AND OTHER DELIGHTS FROM
BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pop needs popularizers, the musicians who pull
lesser-known idioms into the mainstream. But the most effective
popularizers end up making themselves obsolete; once they've made
clear that a style is accessible, listeners can go to the source
and skip the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Sergio Mendes prolonged America's affection for
the bossa nova by meshing Brazilian rhythms with songs like ``Fool
on the Hill'' and ``The Look of Love.'' More recently, on albums
including ``Brasileiro'' (Elektra) and ``Oceano'' (Verve Forecast),
he has drawn his material from Brazil's best songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Sergio Mendes and Brasil '99, who opened a five-night
stand at the Blue Note on Tuesday night, a pleasant cover band with
a sure-fire repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes' first set Tuesday included songs by Caetano Veloso,
Carlinhos Brown, Ivan Lins, Hermeto Pascoal and Antonio Carlos
Jobim. There were love songs and songs about Brazil's heritage and
its pleasures. The band, with Mendes on keyboards, was supple and
precise as it traversed and blended regional rhythms: samba and
bossa nova from Rio de Janeiro, samba reggae and afoxe from Bahia.
The percussion marched and swished and sputtered; guitar and
keyboards sailed through the harmonies, only occasionally adding
saccharine string-section tones. When songs moved into odd time
signatures, they still had an irresistible lilt.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness was in the band's vocals. Mendes has always chosen
airy, insubstantial female voices, and his two current singers are
no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Together they delivered the melodies smoothly, with a minimum of
personality; individually, they were only adequate. Compared with
the songs' originators or to interpreters like Gal Costa, all of
whom are familiar to American fans of Brazilian music, Brasil '99
was mere easy listening.

`LARRY AND THE WEREWOLF': FULL MOON? THE LAKEVIEW HAS AN UNEXPECTED
VACANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What Johnny Weissmuller did with a jungle yodel, Erin
Quinn Purcell may be poised to accomplish with The Scream.
</P>
<P>
   First employed to hilarious effect for the Adobe Theater
Company's ``Duet! A Romantic Fable,'' Ms. Purcell's perfect B-movie
shriek is again shown to be a valuable Adobe asset, in ``Larry and
the Werewolf,'' a deliriously sophomoric noir-and-monster movie
spoof and an ideal piece of anarchic summer escapism at the Flea
Theater in Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   The serialized detective story, playing in installments on
Saturday nights this month, is a series of blissfully unsuspenseful
interludes rife with bad accents, cheap lighting effects and the
requisite supply of sidelong glances, the portentous sort that
implicate every character, even the dead ones.
</P>
<P>
   Blood splatters, bodies fall, the platinum blond Ms. Purcell
lets loose with her patented talent for high-pitched horror. The
only true crime here is the self-consciously egregious taste of the
author, Jeff Goode, and a rotating pool of directors who seem to
understand their audience's tolerance for goofiness laced with
gore, and try to exceed it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the first episode, directed by Jeremy Dobrish _ a new
installment will be performed twice each Saturday through Aug. 29 _
we meet the recurring characters who frequent the scene of the
crime, otherwise known as the Lakeview Hotel. They include the
mutilated victim, Herberto Hermosa (Arthur Halpern) and his widow
(Ms. Purcell), who finds his body and calls the shady lodge's hotel
dick, name of Dick Piston (Arthur Aulisi), an inept writer of
detective fiction himself, who identifies suspects in every room.
</P>
<P>
   This being an Adobe production, of course, the plot takes wild
detours into other genres _ a werewolf is among the possible
culprits _ and through the yuck-strewn world of odd bodily
functions. One agonized hotel denizen provides Dick with a Polaroid
snapshot of his digestive disorder _ it's a funny bit, but don't
ask _ and various characters step out of the action to become
pitchmen for companies with purported commercial tie-ins to the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Try to memorize as much as you can of what you see, because
you'll be quizzed: a trivia contest about ``Larry and the
Werewolf'' immediately follows each performance.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Larry'' of the title is a mute entertainer, Larry Fingers
(Michael Garin), half of a seriously demented lounge act, ``Larry
Fingers and Spike,'' the headliners in the Lakeview's seedy
cabaret. He's polyester, she's heavy metal. As played by Janice
O'Rourke, wearing the giant crucifix around her neck, Spike is a
heavenly creation in spite of her hell raising.
</P>
<P>
   The ludicrous Larry and Spike are the kind of cross-cultural
figures of fun at which Adobe excells. They're like refugees from a
particularly loopy episode of ``Viva Variety,'' the Comedy Central
sendup of Euro-trashy talk-and-talent shows.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast, playing with the looseness and esprit of an
improv troupe _ it's all performed on a bare stage _ has a great
time with the material, which is the only way to insure that an
audience will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Aulisi, terrific in the Adobe's last production, ``The Handless
Maiden,'' does nicely as the twerpy investigator, and he gets
first-rate support from, among others, Jim McCauley as Aulisi's
fantasy alter ego, Vin Knight as a hotel guest from modern-day
Italy (or perhaps Rome circa 20 B.C.) and Jay Rosenbloom as one
Wolfgang Biederman, a mysterious customer who only appears when
there's a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that a summary of the story so far will precede
each week's contribution, but beyond continuity, the trick here is
to sustain the anything-goes atmosphere without lapsing into
sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   Given a reliable record for cheek and style, you begin to feel
that if any troupe can pull it off, Adobe can.

ADDITIONS IN TEXAS AND A NEW ARMORY SHOW IN NEW YORK

   Australian Chief For the Kimbell
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month search, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth
has named Timothy Potts, director of the National Gallery of
Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, to be its new director. Potts,
who will begin his job in early fall, is replacing Edmund Pillsbury
who had been the Kimbell's director for 17 and a half years and had
announced his intention to leave in January. Potts will be the
third director the 26-year-old museum has had.
</P>
<P>
   Potts, 40, is not well known within the museum world here or in
Texas. But officials at the Kimbell looked beyond the usual roster
of names.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the National Gallery of Victoria for three years,
Potts presided over the oldest and largest public collection in
Australia. Founded in 1861, it has about 70,000 works in its
permanent collection ranging from antiquities right up through
modern masters.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure Potts, who is from Sydney , made the permanent
collection free to visitors for the first time in nearly 30 years.
This doubled the institution's annual attendance to more than 1.2
million, making it the most visited museum in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He also led a building redevelopment, the first phase of which
will cost $85 million. Most of that money has already been raised
from public and private sources. The project will include
refurbishing and reconfiguring the museum's existing building and
creating more exhibition space. Currently only about 5 percent of
the collection is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Potts, whose background is in ancient art and archeology, has
been a professor at the University of Melbourne and an adjunct
professor at La Trobe University, also in Melbourne. He also has a
business background. For five years before joining the National
Gallery of Victoria he was based in New York and London as a
director of the media and telecommunications group in the corporate
finance department of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Potts said the offer to run the Kimbell, a modest-sized museum
with a small but top-quality permanent collection and a large
endowment, was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no plans to leave Melbourne,'' he said. ``But this was
so much the right thing, I had to grab it.''
</P>
<P>
   Potts said he welcomed the opportunity to put on exhibitions
that, while serious, will appeal to a broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``One of the attractive things will also be the
ability to acquire works of art in earnest. I wouldn't be coming if
I couldn't.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Landscapes for Houston
</P>
<P>
   As American paintings catapult into the price stratospheres of
European paintings, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston has received
two important American works: William Merritt Chase's ``Sunlight
and Shadow, Shinnecock Hills'' (1895) and Charles Willson Peale's
``Landscape Looking Toward Sellers Hall From Mill Bank'' (1818).
The paintings are a gift from Nancy Hart Glanville, a trustee who,
along with her late husband James Glanville, began collecting
American art during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both paintings are significant,'' said Emily Ballew Neff, the
museum's curator of American painting and sculpture. ``The Peale
builds strength on strength. We have five works by members of the
Peale family, and this will be the sixth. That it is a landscape by
Charles Willson Peale makes it extremely rare because he did so
few. It is part of the nascent development that gave rise to the
Hudson River School.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff said the Chase work was one of the Shinnecock landscapes,
which are considered the most mature among the artist's works.
Though the museum has a number of pieces by Chase, this is the
first of the Shinnecock landscapes to enter the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The gift comes in the middle of the museum's capital campaign
drive to help finance a $50 million building currently under
construction. The new structure will more than double the museum,
adding permanent galleries for American art, which the museum has
never had.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dealers Show to Move
</P>
<P>
   The dealers who organized the highly successful Gramercy
International Art Fair announced after the fifth one ended in May
that they had had enough. Though they still liked the concept of a
fair that was accessible to small dealers, as the number of
visitors grew, the Gramercy Hotel, where the fair was held, became
an impractical place in which to see art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a new challenge,'' said Matthew Marks, the Chelsea
dealer who was one of the organizers of the Gramercy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Marks and some of the other dealers involved with the
Gramercy are planning a new fair, to debut in February.
</P>
<P>
   Called the ``International Art Show,'' it will be held from Feb.
18 to 22 at the 69th Regiment Armory at 26th Street, the site of
the famous Armory Show of 1913. The dates were purposely selected
to coincide with the American Art Dealers Association show at the
7th Regiment Armory, which will exhibit more classical material as
well as works on the secondary market, while the International Art
Show will feature only dealers who represent new artists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most fairs in New York, which are the invention of
professional show organizers, this fair, like the Gramercy, is
being put together by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a list of 100 galleries that we respected from all
over the world,'' said Marks, who explained that the armory can fit
70 dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Participants so far include Marks, Jeffrey Deitch, Brooke
Alexander, Paul Kasmin and Barbara Gladstone, all from New York;
Christian Nagel from Cologne; Marta Cervera from Madrid, and
Maureen Paley from London.  &QL;

two-hour visit to the sunken luxury liner Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the network's second visit to the legendary ship. An
account of the first expedition was seen in April 1997, by nearly
3.2 million viewers, making it Discovery's highest-rated program to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Using camera-carrying remote operating vehicles (ROVs), some as
small as three feet long, producers hope in the current expedition
to present views of the ship's bow, now famous because of scenes
from the 20th Century Fox movie that won 11 Oscar awards, as well
as the interior of the wreckage of the luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   The program, titled ``Titanic Live,'' will be seen in more than
100 countries with simultaneous translations into Spanish,
Mandarin, Thai and Japanese, network officials said. In addition to
real-time views from a squadron of ROVs, the program is to include
some previously taped segments.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Channel spokespersons said the expedition will last a
month. The network's Internet site, Discovery Online
(http://www.discovery.com), will post live ``webcasts'' throughout
the expedition and allow viewers to ask their own questions of a
team of explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other tasks, the expedition will try to retrieve a 20-ton
section of the ship's hull. A similar attempt in 1996 was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Reid, executive producer for the Discovery Channel, said
that at the request of the Marconi Foundation, an attempt also will
be made to retrieve the wireless radio equipment over which
Titanic's largely futile appeals for help were broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists, historians and explorers accompanying the
expedition, hope to learn such things as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The nature of microorganisms that appear to be eating away at
metal in the ship;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If and why rivets failed when the ship collided with an
iceberg 325 miles off the coast of Newfoundland in 1912 on its
maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether pieces of the vessel can be photographed and digitally
``reassembled,'' similar to the way federal investigators piece
together sections of a crashed airliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to create a tool that naval architects and engineers
can use to study the wreck,'' Reid said. ``We plan to digitally
create a data bank of 24,000 photographs of the entire debris
field.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a camera vehicle will survey the sunken bow and stern,
which are separated by about a half-mile, as well as debris lying
between them, keeping track of its precise position each time it
takes a picture.
</P>
<P>
   When ``reassembled'' with the aid of computers, the images may
shed light on such questions as why the ship's stern shows so much
damage, whether parts of the ship ``imploded'' and where boilers
exploded after the collision, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   He said microbial ecologist Roy Cullimore of the University of
Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada, will study iron-eating bacteria he
believes are devouring elements of the ship's steel, creating
rust-like formations called rusticles that have been observed in
previous expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Foecke, a metallurgist with the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, will try to extend his earlier
observation that the Titanic may have been built of metal that was
not consistently strong. Foecke says he has found poor-quality
metal in some of the rivets that held the ship's hull together.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Best, a British geologist, will collect geological samples
from the sea floor around the ship in an effort to determine how
fast it sank.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand will be Bill Willard, a Seneca, S.C., high school
physics teacher, who with his wife, Susan, designed one of the ROVs
that will try to photograph scenes inside the remains of the ship.
Susan Willard, also a physics teacher, will be in the Discovery
Channel studio, providing commentary on the expedition, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)

<P>
   Robert Ballard, an undersea explorer, located the Titanic in
1985 in 12,000 feet of water. He earlier located the sunken remains
of the German battleship Bismarck and two months ago announced that
he had located the U.S. aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown in the
North Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperating in the expedition is RMS Titanic, Inc., a New York
salvage company that recently obtained rulings by a federal judge
in Norfolk, Va., giving it exclusive photographic rights to the
wreck and drawing a 175-square-mile ``keep out'' safety zone around
the ocean surface immediately above the sunken luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings are being appealed by a British sightseeing company
that has sold tickets for $32,500 each for Titanic visits aboard
deep-sea submersibles.
</P>
<P>
   Although RMS Titanic Inc. has said it will keep any artifacts
retrieved from the wreck site in an intact collection for public
exhibition, it has sold several thousand pieces of Titanic fuel
coal, each about the size of a nickel, for $10 each.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Allen Carlan said a law journal report that
the company would receive $6 million from the Discovery Channel for
the right to produce and air the program was not accurate. But he
refused to say how much RMS Titanic Inc. was being paid, explaining
that the company had a ``confidentiality agreement'' with the
network.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that people were so terrified by the
disease that they wouldn't even utter its name.
</P>
<P>
   So they called it the ``Big C.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, cancer, which has resisted nearly every weapon
medicine has deployed against it since the ``war on cancer'' was
launched 27 years ago, is finally showing signs of vulnerability.
There's no miracle cure, and there may never be. But scientists and
doctors have come to know the enemy, intimately. They now know how
cancer starts, what it takes for tumors to grow, and even how
cancer cells sometimes commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   And they are using that knowledge to battle back in what
longtime cancer-fighters say is the most promising push ever
against the illness, a campaign being waged on numerous fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very optimistic,'' says Dr. Richard Klausner, who as
director of the National Cancer Institute is leading the charge.
``I am, as a scientist, continuously amazed at how much we know now
that we didn't know a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clear to anyone looking at it is that the number of
ideas and strength of those ideas has gone up remarkably. That's
real progress. That's the type of progress we have to make if we're
going to get, ultimately, to our goal of curing cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That progress is most evident in the laboratories of molecular
biologists who devote their lives to unraveling the intricate
machinery within microscopic living cells. Some are learning how to
turn off genetic growth switches that get stuck in the ``on''
position, and to replace tumor-suppressing genes that break and
allow cells to spin out of control. Others, relying on newfound
understanding of the immune system, are developing ways to marshal
the body's own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   And at Children's Hospital in Boston, Dr. Judah Folkman and his
colleagues have proven they can shrink tumors in mice by choking
off the tumors' blood supply. While recent media accounts raised
unrealistic hopes about how fast that strategy might be translated
into treatment for humans, researchers still say this is the most
hopeful weapon on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Emma Carey of Exeter, N.H., stands as living proof
of how such sophisticated knowledge of what goes on inside cancer
cells already is yielding important real-world applications _ and
of how much more it might yield in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When Emma was diagnosed with leukemia last year, doctors at
Massachusetts General Hospital used a new ``molecular diagnostics''
test to spot telltale genetic alterations in her blood cells. With
that genetic profile, ``we could tell her parents that she has an
excellent chance of survival, close to 90 percent,'' says her
physician, Dr. Howard Weinstein. Before long, Weinstein adds, such
genetic profiles may be used to tailor highly specific treatment
recipes to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Even while they are awaiting new payoffs from the laboratory,
cancer doctors are hard at work getting old tools to perform new
functions. &UR;  &LR; That means concocting promising cocktails of old and
new chemotherapy drugs, targeting radiation to tumors in ways that
make it more precise and potent, and fine-tuning surgical
techniques _ all of which are extending and saving the lives of
patients today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war on cancer has worked,'' says Dr. Vincent T. DeVita
Jr., the former NCI chief who helped launch that effort in 1971 and
led it until 1988. ``My projection is that the reduction in
mortality and incidence rates will deepen every year. We'll hit a
30-percent reduction for breast cancer alone by the year 2000, and
overall rates will be down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll do away with cancer,'' adds DeVita, who
now runs the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven. ``But it won't be the
major killer it once was. It will be controllable so people can
live with it, like they do with diabetes, and we'll be preventing a
lot of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disease has long been one of humanity's scourges
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand how far we've come, and how much remains to be
done, it is critical to understand the history of the long struggle
against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has always been one of humanity's scourges, but the
stakes were raised in the 1950s and '60s as more and more people
began dying of cancer. Part of that was attributable to the longer
average lifespan of most Americans, since cancer is primarily a
disease of aging. More sedentary lifestyles and increasingly fatty
diets probably contributed as well. Most of all, however, smoking
caught on widely among men during World War I. Women joined in not
long after. A generation later the toll began to surface in the
form of soaring rates of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As cancer rates rose, doctors fought back, but with few weapons.
Researchers worked to add to the arsenal, but their approach was
hit-or-miss, relying more on happy accidents than on scientific
acumen.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened near the end of World War II, when an
Allied ship loaded with sulfur mustard, a poisonous gas the Germans
had used during World War I, blew up in Italy's Bari &UR;  &LR; Harbor.
Doctors treating the injured soldiers noticed that the gas had
curious effects on key components of the immune system _ white
blood cells were sharply depleted, lymphocytes were impaired, and
blood-forming bone marrow was damaged. That made them wonder: If
the gas impeded the normal workings of those cells, could it also
curb the much-feared lymphomas and leukemias in those tissues
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in New York, and other cancer centers ran experiments,
using a related gas called nitrogen mustard. The results, which
were kept secret until the end of the war, confirmed that cancers
did in fact regress when exposed to the gas, and patients got
better.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that medicine for the first time had an agent
able to shrink tumors, a discovery that seemed especially sweet
since it had been derived from an insidious poison. Soon,
researchers were using what they knew about mustard gas to concoct
other anticancer drugs.

   WASHINGTON _ In a search for relics and ratings, the Discovery

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Practical glamour sounds oxymoronic, but it is, after
all, the secret to mirrored furniture. What other kind of furniture
needs nothing more than a bottle of glass cleaner and a paper towel
to bring it back to glory? Which explains why mirrored furniture _
tables, chairs, screens and the like, all clad in either colorless
or pastel reflective glass _ was such a hit in this country in the
1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its superficial modernity and streamlined chic,
mirrored furniture is a venerable, if underexplored, facet of the
antiques world.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, mirror, a word related to the Latin verb
meaning ``to admire,'' was an extravagance limited to the
financially secure. Though mirrors of polished metal existed in
ancient times, the glass variety did not appear until the 16th
century, when Venetian glassmakers discovered how to pour glass
into small flat sheets that could then be backed with silver leaf
or lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the product was still too costly and limited in size to be
used much beyond royal circles.
</P>
<P>
   A French inventor, Bernard Perrot, figured out how to make large
sheets of mirror in 1678, which led to the Hall of Mirrors at
Versailles four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this French fantasia, said William Rieder, the curator
of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, it was minor German royals like the Margravine of
Baden, a frenetic builder of rococo follies, who really embraced
mirrors' fun-house possibilities. Delirious rooms paneled in
mirrors, or Spiegelkabinetten, sprouted in royal compounds
throughout central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most notable of these is the one at La Favorite, a
villa near Baden-Baden, Germany, where more than 300 mirrors of
every shape and size are set in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But matching furniture remained rare, ignored in Britain (``Far
too serious a country for that,'' Rieder said) and appreciated
little more in France, despite an early championing of the craft by
Louis XIV, who equipped the bed he shared with his mistress Madame
de Montespan with a mirrored headboard.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing New York socialite Dorothy Hirshon, who died in
January, slept in a mirrored bed, too. With a headboard 8 feet high
by 7 feet wide, the Venetian baroque bed, probably made in the
1930s, will be sold in a sale of Continental furniture at Sotheby's
on Sept. 25. It is expected to bring $8,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless, Mrs. Hirshon, like other admirers of mirrored
furniture, liked her bed because of its elegance. Frances Gilmore
Scaife, for instance, is the proud owner of dozens of mirrored
tables, chairs, folding screens and the like, most dating from the
early and middle 20th century, the heyday of reflective furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Disposed among her homes in Pennsylvania, New York and Florida,
her collection, 30 years in the making, was inspired by the
mirrored night stands in her mother-in-law's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were so sophisticated and glamorous, and I
still do,'' said Ms. Scaife, the former wife of Richard Mellon
Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune. ``I can't buy enough
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently: her house in Palm Beach, Fla., which will be featured
in the October issue of The World of Interiors, is a veritable
temple to reflection, from 1930s peach-colored mirror valances in
the dining room to a 1940's mirror-clad fireplace attributed to the
decorator Elsie de Wolfe.

 UNDATED: ... anticancer drugs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news was that the tumors didn't stay down for long,
generally didn't respond to a second round of treatment, and the
scientists didn't know what to do when the ``cure'' fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in 1955 there were relatively few anticancer
compounds that were active, relatively few patients that would
benefit from such treatments, and relatively few scientific leads
we could address and develop and apply,'' recalls Dr. Emil Frei,
now 74 and physician-in-chief emeritus at Boston's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early '60s, when Dr. George Canellos joined the
National Institutes of Health, things had begun to turn around.
``There was a spirit of discovery,'' says Canellos, now at
Dana-Farber. ``It opened my mind to the idea that drugs, medicine,
could be used to successfully treat cancer, where up to that time
there was only surgery.... To resurrect people you thought were
destined to die, you have no idea the feeling that gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   All America seemed to share the feeling that cancer was beatable
when, on Dec. 23, 1971, President Nixon signed the National Cancer
Act and launched a war on cancer he said should yield a cure within
five years. To a country that had managed to put a man on the moon
two years earlier, anything seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs were encouraging, at least in terms of sheer
activity. In the five years after the act was signed, Congress
appropriated more money for cancer than over the previous 33 years.
Cancer centers were funded across the country, and many of the
country's best scientists were drawn to the field. And there were
advances, big ones: &UR;  &LR; researchers developed powerful techniques for
hunting down and isolating genes; physicians pioneered ways to save
the limbs of young patients with bone cancer; and the US Food and
Drug Administration approved early anticancer drugs like
doxorubicin and cisplatin.
</P>
<P>
   But on the cancer wards, progress in beating back the deadly
disease wasn't happening as quickly as the public, and many
doctors, had envisioned. Some of the disappointment came from
chasing false leads. In the late 1960s and early '70s, many
scientists were drawn to the idea that viruses caused most cancers.
In the early 1980s, they hailed the protein interferon as a cure
for everything from cancer to the common cold, which proved too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamental, and more disturbing, was the growing
realization that cancer cells had an uncanny ability to resist
almost every drug thrown at them; some even found ways to spit out
toxic chemotherapies as fast as they were applied, eventually
resulting in the death of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the insight that cancer was not a single disease, but
``at least 100 different entities,'' as Dr. Donnall Thomas, Nobel
laureate and Seattle-based bone marrow transplant pioneer, puts it.
Making progress on one form, such as leukemia, often didn't help
with cancer of the lung, bladder, and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   At the discouraging bottom line were the numbers. Cancer deaths
rose an average of 0.4 percent per year between 1973 and 1990, and
the number of new cases climbed by 1.2 percent a year. Especially
frustrating were increases in lung, breast, and prostate cancer and
the rising death toll from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanomas.
This, doctors and patients agreed, wasn't what was supposed to
happen when America declared war on a disease.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it looked like a medical Vietnam. Critics suggested we
were losing the war and needed to radically rethink our strategy,
focusing more on prevention and boosting the budget for alternative
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of what is now 40 years of focus on treatment have
been seriously disappointing,'' says Dr. John Bailar. Bailar, a
biostatistician who chairs the Department of Health Studies at the
University of Chicago, is a longtime critic of the cancer
establishment, and remains unimpressed even with the recent
downturn in cancer deaths and incidence. The NCI and its sister
agencies haven't achieved as much as they should have for the money
spent, he says, and a lot of what they have achieved has come
through prevention, not treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the '70s, most cancer doctors believed they were
making progress. While critics suggested that position was designed
to perpetuate the unprecedented flow of tax dollars for research,
in retrospect their arguments were compelling. Scientists were
learning how the cancer cell differs from normal cells, an
understanding that often was advanced as much through their
failures as their successes. And despite the rising overall cancer
toll, progress was being made with cancer of the bladder, uterus,
and ovary; the seemingly relentless increases in rates of other
important cancers would finally reverse in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, personally, that the war on cancer was one of the
greatest experiments the US government ever did,'' says DeVita, the
former NCI chief. ``The information we have today on molecular
biology, on developmental biology, all those things came out of the
cancer program.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the researchers were not narrowly focused on
curing cancer. The knowledge fueling today's new cancer therapies
``is a brilliant vindication of curiosity-driven research,'' says
Robert Weinberg, a leading cancer scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge.
The keys, he adds, were that basic science took precedence over
immediate bedside applications, and funding came not just from the
NCI but from a variety of public and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In 1976, `the pieces finally came together'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although cancer is an ancient disease, researchers didn't
discover its root causes until two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans remember 1976 for its celebration of the nation's
bicentennial. But to cancer scientists, it was a watershed year
because, after decades of false starts and wrong turns in seeking
to unmask the origins of cancer, things suddenly went right.
</P>
<P>
   As Weinberg put it in a recent book, ``In one stroke, everything
fell into place. The pieces finally came together.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in the San Francisco laboratory of two
scientists, Harold Varmus, now the director of the National
Institutes of Health, and Dr. J. Michael Bishop, now chancellor of
the University of California in San Francisco. They showed that
cancer arises in human cells when certain normal genes _ later
shown to be controllers of cell growth and division _ are damaged
and metamorphose into cancer-causing ``oncogenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, an articulate scientist with a love of English and
metaphor, and Varmus, an Amherst College grad and
physician-turned-researcher, had teamed up in the '70s to study a
virus that causes cancer in chickens. That virus, it turned out,
does its dirty work by carrying a cancer-causing gene into chicken
cells: The gene triggers the cell's move to malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stunning insight was yet to come. In 1974, a
researcher in the Bishop-Varmus lab found that normal chicken cells
already contained a copy of that cancer-causing gene, but in a
slightly different, harmless form. The virus had only borrowed _ or
stolen _ it. And not only that: Further experiments showed that
most animals, including humans, have carried this Jekyll-and-Hyde
gene, which can become a cancer-causing oncogene, for eons.

 NEW YORK: de Wolfe.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Some of it is wackadoo stuff, just heaven,'' said Ms. Scaife's
decorator, Louis Talotta. His favorite piece is an early
18th-century Regence commode, which was encased in etched mirror in
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Talotta added, ``Most mirrored furniture is just mirror over
plywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on quality and provenance, the price of mirrored
furniture ranges widely, from a couple of thousand dollars for a
simple night stand to $38,000 for a trio of mid-Victorian mirrored
valances, owned in the 1940s by the decorator Rose Cumming and now
at the Manhattan gallery of R. Louis Bofferding on East 71st
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Finding mirrored furniture is easy, but finding it in its
original state is more difficult. ``It doesn't travel well,'' Ms.
Scaife said ruefully of her mirrored treasures.
</P>
<P>
   And should the original glass break, said Roger Prigent of
Malmaison Antiques on East 74th Street, ``matching it is not easy,
and finding someone who can do the work properly is a nightmare.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  At Malmaison, mirrored furniture _ like a chinoiserie
smoked-mirror dressing table by Jansen for $15,000 or a pair of
anonymous American night stands owned by the late philanthropist
Mary Lasker for $6,000 _ is always in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors were especially popular in the 1930s as the tops of
dining tables. Jansen, the deluxe Parisian decorating company
between the world wars, habitually specified them for grand clients
like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, glare walked hand in hand with glamour, especially in
sunny rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give lunches on a mirror-top table must have been
blinding,'' said Bofferding, who specializes in high-style
decorator furniture from the 30s through the 50s. Not to mention
exceedingly unflattering. As Bofferding noted, ``Every double chin
was highlighted, every crow's foot magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why the Duchess of Windsor soon replaced the
mirrored top of the three-pedestal dining table in her Parisian
house with a sober stretch of polished mahogany. The William and
Mary-style table, which the Windsors bought around 1938, sold at
Sotheby's last year for $112,500.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Windsor sale was a Louis XV-style desk, covered with
reverse-painted mirrors depicting gold rococo scrolls. It sold for
$107,000, more than double its estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Like many rich women of her day, the duchess was introduced to
the marvels of mirrors through the English decorator Syrie Maugham
and her American rival, de Wolfe. Maugham, arguably the more
inventive, devised the defining mirrored object of the 1920s: a
room-height folding screen made of seven-inch-wide panels of mirror
framed in half-inch strips of chrome or beveled glass.
</P>
<P>
   When opened into silvery accordion pleats, wrote the decorator
Mark Hampton,``the screen gave the effect of a row of giant
prisms.'' He found one packed away in crates in a client's garage
and insisted on setting it up again.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, de Wolfe became a champion of the all-mirror
room, like the bedroom she installed around 1933 in the Park Avenue
apartment of Robert Rubin, where even the fireplace, cornices and
baseboards were made of molded and beveled mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Later dismantled and owned by the auctioneer Robert Woolley,
many of the bedroom's architectural elements were eventually bought
by Bofferding. He sold the Rubin fireplace surround to the art
dealer Matthew Marks and recycled what remained of the reflective
odds and ends into a coffee table, a large mirror and a pair of
side tables.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the practicality of mirrored furniture that has made
it popular in America, Prigent said, especially dressing tables:
``If you spill perfume on a wooden top, it will eat through the
varnish. But glass _ you can spill anything on it and just wipe it
up.''

 (Repeating for all needing)  
 UNDATED: ... for eons.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; These genes, scientists now know, can serve reliably for many
years but, when altered by chance, a carcinogenic chemical, or some
other damaging agent, can unleash a malignant monster.
</P>
<P>
   Some people inherit a damaged gene, making them highly
susceptible to cancer, often at a dismayingly young age. But most
cancers arise when genes are disrupted by chemicals, radiation,
dietary factors, or the aging process itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since that singular discovery _ for which Varmus and Bishop won
the Nobel Prize in 1989 _ scores of oncogenes have been discovered.
And in 1983, another important type of gene came to light. These
tumor suppressor genes normally keep a lid on overly-zealous cell
growth, but when they are mutated or missing, they allow cells to
divide rapidly and endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   What all those discoveries mean is that today, scientists know
that the human cell is controlled by a highly-complex set of
genetic signals that normally let cells grow and divide in an
orderly way as they replace other cells or repair the body. Cancer
is what happens when that control system breaks down or has missing
parts. Then, like a car with a stuck accelerator or no brakes, the
normal cell evolves into a rapidly dividing tumor cell that escapes
regulation and spawns millions or billions of similarly renegade
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   With this detailed picture of cancer in hand, scientists have
forged a new set of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally gotten a handle on a variety of genetic events
within the tumor and events associated with the development of
cancers, (and now we can) intervene and block those signals or
molecular events to interfere with the progression of cancer,''
says Samuel Waksal, chief executive officer of ImClone Systems in
New York, a biotech company that is developing sophisticated new
cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scores of new drugs are pouring from pharmaceutical and
biotech companies, each aimed at a specific link in the Rube
Goldberg-like chain of events that turns cells cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those medications, like the nearly two dozen
``angiogenesis inhibitors'' based on research by Harvard's Folkman
and others, aren't aimed at the cancer cell at all. Instead, they
seek to destroy the network of tiny blood vessels that surround and
support growing tumors. And because the cancer cell doesn't ``see''
the attack, it can't plot an escape plan.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's most potent anti-angiogenesis drugs, endostatin and
angiostatin, got a huge media bounce this spring even though they
aren't ready for human tests. The enthusiastic stories misleadingly
spoke of a ``cure'' and ``brought premature attention a little
earlier than people in the field wanted,'' Folkman said in a recent
interview. They also raised expectations to unrealistic levels,
although Folkman remains optimistic the drugs will prove effective
in people.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner, the NCI chief, is also optimistic about many of the
new therapies. ``I recognize that most of the ideas we test will
not work out, or we'll have to worm our way through a long
discovery process,'' he says. ``But it's very reasonable to be
excited and hopeful about the significant increase, maybe even an
exponential increase, in the number of ideas.... It's so hard to
describe how important that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are more cautious. One enormous obstacle, they
say, is that tumors are made up of many types of cancer cells,
possibly requiring attacks by combinations of several agents. They
also worry that the new biologic drugs are hard to make and
expensive to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned over the years,'' says Dr. Howard Fine, who
is trying angiogenesis inhibitors in brain tumor patients at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, ``is that cancer cells are smarter
than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lots of progress, but cure is still elusive
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been emotionally and financially backing the
battle against the wily cancer cell for 27 years. Now they're being
told that, while there is clear-cut progress, an out-and-out cure
may never come. All of which raises the question: Does the nation
have the resolve to keep going?
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls suggest it does, in a big way. Eighty-four
percent of Americans think there will be a cure for cancer in the
next 50 years, and 64 percent are confident it will happen within a
decade, according to a nationwide Gallup survey conducted in May.
In another Gallup poll last fall, respondents ranked cancer as
America's second most urgent health problem, tied with rising
medical costs and trailing only AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems equally committed, even congressional
Republicans normally wary of expensive federal programs. While
President Clinton has called for a 50- percent hike in funding for
the NIH and NCI over the next five years, Congress seems determined
to spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress is, I think, poised to double funding for NIH
over a five-year period,'' says Representative John Porter, an
Illinois Republican who chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees funding for medical research. On the
Democratic side of the aisle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, an architect of the 1971 National Cancer Act, is
equally determined: ``I'm strongly in favor of doubling the NIH
budget now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that resolve, and with evidence that death rates are
declining, more than 1,500 Americans will die of cancer every day
this year. And the millions more who are suffering from the disease
are determined to know what's available now, as well as what's
happening in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the day you're diagnosed with cancer, you have no reason
to wonder whether or not what the scientists are saying is true,''
says Laurel Simmons of Cambridge, a graduate student in public
health who was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1987,
but is symptom-free today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are diagnosed,'' she adds, ``they tell you what your
chances of getting out of the hospital alive are. And one of the
first things people do, in a variety of ways, is confront the
possibility of their death.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One way cancer clinicians are trying to reduce such
possibilities is by using their new understanding of how the cancer
cell works to alter the diet, adjust workplace conditions, clean up
environmental carcinogens, change dangerous habits like smoking,
and take other steps to prevent cancer. ``The deep understanding of
the genetics of cancer development in cells that lead them to
become cancer may well have its most profound effect on prevention,
ultimately, rather than on treatment,'' says Klausner.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that and other new weapons, America and its leaders
seem determined to recommit the country to the war on cancer that
they launched 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem thinking about it as a war,'' says Varmus,
the NIH chief. ``The problem is, there's not going to be a day of
surrender. There will be continual battles _ and winning on one
front, like testicular cancer or childhood leukemia, or isolating
genes that let you make risk assessments _ are steps forward. But
they don't cause the other fronts to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a good deal of incremental advances on multiple
fronts... but this is unlike a war where all you need is to take
that last bridge.''

WITCH HUNT ALLEGED (Undated) - U.S. Rep. Don Young, the powerful
chairman of the House Resources Committee, has sent a letter to the
Southwest regional office of the U.S. Forest Service seeking the
names of all federal employees who ``are members of'' or ``have any
contact with'' Arizona environmental groups. Environmentalists call
the letter part of a `'which hunt,'' likening it to McCarthy-era
searches for Ccommunists in the ranks of government. By STEVE
YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCHOOL-COMPUTERS (Undated) - With college students preparing for
another academic year, what kind of computer, if any, should they
consider buying? Laptop or desktop? Mac or PC? What are some of the
best deals around for students? By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story will
move in the ``F`` and ``L`` categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SQUIRREL NUT-BAND (Undated) - One evening as musician Jim Mathus
relaxed at home, he decided to teach his wife a cute vintage song
on the banjo. It was at that moment that he noticed something very
peculiar about his soulmate. She had one of the strangest singing
voices he had ever heard.Mathus chose to build a band around her
sleepy song stylings. He named the North Carolina swing group after
a vintage candy bar, and the seeds of the Squirrel Nut Zippers were
planted. By KATHY CANO-MURILLO. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOBCAT-COMEDIAN (Undated) - Bobcat Although Goldthwait, 36, has
done stand-up for more than half of his life, only recently has he
worked his other job, that of host of ``Bobcat's Big Ass Show,``
which runs weeknights on the FX cable channel. Not that Goldthwait
is a stranger to outrageous behavior. Remember, this is the same
guy who, in 1994, smashed up the set on ``The Arsenio Hall Show``
and set a couch ablaze on ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. By
MONTY PHAN. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SNAKE EYES-MOVIE (Undated) - Someone assassinates the U.S.
secretary of defense in the middle of a frantic Atlantic City
casino, and Nicholas Cage has two hours to figure out who did it
before the FBI steps in. This is Brian De Palma's $69 million
challenge to ``Saving Private Ryan's`` huge box office. 4 stars. By
BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHERMAN-POPSTAR (Undated) - After setting up a phone interview for
12:30 in the afternoon, Bobby Sherman's publicist offers a friendly
warning: ``He'll call you at 12:30 on the nose. He's very prompt.''
Punctuality in pop stars is about as common as facial hair among
the Hanson brothers. But Sherman never was your typical pop star.
By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PENN &AMP; TELLER (Undated) - Penn &AMP; Teller aren't reverent about
anything. Their stage magic show is a full-frontal deconstruction
of every hoary cliche the ancient art has produced. In it, they
gleefully lampoon all kinds of truths commonly held to be sacred.
So, who would expect them to be reverent about plate-spinners and
odd puppet acts? The duo's new series on the FX cable network
presents pop music acts side-by-side with top-notch practitioners
of the variety arts, all on one Las Vegas stage. Plus showgirls, of
course. By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARIE BAIE-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is the tale
of one summer in the life of two young lovers on the Riviera who
get in over their heads. 2 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in
the ``E'' category.  &QL;

AMERICAN EXPRESS STOCK FALLS AFTER COMPANY CITES OVERSEAS WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nervous investors drove shares of American Express
Co. down 6.8 percent Thursday after the company warned that its
growth overseas would be hampered by the Asian financial crisis and
a broader softening of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the interdependencies among markets, the effects of Asia
will eventually spill over,'' American Express chief executive
Harvey Golub told analysts at a meeting in New York on Wednesday.
``We can expect to see the impact of Asia on Latin America, and
have seen it to some extent in Europe and the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express is one of the most geographically diverse U.S.
companies and, while no single company is a proxy for financial
developments overseas, many analysts and investors look to American
Express for insights about global business prospects _ particularly
as they pertain to the company's core travel services and credit
and charge card operations.
</P>
<P>
   Golub said American Express had hoped, within a ``reasonable
time frame,'' to increase its overseas profit 25 percent to 30
percent a year, with earnings from abroad accounting for half of
overall profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current economic slowdown, however, is depressing the
financial results of both our card and travel business and will
likely delay our progress in attaining these `mix' goals,'' he told
the analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of American
Express plunged $7.375 Thursday, to $101.0625, on nearly five times
the normal trading volume.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think the sky is falling because it's too early to
figure it out,'' said Samuel Liss, an analyst with Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``I think the Asian problem and the impact of the
euro on their foreign-exchange business are among some of the
things they need to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Golub spoke privately with the analysts Wednesday, and the
company did not distribute copies of his statements more widely
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Golub said he thought the company would
``continue to do well, but it will not be as easy or simple to
match the performance of the last two quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express has posted solid financial results lately,
driven by an upswing in its card business and tighter expense
controls. The company recently reported that its second-quarter
profit increased 11 percent, to $578 million, compared with $520
million in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to
$4.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Golub said there were important unknowns, including the
possibility of further economic deterioration in Japan or a
downturn in China, as possible ``risks in our ability to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blow for American Express was its decision this year not
to bid on the U.S. government's card account, which had been an
important account to the company in terms of billing volume and
number of cards. Golub said American Express was not willing to go
after a contract with the government if a bidding war meant that
that the profitability of its card business would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts thought that the stock market overreacted Thursday
to Golub's comments, noting that the warning was evidence of
cautious management and a prudent approach, given current economic
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this company and think they have a lot of
flexibility on the expense side and have a strong financial
cushion,'' said Susan Roth of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. She
added that ``all financial service companies are considering how
their resources should be managed, given the spillover from Asia.''

COMPUTER A NECESSITY ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What once was a luxury for college-bound students now
has become as standard as JanSport backpack and a Sony Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers have moved from novelty to necessity in the
'90s, despite large computing resources on most college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly encourage all students to come with a computer,''
said Bill Lewis, vice provost for technology at Arizona State
University in Tempe. ``We do provide computers on campus, but you
have to get in line and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   With one computer to every 17 students, ASU beats the
educational goal of 1-to-20. But statistics are little consolation
when you're camped out for hours watching other students hunt and
peck on a keyboard the night before your major research paper is
due.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for students, the price of personal computers continues
to plummet. Much of the credit goes to Intel Corp., which recently
slashed the price for its 266-megahertz Celeron processor to $86
from $106, its lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mac devotees can find deals. Apple Computer is releasing
its first consumer-oriented Mac, the iMac, next week. Price:
$1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, never ones to miss a marketing opportunity, are
jumping on the back-to-school bandwagon to sell systems and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly think that going back to school is a great time
to find some deals,'' said Carol Elfstrom, a spokeswoman for
CompUSA in Dallas. The chain is taking reservations for the iMac
and offering $800 worth of mail-in coupons for Apple-related
software and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In the more prevalent IBM-compatible world, computermakers are
offering discounts for college students. Dell Computer Corp. is
offering five systems, ranging in configuration from minitowers to
notebooks, for students who can prove they are enrolled in college.
The systems start at $1,540 and top out at $2,950.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Compaq Computer Corp. is offering $100 mail-in
rebates on its Presario PC, monitor and color inkjet printer. The
PCs range from $799 to $2,299, after the rebate, and are sold at
major computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy students may want to wait to get to campus before
plunking down any money. At ASU, for example, Dell, Apple and
others offer discounts through its computer store. Other
universities offer similar deals through campus book stores.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger savings can be had on software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wait to tell them to buy their software,'' ASU's Lewis
said. ``The educational price is much, much better than you get at
the computer stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis cited a $250 discount on a $300 word processing,
spreadsheet and presentation software package. Similarly, the
widely used Statistical Package for the Social Sciences goes for
$1,200 in computer stores but only $150 from the ASU Computing
Store.
</P>
<P>
   As for the laptop vs. desktop question, students should consider
space, convenience and theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend a laptop because of the convenience of being able
to take it to class to take notes or work on in other areas of
campus,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside for laptops are their premium cost and
temptation for theft. Although cable locks are available to
discourage theft, a good pair of wire cutters can get around them.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop computers, meanwhile, are cheaper, less of a target for
thieves and can be expanded with faster microprocessors and other
components.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, more students than ever are investing in PCs. A
study last year by ASU found that 60 percent of students have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by electronics store Best Buy found that 39
percent of all freshmen would pick a computer or word processor
over a stereo (23 percent) or TV (13 percent) if they could take
only one item to their college dorm room.

COMPUTER A NECESSITY ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What once was a luxury for college-bound students now
has become as standard as JanSport backpack and a Sony Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers have moved from novelty to necessity in the
'90s, despite large computing resources on most college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly encourage all students to come with a computer,''
said Bill Lewis, vice provost for technology at Arizona State
University in Tempe. ``We do provide computers on campus, but you
have to get in line and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   With one computer to every 17 students, ASU beats the
educational goal of 1-to-20. But statistics are little consolation
when you're camped out for hours watching other students hunt and
peck on a keyboard the night before your major research paper is
due.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for students, the price of personal computers continues
to plummet. Much of the credit goes to Intel Corp., which recently
slashed the price for its 266-megahertz Celeron processor to $86
from $106, its lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mac devotees can find deals. Apple Computer is releasing
its first consumer-oriented Mac, the iMac, next week. Price:
$1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, never ones to miss a marketing opportunity, are
jumping on the back-to-school bandwagon to sell systems and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly think that going back to school is a great time
to find some deals,'' said Carol Elfstrom, a spokeswoman for
CompUSA in Dallas. The chain is taking reservations for the iMac
and offering $800 worth of mail-in coupons for Apple-related
software and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In the more prevalent IBM-compatible world, computermakers are
offering discounts for college students. Dell Computer Corp. is
offering five systems, ranging in configuration from minitowers to
notebooks, for students who can prove they are enrolled in college.
The systems start at $1,540 and top out at $2,950.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Compaq Computer Corp. is offering $100 mail-in
rebates on its Presario PC, monitor and color inkjet printer. The
PCs range from $799 to $2,299, after the rebate, and are sold at
major computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy students may want to wait to get to campus before
plunking down any money. At ASU, for example, Dell, Apple and
others offer discounts through its computer store. Other
universities offer similar deals through campus book stores.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger savings can be had on software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wait to tell them to buy their software,'' ASU's Lewis
said. ``The educational price is much, much better than you get at
the computer stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis cited a $250 discount on a $300 word processing,
spreadsheet and presentation software package. Similarly, the
widely used Statistical Package for the Social Sciences goes for
$1,200 in computer stores but only $150 from the ASU Computing
Store.
</P>
<P>
   As for the laptop vs. desktop question, students should consider
space, convenience and theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend a laptop because of the convenience of being able
to take it to class to take notes or work on in other areas of
campus,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside for laptops are their premium cost and
temptation for theft. Although cable locks are available to
discourage theft, a good pair of wire cutters can get around them.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop computers, meanwhile, are cheaper, less of a target for
thieves and can be expanded with faster microprocessors and other
components.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, more students than ever are investing in PCs. A
study last year by ASU found that 60 percent of students have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by electronics store Best Buy found that 39
percent of all freshmen would pick a computer or word processor
over a stereo (23 percent) or TV (13 percent) if they could take
only one item to their college dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are responding by wiring more of their dorms than ever
with high-speed Internet connections. At ASU, several dorms have 10
megabit connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're actually using it to help market certain dorms to
students,'' Lewis said. &QL;

TEXAS COUNTY EXPLORES POSSIBILITY OF SETTLING LAWSUIT WITH MISSOURI
INMATES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGLETON, Texas _ With the potential of a large jury verdict
looming, attorneys for Brazoria County have agreed to explore
settling a lawsuit filed by Missouri prison inmates who say they
were mistreated by jail guards and sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement negotiations, which may occur next week, could
head off a September trial date for 25 Missouri prisoners who have
sued Brazoria County, five of its past or present law enforcement
officials, a private company that leased jail space from the county
and two of the defunct company's former employees.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is in Angleton, an east Texas city of 19,500
residents about 35 miles south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' lead attorney, Lynn Klement of Angleton, said
Thursday that he is ``not extremely positive'' a settlement can be
reached but said he hopes Brazoria County Sheriff Joe King's
opposition to settling the case will not thwart an out-of-court
ending.
</P>
<P>
   County commissioners court would have to approve any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county leaders will make whatever decision is best for the
county, I hope,'' he said. ``This certainly has the potential for a
large jury verdict. There is a lot of information we've developed
that has the potential for making a lot of people angry.``
</P>
<P>
   Klement said that includes evidence that Missouri officials and
the Texas Commission on Jail Standards were misled about the events
of Sept. 18, 1996, when a videotape was made showing sheriff's
deputies clad in riot gear and one employee of Capital Correctional
Resources, Inc., conducting a shakedown of the jail that entailed
some prisoners being manhandled, bitten by a dog and subjected to
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials, who reclaimed all their prisoners nearly a
year later after they saw the videotape, complained that officials
with Brazoria County and the private jail complain didn't fully
inform them of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of civil suits have been filed by the Missouri
prisoners, including one in U.S. District Court in Galveston and
about a dozen others in Missouri federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Three defendants in the Galveston lawsuit _ former Brazoria
County officers Lester Arnold, 47, and David Cisneros, 38, and
former CCRI officer Wilton David Wallace, 51 _ were indicted last
week by a federal grand jury on a charge of violating an inmate's
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to answer questions this week during a deposition
for the civil suit and invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Klement, the inmates' attorney, said videotape of the men
declining to answer questions will be shown to a jury if the case
goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them questions like, `Did you slam an inmate's face
into a wall on such-and-such a date?,' and when they answer `I
invoke my Fifth Amendment right,' that can be pretty damning. I can
show that to the jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Brazoria County and CCRI were not available for
comment Thursday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: TV tries to admit its Monica problem
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- TV was very sorry it had to bring you the day's
biggest story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but feel a little bit funny about it,'' co-anchor
Kevin Newman confided to Sam Donaldson on Thursday on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' He was talking about how it felt to talk about
Monica Lewinsky, the day's biggest story, again.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson could feel Newman's queasy tummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a seamy story,'' agreed Donaldson, posted like a trusty
terrier on the White House lawn, where one could imagine that the
second the cameras blinked off he'd be standing on tippy toes to
peek through the Oval Office windows. ``None of us likes to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody liked to talk about it. Goodness no. Apologizing for
covering the Lewinsky story has become an almost required preface
to the media's blizzard of coverage. It's a way TV can better
connect with us: We say we don't like to watch it, so TV says it
doesn't like to bring it to us. That way, when it brings it to us,
and we watch it, everybody can feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about the dress: I think we can all concede this is
a distasteful topic of conversation,'' is the way Mary Tillotson
back-doored her way into the subject on ``CNN &AMP; Co.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would like never to hear about this case
again,'' piped in Time writer Elaine Shannon, before helping
Tillotson fill a half-hour on the topic. She then added, as if
defending her opening her mouth: ``But it is in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the Lewinsky story that the media found so icky.
It was the way the media acted, too. They're all animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you say zoo?'' Katie Couric sighed on NBC's ``Today.''
``Apparently the media began assembling last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Couric then cued Lisa Meyers, the NBC correspondent stationed at
the U.S. District Courthouse in Washington. She looked as if she'd
been up all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is crawling with reporters,'' put in CNN
correspondent Bob Franken, seated in a kind of camera-friendly deer
blind, above the fray and beside legal analyst Roger Cossack (and
later Greta van Susteren). Commenting on the day's comings and
goings, the two looked as if they were hosting a Rose Bowl parade.
</P>
<P>
   Cossack then observed from his perch, almost chuckling, ``Some
of the press is just covering the press.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have been peering down at WSB political reporter Bill
Nigut, who at almost that very moment, was busy interviewing
Cynthia Alksne, a ubiquitous TV gadfly.
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't interviewing itself, TV interviewed regular
people _ about itself. It was televising its own therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it something we should be obsessing with?'' CNN's Brian
Cabell asked a resident of Albermarle, N.C., where he spent the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Albermarle resident told him it was not, Cabell moved
on to another resident. And another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward recovery is admitting you have a problem.
TV's trying. But it's sure not pretty to watch.

PRIMARY RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSERVATIVE GOP'S STRENGTH IN
KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK and JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: For two successive elections, conservative Kansas
Republicans claimed victory after victory, but Wednesday the
results of the primary election left them stung by defeat after
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Lifted by a powerful showing from Gov. Bill Graves, moderate
Republicans made gains in the Kansas House, claimed control of the
Republican Party in Johnson County and Shawnee County, and said
they might take back the entire state GOP organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the lopsided defeat, David Miller, who hoped to
translate conservative strength into an upset of the moderate
governor, didn't attend a Republican Party unity breakfast in
Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Although conservatives will continue to wield power in the
Legislature and in the state's congressional delegation, the
election results raise questions about the vitality of the
conservative Republican movement in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the turn in going back to a moderate Republican
Party,'' said Rep. Ray Cox of Bonner Springs, a GOP moderate who
survived a concerted conservative onslaught and won on primary
night.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans said they remain a force in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose a battle, it doesn't mean we've lost the war,''
said Tim Golba of Olathe, political director for Kansans for Life,
an anti-abortion organization whose members often back conservative
Republicans. ``We'll be back in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion activists, he said, already were recruiting
candidates to run for the Legislature in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With conservative-moderate emotions running high, Republicans
sought Wednesday to pull the two wings of their party together for
the November general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take the strands of this great party and start
weaving them together,'' U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback told the nearly
100 Republicans at the unity breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who lost to Graves 73 percent to 27 percent, was listed
by Republican Party officials as a speaker but never showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting some much-deserved rest,'' said Kris Van
Meteren, the Miller campaign manager who did attend the breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP chairman, Steve Abrams, was at a loss to explain
Miller's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to be here,'' Abrams said. ``It would
have been better if he'd been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's absence was emphasized by a lone empty chair and a
``David Miller'' nameplate at the head table.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the Graves victory exceeded what many
politicians thought possible. Miller didn't win a single county,
and in some counties received as little as 16 percent of the
Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   But at the unity breakfast, Graves embraced those who backed
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly respect the views and the very significant
constituency within the Republican Party that David represents,''
Graves said. ``I have to acknowledge that constituency and those
views as we move forward toward this general election.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Miller who helped organize conservative Republicans
around Kansas during the early 1990s, an effort that resulted in
conservatives' taking control of the GOP organization in late 1994
and early 1995. In 1995, conservative Republicans dominated the
Kansas House, and in the 1996 elections conservatives gained
strength in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's primary, however, several notable results emerged:
</P>
<P>
   Three moderate House members, Cox of Bonner Springs, Rep.
Barbara Allen of Prairie Village and Rep. Cindy Empson of
Independence turned back strong challenges from conservatives.
Another moderate, Patricia Lightner of Overland Park, won in a
Johnson County district.
</P>
<P>
   In two House districts in Topeka, now held by conservative
Republicans, moderate Republicans won the GOP nomination and are
favorites in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Republican lost to a conservative in a House race
near Wichita, but moderate Republicans prevailed in key House races
in Garden City, and in two central Kansas districts.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives and moderates, each with five members on the state
Board of Education, engaged in a spirited tussle. Prognosticators
think that after the November elections, the 5-5 split will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their candidates for precinct committeemen and
committeewomen in Shawnee County won solidly over conservatives. In
Johnson County, moderates said they won about 50 more precinct
committee positions than conservatives did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got whipped,'' said Rep. Tony Powell of Wichita, an
outspoken Republican conservative. ``It is a big defeat. I think it
set us back. I think we will bounce back from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said that some of the moderates who did well in the
primary election, like Graves, talked often of tax cuts, which were
a prime conservative issue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the showing by moderates, the Kansas House still will be
controlled by conservatives _ although the split will be narrower
next year than it was this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative, Sen. Karin Brownlee of Olathe, said
conservative Republicans won't disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win some and you lose some, that's how I look at it,'' she
said. ``We'll move forward.''

WITH CHANGES APPROVED, KC MAYOR LOOKS AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the successful Liberty Memorial and
stronger-mayor charter elections behind him Wednesday, Kansas City
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver moved quickly to reinvigorate an issue that
could consume the remaining eight months of his term and beyond _
light rail.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cleaver praised the Kansas City Area
Transportation Authority for its recent progress on transportation
issues and urged the transit agency to spend $1.3 million in
remaining grant funds to complete its light rail corridor study.
</P>
<P>
   Also during Wednesday's interview, Cleaver:
</P>
<P>
   Assessed voter approval of the Liberty Memorial restoration and
stronger-mayor charter changes as a boon to his second-term legacy,
far overshadowing the public corruption convictions that have
marred his tenure since his 1995 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Pledged to make another attempt at getting voter approval of a
storm water fee proposal that failed in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled out ever moving to Washington to accept a post in the
current or future Democratic administrations and said he would
remain active in Kansas City civic affairs after leaving office in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But light rail was Cleaver's topic of the day, and he was eager
to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to kill light rail, but rather intelligently
build light rail,'' Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Cleaver dismissed the ATA's light rail plans as
``touristy froufrou,'' saying it would do little to get poor people
to work. His comments sparked a critical review of the proposal by
the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce that appeared to kill
its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Cleaver praised the ATA's progress on
conventional surface transportation since his criticism. He said
the agency had done a good job of obtaining federal grants to buy
new buses, marketing and advertising its existing service and
exploring innovative ways of exploiting its current unused
capacity, such as its transporting Kansas City School District
students on city buses, rather than on leased vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ATA General Manager Dick Davis said he was encouraged to hear
Cleaver's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted to hear the mayor's comments and that we (have
been) more responsive to his concerns and open a discussion about
light rail,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cleaver said he would support a light rail
planning process that involves all stakeholders in the project,
such as government and business leaders, property owners and
transportation providers. But the discussion must put light rail in
the context of a regional transportation system that gets workers
to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a delicate period for poor people,'' Cleaver said.
``We've got to get people to jobs, and those are north of the river
and in western Johnson County.''
</P>
<P>
   Just such a program is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber Executive Director Peter Levi, who met with Cleaver on
the issue Tuesday, said his group is working with the Mid-America
Regional Council to assess area transportation demands. That could
lead to integrating commuter rail, buses and possibly light rail
into a coherent regional public transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light rail is not dead,'' Levi said. ``It needs to be
considered in the context of a total metropolitan transportation
system. The mayor and the chamber are interested in reviewing
public transit, and light rail is a key part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver did not endorse a particular route for a light rail
spine, but said he hoped any new plan would include spurs to Kansas
City's East Side and West Side communities.
</P>
<P>
   But any such proposal likely would come long after he has left
office, Cleaver acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said the voters' decisions on two ballot issues Tuesday
_ Liberty Memorial and stronger mayor _ will allow his work at City
Hall to be judged more kindly when he's out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Cleaver fretted that his legacy could be forever
tarnished by the City Hall's public corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will go a long way to overcoming the courthouse shadow
that has come over this building,'' Cleaver said. ``There was a
time when I wondered whether discussions about the '90s in
municipal government would center on corruption. As significant as
those events were, they still should only be a blip on the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said he hasn't yet made specific plans for life after
the 29th floor, though some interesting, but untold, suggestions
are coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never sit on the sidelines and be a fan,'' Cleaver
said. ``But I'm not going to try and be a major player in the
political arena, and I've committed myself to spending the rest of
my life in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was a little ticked that voters approved all municipal
ballot issues Tuesday except for a measure that would have changed
the way the city calculates fees for storm water runoff. He
promised to return the issue to the November ballot without the
imposing ``Impervious Surface'' title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come up with a better synonym, put it on the
ballot and quit showing people we went to college,'' he said.

EMPLOYEES APPRECIATE EMPLOYERS' SPECIAL REWARDS

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Miranda Byrd noticed their faces. She saw
retail clerks at a Johnson County, Kan., mall flash expressions of
amazement, excitement and envy when they learned why there was a
sudden influx of giddy shoppers Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, along with about 145 colleagues from Barkley Evergreen &AMP;
Partners, went on a shopping spree, courtesy of their boss.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m. Monday, the Kansas City marketing and advertising
agency took a break. President Scott Aylward and human resources
Vice President Kay Moore herded the entire agency work force from
the offices into four yellow school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Secret destination: The mall.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Spend a $100 gift certificate on yourself _ nothing for
anyone but you _ before you get back on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd bought what she calls a ``totally tangerine-faced fossil
watch that covers most of my arm.'' It was, the assistant broadcast
buyer added in understatement, ``not your typical Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward said the agency always had tried to reward its workers.
In the past, he has walked around the office a couple of times a
year handing out $100 bills. This time, the reward came with a
twist: ``We wanted this to be a totally self-indulgent day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Gage, a public relations senior account executive, said
the agency always had been good about giving its partners ``little
surprises.'' (Notice the word she uses _ ``partners'' _ not
``employees.'') This little surprise, which netted her a necklace
and a pair of shoes, ``showed that the company understands how
important it is to take time to reward everyone for their hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the secret shopping spree and other rewards programs
were a way to counterbalance the competitive, stressful environment
created in the ad business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important for us as a company to remember it's
OK to have fun,'' the human resources officer emphasized. ``It's OK
to stop and say we've all been working hard...We spend a lot of
time and money to make sure this is the kind of place people want
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kevan Gibbs is pretty sure he made the right
choice, and we're not talking about the shoes he bought. Gibbs, a
public relations account supervisor, was on his first day on the
job when the exodus to the buses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``While everyone was extremely nice and welcoming, I couldn't
help but wonder what my second day would hold,'' Gibbs noted. It
was, he added, a great way to begin a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees missed the trip because of vacations and other
days off, but they, too, have gift certificates to spend on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an amazing way to say, `Thank you.' &UR; '' bubbled
Kristy Enlow, who works as a desktop publisher. Enlow, who bought a
purse, scarf and lotion, added, ``It doesn't matter what level you
are at this agency, they always find a way to make everyone feel
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours out of a workday. About $16,800 out of company
coffers. It was an investment Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners could
afford. But that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, in a highly competitive and demanding work
environment, is how many companies can afford not to do something
similar. Such gestures go a long way to help retain and reward
productive workers.

   UNDATED: There was a time in the newspaper trade when decorum
counted for something.
</P>
<P>
   If a man reporter showed up in this office without a necktie,
George Burg, then the assistant city editor, would send him home to
fetch one.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds impossibly quaint now. But the reasoning was simple.
There was no knowing what the day might bring. It could be
necessary to send someone to interview a person of importance _ a
foreign diplomat, a captain of industry, a much-decorated general,
even possibly the president.
</P>
<P>
   George was not about to dispatch some staff member who looked
like he'd just crawled out of the corner pub.
</P>
<P>
   There were more intimate matters of discretion. In cases of
sexual assault, for example, not only did we not name the victim.
We let the description of the offense stand at that _ sexual
assault _ on the grounds that no interest except the prurient would
be served by providing further details.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the name of exactitude, we take great care to indicate
the orifices involved in the crime, probably delivering more on
that subject than many readers would prefer to know.
</P>
<P>
   I even remember pushing the envelope of propriety myself once.
</P>
<P>
   It was years ago, in the early '60s. In researching a story on
the vagrant and homeless, I had spent the night on a cot in the
vast common room of a 50-cent flophouse filled with men whose luck
had run out.
</P>
<P>
   In writing the piece, it was necessary to describe the odor in
that dismal hall _ a sour effluvium of unwashed bodies, filthy
clothing and other things, one of which I was hesitant to name.
</P>
<P>
   I searched the dictionary until I came upon a solution, a term
that was absolutely precise, yet clinical enough to avoid giving
offense. The word was ``flatus,'' and if you don't know what it
means, you're welcome to look it up for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The story appeared on a Sunday. The next morning a senior editor
strode over to my desk wearing a solemn face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' he said, not meaning that at all. ``It's
the first time that word has appeared in our newspaper.'' From the
way he said it, I guessed it also would be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   I've thought of that little incident more than once, while
following the coverage of contemporary events in Washington in
general, and the matter of Monica's infamous dress in particular.
</P>
<P>
   With a specificity previously achieved only by publications that
arrived in plain brown wrappers, we have wallowed in speculation
about the alleged stain _ what it is, how it got there and what
implications it might hold for the fate of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, now we are exploiting the subject for its pure
entertainment value, turning out jokey sidebars, playing to the
crudest sort of public taste, and proving by our cheap worldliness
that the press is as uncouth as it is free.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way, haven't we? But instead of feeling proud
about it, there are days when this business is embarrassing.

<P>
   The Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival, which opens its 15th
season this weekend at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church on
Long Island, N.Y., was started for reasons that were entirely
noncommercial but sensible nonetheless. Marya Martin, a flutist
from New Zealand who settled in Manhattan, and Ken Davidson, who
ran his own investment company, had recently married, and Davidson
was dismayed by the prospect that Ms. Martin would be spending her
summers traveling the festival circuit while he worked in the city
and spent weekends on his own in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   From what Davidson and Ms. Martin could tell, there was no great
demand for chamber music in the Hamptons; concerts they had been to
in the early 1980s were poorly attended. Nevertheless, when
Davidson flew to New Mexico to hear his wife perform at the Santa
Fe Chamber Music Festival, two weeks after their wedding, he had a
proposal. Why didn't Ms. Martin start her own festival so that they
could spend their summers together?
</P>
<P>
   As the new festival's director, Davidson raised the $15,000
budget for the first season, and as artistic director, Ms. Martin
invited three colleagues _ the violinist Ani Kavafian, the cellist
Fred Sherry and the pianist Andre-Michel Schub _ to join the
endeavor. She also persuaded the initially reluctant elders of the
Presbyterian Church to let her present her concerts in the
sanctuary of their 19th-century building.
</P>
<P>
   That first summer, the festival was really just a pair of
concerts, each a different program but both devoted entirely to
standard fare, from Telemann through Mendelssohn and Dvorak. Since
then the festival has grown slowly, and this year it has a budget
approaching $300,000, with a roster of 25 musicians who will join
forces through Aug. 25 in various combinations for six regular
programs, plus an opening benefit and a children's program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the festival, concertgoers can attend programs
offered in the Hamptons this month by two musical training
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bridgehampton Festival performances are held in a
440-seat church, the configuration of which puts everyone close to
the performers, there is a level of intimacy that the players
consider close to what has historically been the chamber music
ideal _ or at least, closer than they often find during the season,
when tours take them to all-purpose halls better suited to larger
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, much of the standard repertory, written before 1900,
was composed to be heard in even smaller spaces than the church;
composers' wealthy patrons commissioned works for semi-private
performances in their own salons and drawing rooms. On the other
hand, 20th-century chamber works, which are now a significant part
of the repertory, were composed with concert halls in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the contemporary repertory, particularly American music,
has been an increasingly important part of the programming mix at
Bridgehampton. Ms. Martin's concerts adhere to the current
programming fashion, in which diverse works are linked by common
thematic threads. So besides all-Bach and all-Mozart programs,
there is a concert called ``American Sounds,'' with works ranging
from Gershwin theater songs to Copland's Sextet and recent works by
Ned Rorem and Eric Ewazen, as well as a program called ``The South
American Soul,'' with works by Ginastera, Villa-Lobos, Nazareth and
Piazzolla. Another program, ``East Meets West,'' looks at Asian
influences on Western composers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most programatically amorphous concert _ the opening
night program, which includes Stravinsky's ``Histoire du Soldat,''
a flute transcription of the Faure Violin Sonata and a Dvorak Piano
Quartet (Op. 87) _ has a theme of sorts, the journey from
Romanticism to early modernism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juggling the programs is the tough part,'' said Ms. Martin,
who discusses ideas with her colleagues and accepts suggestions
from them, but who in the end is responsible for both the
individual programs and the shape of the festival as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I came up with another three programs I would love
to do,'' she continued, ``but which I'll have to save for another
year. In the `American Sounds' program, for example, I was going to
do a concert in which everything was related to the year 1900. Kurt
Weill was born that year, as was Aaron Copland. So was Colin
McPhee, whose `Balinese Ceremonial Music' we're including in `East
Meets West.' But then, I wanted to do the Rorem, because it's his
75th birthday, and this Eric Ewazen piece for flute, French horn
and piano is quite fantastic. So the 1900 concert will have to
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also what Ms. Martin regards as necessary compromises;
the Gershwin works on the ``American Sounds'' program, for example,
are meant as drawing cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I programmed Copland, Ewazen, Rorem and something else that
people didn't know,'' she said, ``we may not be able to sell the
house. And I've got to think of that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Martin said the all-Bach and all-Mozart programs made it
easier for her to sell the more adventurous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the Bach and Mozart concerts help give me as much
leeway as I need for the `American Sounds,' `South American Soul'
and `East Meets West' programs,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the average concertgoer to feel there is something for
them to go to, and if someone who hasn't attended the festival
before sees the series, they may buy tickets to the Mozart concert,
but they will probably then buy tickets to something else as well.
Rarely do people buy only one concert. We've found that most people
buy tickets to three.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival has been a popular draw since the beginning. When
it opened for business in 1984, Ms. Martin and Ms. Kavafian were
rehearsing backstage just before the concert when Davidson asked
them to come to the front of the church, where a long line had
formed on the path leading to the door.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is also popular among the musicians. They say that
because Bridgehampton is a small community _ and because many of
them stay at the homes of board members while they are playing at
the festival _ they have gotten to know the audience.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wonderful social scene at the festival,'' said
Sherry, the cellist who was a regular in the festival's early days.
``I don't know if people understand how important the social scene
is, among musicians. In the early days especially, it really was a
mom-and-pop festival, and everybody was involved in everything.
We'd spend the day hanging around the church, rehearsing, then we'd
all go to lunch at a coffee house, then back to rehearse some more.
Then we might practice on our own, then go to the beach, where we'd
all have picnics. It was idyllic, and the music making was very
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sherry is traveling this summer, he said he expected to
return in other seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians also say that the festival, more than many others
on the summer circuit, allows them time to perform in a far less
pressured atmosphere than they are used to during the regular
concert season.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kay, a clarinetist who is playing in all but the Bach and
Mozart concerts this summer, said: ``During the season, you're
playing chamber music but also rushing around doing 10 other
things. At Bridgehampton, the schedule keeps us pretty busy, but
it's not pressured. We have three or four days to put each program
together, and it's very collegial. We also have time to go out
after concerts, or hang out at the beach, and all that adds
pleasure to playing the concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin said she considered the church where the performances
are held to be one of the pleasures of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very New Englandy,'' she said. ``It's got a beautiful
spire, and because Long Island is so flat, if you're at all above
the tree line, you can see it. And the building is very pretty;
it's all white, white inside, with white benches and a red carpet.
And the acoustics blew me away when I first went there, years ago.
That's why we wanted to do it there.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHASING GHOSTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees aren't playing against other American
League teams anymore. For the rest of the season, they'll be
playing the ghosts of a team that existed nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees return to the Stadium on Friday with an 80-29
record, they're chasing the 1906 Chicago Cubs that won a record 116
games. To overtake those ghosts, the Yankees must win at least 37
of their final 53 games, a reasonable .698 percentage for a team
that is performing at .734.
</P>
<P>
   But who are those '06 ghosts. And how did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a person is now alive who saw those Cubs, best remembered
now for what appeared in The New York Evening Mail in 1910 when the
sportswriter Franklin Adams was told that his piece in the paper
that day was eight lines short. Quickly, he dictated:
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the saddest of possible words _
</P>
<P>
   Tinker to Evers to Chance.
</P>
<P>
   Trio of bear Cubs and fleeter than birds _
</P>
<P>
   Tinker to Evers to Chance.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtlessly pricking our gonfalon bubble,
</P>
<P>
   Making a Giant hit into a double,
</P>
<P>
   Words that are weighty with nothing but trouble _
</P>
<P>
   Tinker to Evers to Chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chance, the manager-first baseman known as the Peerless
Leader, often talked to shortstop Joe Tinker and second baseman
Johnny Evers, but the double-play combination didn't talk to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The season before, instead of waiting for any teammates to join
him in a taxi to the ball park, Evers rode off alone. Tinker
objected, they threw punches at each other, then Tinker had a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we talk, we'll be fighting all the time,'' Tinker told
Evers, ``so don't talk to me, and I won't talk to you. You play
your position and I'll play mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Tinker and Evers would be friends and be voted,
along with Chance, into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, but their
poetic connection would prompt one of baseball's favorite trivia
questions: who was the Cubs' third baseman?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is Harry Steinfeldt, who shared the National League
lead in 1906 with 83 runs batted in while hitting .327.
</P>
<P>
   In that dead-ball era, the Cubs' home run leader in 1906 was
right fielder Frank (Wildfire) Schulte with seven; he shared the
National League lead in triples with 13. Chance, who batted .319,
shared the league lead with 100 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Those Cubs served notice as early as June 7 with a 19-0 rout of
the rival New York Giants, knocking out the legendary right-hander
Christy Mathewson in an 11-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs would also win the N.L. pennant in 1907, 1908 and 1910,
as well as the World Series in 1907 and 1908 _ the last time the
Cubs did win the Series, as everyone who now inhabits Wrigley Field
knows only too well.
</P>
<P>
   Their ace in those years was Mordecai Peter Centennial Brown,
who would win 239 games as a Hall of Famer known as Three Finger
because of his mangled right hand.
</P>
<P>
   As a 7-year-old on his family's farm in Nyesville, Ind., he
reached into a feed-cutter. His index finger above the knuckle had
to be amputated; his little finger remained useless. In a fall
while chasing a hog, he later broke the third and fourth fingers.
But his deformities helped him pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a bigger dip,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1906 season, Brown had a 26-6 record with 10 shutouts
and a league-leading 1.04 earned run average. Jeff Pfiester was
20-8 and 1.56, Ed Reulbach 19-4 and 1.65, Carl Lundgren 17-6 and
2.21, Jack Taylor 12-3 and 1.83, Orval Overall 12-3 and 1.88. As a
staff, the Cubs had a 1.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   In their 116-36 record, the Cubs were a remarkable 60-15 on the
road and 56-21 at Chicago's old West Side Grounds. Sparked by a
26-3 record in August, they won 50 of their last 57 games.
</P>

   In the World Series, the Cubs suddenly soured. They lost to the
crosstown White Sox, known as the Hitless Wonders for their .230
team average in posting a 93-58 record. The White Sox batted .198
during the Series, but beat Brown twice, winning in six games as
the Cubs slumped to .196.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard Series to lose,'' Frank Chance said, ``but you
can't win all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's now a hard lesson for the Yankees to remember. They'll be
chasing the ghosts of those '06 Cubs until the end of the season,
but then they must chase the ghosts of all those Yankee teams that
have won a record 23 World Series.

LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - The chubby young woman in the midnight
blue suit steps into daylight and takes rushed strides toward
Prettyman Courthouse. Inside, she will testify for 23 grand jurors.
The thought is, the young woman bears important answers, answers to
rattle a nation. The reality is, Monica Lewinsky bears only
questions. Questions like these you rarely hear on television,
because they do not concern bodily fluids or the presidential
groin. These questions depress, perplex, frighten. By DAVID

<TEXT>
<P>
   Todor Zhivkov, the Communist ruler of Bulgaria from 1954 until
his ouster in 1989, died Wednesday night at a hospital in the
capital, Sofia. He was 86. Doctors said he died of complications
following a respiratory infection in July.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov, the longest-serving leader in the old Soviet bloc and
last prominent survivor of its old guard, was a conventional party
apparatchik. This, more than anything else, enabled him to endure
the turmoil of Balkan politics and the periodic upheavals in the
Kremlin, to which he paid fealty throughout his long career. The
only known threat to his rule was an abortive coup in 1965
organized by a handful of party dissidents and some army officers _
believed to be the first of its kind against a Communist regime.
Zhivkov said the coup was a pro-Chinese conspiracy; others
attributed it to the rigidity of his regime and his dutiful
acquiescence to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, he boasted more than any other European Communist
leader about his intimate ties with the Soviet Union, saying the
two countries `breathe with the same lungs, and the same blood
flows in our veins'' and that they were as close as ``teeth to
lip.'' This served him well through the three decades in which
Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Bloc. In the
1970s, a Bulgarian critic wrote that he had earned ``the reputation
of a Communist leader who had caused the minimum of trouble for the
Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1989 as East European regimes were collapsing
one by one, he was brought down with the blessing of the
reform-minded Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in a bloodless putsch
organized by senior officials in the Sofia government, including
the army chief of staff, who recognized that the Communist system
in which they had all grown up was doomed and that Zhivkov would be
an obstacle to transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My connection with Gorbachev became strained,'' Zhivkov
acknowledged in a 1993 interview with Henry Kamm of The New York
Times. ``I entered into a conflict with him and he and his helpers
organized my release,'' he said, using the traditional Communist
euphemism ``release'' for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Zhivkov authorized a forced assimilation drive
against Bulgaria's 1 million ethnic Turks in which more than 100
were killed and 310,000 forcibly expelled. In a campaign that
aroused international condemnation, ethnic Turks were deprived of
linguistic, cultural and religious rights. They were dismissed from
jobs and rounded up at night, trucked to police stations and forced
to change their Islamic Turkish names into Slavic names. In
1988-89, hundreds of thousands jammed borders in forced flight to
neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He was responsible for the construction in 1959 of concentration
camps for political prisoners just as the Soviet Union was
dismantling Stalin's gulags. He was also said to be behind the
murder in London in 1978 of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer in
exile who had made mocking broadcasts about Zhivkov for Radio Free
Europe. In one of the strangest assassinations of the Cold War,
Markov was killed on Waterloo Bridge by an agent who used a special
umbrella to shoot a poisoned pellet into his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Zhivkov's actions paralleled those of other Soviet Bloc
leaders: brutal collectivization of farmlands; the installation of
nuclear power reactors that had a Chernobyl disaster potential; the
opening of a huge steel factory that polluted the air of the valley
of the Isker, including the nearby capital of Sofia. His legacy for
his country of 9 million included a foreign debt of $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhivkov-era concentration camps were at Kotsian, Bogdanov
Dol, Belene Island in the Danube and Lovech. As many as 1,000
prisoners were held in Lovech from 1959 to its closing in 1962 and
at least 100 died or were killed there, according to the Interior
Ministry. Disclosures of their existence came in 1990 a few months
after Zhivkov was ousted. A Ministry of Interior spokesman said,
``Todor Zhivkov at least knew or gave the orders. The problem is
that from this period there were few material traces. It was done
on the telephone.'' Or, as Zhivkov boasted in 1991: ``You won't
find Todor Zhivkov's name where the things were done.''
</P>
<P>
   He was never tried for political crimes; prosecutors concluded
it would be too difficult to make charges stick. Instead he was
tried on charges of illegally spending the equivalent of $24
million in state funds. In 1992, after a trial that lasted 18
months, during which he was scornful and defiant, he was convicted
of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison. Apparently,
the post-Zhivkov government, which included many of his former
associates, was reluctant to rake over the coals of their mutual
past.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to his heart problems and age the middle-sized man
with the long thin nose and the heavy jowls was allowed to serve
his time under house arrest at the mountain slope home of his
granddaughter overlooking Sofia, and even to make a foray to his
birthplace in Pravets, 44 miles northeast of the capital. On that
occasion he bragged, ``The whole country loves me.'' In February
1996, Bulgaria's highest court acquitted him of the embezzlement
charges though he remained under indictment on charges that he
abused human rights.

</P>
<P>
   Todor Zhivkov was born Sept. 7, 1911, in Pravets, a farm village
in the foothills of the Balkan Mountains. He was one of a
generation of Balkan Communists who were raised in poverty, got
some education, imbibed the militant Marxism of Stalin in the 1930s
and took power after World War II. His father and mother, Hristo
and Maroutsa, had grown up poor, and young Todor had to leave
school after finishing the sixth grade. He was accepted in the
Secondary School of Book Printing and Graphic Arts in Sofia in 1929
and became acquainted through it with the rigid Communists of the
printing trade. Within a year he was accepted in the Bulgarian
Young Communist League. From there he moved steadily forward in the
Communist Party apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Bulgaria aligned itself with the Axis powers. After the
Russians defeated the Germans at Stalingrad, the Bulgarian
Communist Party organized guerrilla movements in Bulgaria and
Zhivkov, still in his mid-30s, participated as a political
commissar of a guerrilla detachment.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1944 the Soviet army swept into Bulgaria, the
country's pro-German government was ousted and a Fatherland Front
coalition of anti-fascists was created by the Soviet occupation
force. The Bulgarian Communist Party, which numbered about 8,000 in
September 1944, became the dominant force of the Fatherland Front
and set about killing off its political opponents _ agrarians,
social democrats and monarchists _ in addition to fascists. In
Sofia alone, 2,138 death sentences were passed, marking perhaps the
bloodiest of all Communist takeovers in Soviet-occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov was credited with playing an important role in the
seizure of power as chief of the newly established Peoples Militia
with the rank of colonel. His ``Biographical Sketch'' published in
1981 in Sofia tells that ``under the direct leadership of Todor
Zhivkov,'' an armed force of Communists rounded up ``the most
reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie hiding in the villas'' at
the end of September 1944. He also wrote the orders ``to catch the
intellectual and physical murderers of the fighters for national
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the central committee of the party six months
later and as a senior official in its organizational bureau,
presided over the expansion of the party to 460,000 members. In
this capacity he also served in the autumn of 1949 as an
interrogator of Traicho Kostov, the wartime secretary of the party,
in preparation for his Stalinist show trial on charges of
collaborating with Yugoslavia's maverick Tito regime and opposing
Soviet domination. Kostov was tortured before his brief trial and
then executed.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov had been elevated to full membership in the party's
governing Politburo in 1951 in the brief era of Vulko Chervenkov,
who like his famous predecessor and brother-in-law, Georgi
Dimitrov, had spent the war years in Moscow under Stalin's thumb in
the Comintern. Then, after the death of Stalin in 1953, Nikita S.
Khrushchev ascended to power in Moscow and began replacing the
``Muscovite'' lieutenants sent out to run the Soviet satellites
with ``home Communists.'' Zhivkov's hour had arrived and he was
installed as first secretary of the party in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks following Khrushchev's epochal denunciation in
February 1956 of the crimes of Stalin, Zhivkov spoke gingerly
before his own party about the 1949 Bulgarian purge without
mentioning Kostov by name. With Bulgaria's best-known Stalinists
already relegated to the backwaters, he said only that ``innocent
comrades were accused and unjustly punished.'' He did not mention
his own role in the Kostov case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, with the backing of Khrushchev, Zhivkov added the post
of prime minister. Then, following a pattern set in other Bloc
countries he became chairman of a newly established Council of
State in 1971, the equivalent of president in other countries,
while retaining his grip on the party. His speech, according to
Georgi Markov, the writer murdered in 1978, who met him in these
years, ``frequently showed the uneasy combination of simple peasant
language and pompous phrases.'' But Markov credited him with
``natural intelligence, quick wit and a magnificent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time confident in his durability, Zhivkov began
publishing the first of 38 volumes of ``Works,'' mainly the
seemingly interminable speeches that party leaders of his era were
accustomed to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, at the height of his power, he turned his
birthplace of Pravets into a model town, reached from Sofia by a
rare four-lane highway. The house where he was born was opened as a
historical monument. In addition, Pravets got a ``historical''
museum chronicling his, and Communist Bulgaria's life, and a
factory where Bulgaria's first computer, the ``Pravets,'' was
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   After Zhivkov's political demise, the Pravets memorials went the
way of so many other Communist monuments across the bloc. The
Zhivkov home was empty, the museum closed. But when Zhivkov visited
the town in 1995, he was handed the deed to the eight acres of
farmland owned by his father, collectivized by the son in the 1950s
and now returned to his private hands. A circle had been closed.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years, Zhivkov gave occasional interviews to
foreign media, ruminating on his career and reinventing history
somewhat by portraying himself as a Soviet bloc visionary who had
seen that technological and economic advance was essential, and
that the ailing Brezhnev should have relinquished power years
before he died in November 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He was largely ignored by Bulgarians themselves. As
post-communist misery grew, however, so did nostalgia for the
seeming stability and prosperity of the Zhivkov era. Early this
year, Zhivkov, who had been stripped of his Communist Party
membership, was suddenly reinstated as a member of the Socialist
Party, which succeeded the old Communists, and even inspired a
rousing ovation at a Sofia rally.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivkov married Dr. Mara Maleeva, a physician, in 1938. She died
in 1971. Their daughter Lyudmila, who, under her father's tutelage
became minister of culture at age 32 in 1975 and encouraged modern
art and published works by authors like Allen Ginsberg, died under
mysterious circumstances six years later. Some suspected that her
death in a bathtub at her father's official residence was a
suicide, others that she was killed by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A son, Vladimir, and two grandchildren survive.

NRA UNVEILS MUSEUM THAT TELLS `THE STORY OF AMERICANS AND THEIR
GUNS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ In a time when many Americans consider guns a
terrifying societal menace, a new museum near the nation's capital
hopes to entice tourists with a $3.1 million high-tech tribute to
American firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 guns _ from Napoleon's ornately decorated rifle to
a standard Army-issue M-16 used in the Persian Gulf War _ line the
walls of the National Rifle Association's National Firearms Museum.
The 15,000-square-foot display is housed in the NRA's headquarters
in Fairfax, a Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Its message is unmistakable: Guns are as American as apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms and American history are intertwined,'' said Doug
Wickland, the curator. ``We like to think of the National Firearms
Museum as being the story of Americans and their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   There are sections on presidents and guns, police and guns,
noted military leaders and guns, even children and guns.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's ``For the Fun of It'' gallery, dedicated to youth,
includes a ``typical'' boy's bedroom from the 1950s, complete with
a gun rack for BB guns and other weaponry. The floor is covered
with an authentic Hopalong Cassidy rug that was salvaged from a New
Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall is another relic of the past, a
turn-of-the-century Coney Island shooting gallery, from the days
when fairgoers fired real .22 caliber rifles at moving metal ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which is free and open to the public daily, attracts
a combination of gun enthusiasts, history buffs and curious
tourists drawn by signs along nearby Interstate 66. Attendance has
averaged more than 100 visitors a day since the facility opened in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one fellow who drove six hours to see this,'' said
Wickland, gesturing toward the museum's Wall of Winchesters, a
collection of 72 Winchester rifles. ``He spent two days looking at
it, and he left here a very, very happy individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given the topic, not everyone gives the museum rave
reviews. Guns may have been a necessity in Colonial times, but
they're an emotional political issue today, when flintlocks have
evolved into semiautomatic assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking back on a sepia-tone past when the theme in a
kid's room wasn't sports, but guns. It is, to them, a vision of a
sort of lost Valhalla,'' said Josh Sugarmann, executive director of
the Violence Policy Center, one of the NRA's political enemies.
``Most people have a very different view of American youth's gun
culture. What they're doing is fighting against what people see in
the newspapers every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In a coincidence that underscored the conflicting views, the
museum hosted a media open house Thursday at the very moment that
President Clinton was in the White House Rose Garden urging
Congress to retain a waiting period for handgun purchases. The
five-day waiting period required by the 1994 Brady law is set to
expire Nov. 30, and Clinton wants to keep a minimum three-day wait
for handgun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the NRA's leading role in opposing gun control, the only
overtly political items at the organization's museum are in the
gift shop. Visitors can stock up on NRA pens, lighters, flags,
pins, belt buckles, caps, shot glasses, mugs and T-shirts declaring
``Armed with Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a commemorative plate depicting Charlton Heston,
the organization's president, and the words to the Second Amendment
proclaiming the right to bear arms. Souvenirs for children include
stuffed animals, backpacks, trading cards and lunch boxes featuring
Eddie Eagle, the organization's mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the museum's climate-controlled display cases, politics
takes a backseat to history. Life-size dioramas show a Colonial
hunter in action, a St. Louis gunsmith's shop in the 1800s and
scenes from World War I and World War II. The exhibits are
supplemented by computers that can provide additional information
on specific items.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive firearms collection includes a rifle that came to
Plymouth Colony on the Mayflower, a musket that is believed to have
been used at the battle of Lexington and Concord in 1775, an air
rifle that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark used to impress
Indians on their storied 1804-1806 expedition across the West to
the Pacific Ocean, and a pistol that President Theodore Roosevelt
kept in a nightstand at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable weapons is a tiny flintlock pistol
that weighs less than an ounce and fires a .08 inch ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing periods where firearms were viewed in different
ways,'' Wickland said. ``This is an historical museum as opposed to
a political statement of any kind.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: FREEDOM FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On July 21 Iran hanged a citizen who follows the small faith of
Bahai, on the charge of trying to convert a man who follows the
huge faith of Islam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other Iranian Bahais have been sentenced for the same
crime; seven are scheduled for hanging. The execution got four
paragraphs in The New York Times; other papers gave zero. The State
Department condemned the execution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But next to the story of the hanging was another, continued from
the front page. Headline: ``Senate Drops Bill Punishing Lands That
Persecute Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the administration have been campaigning
month after month to kill that bill _ the Freedom From Persecution
Act. It would put a consistent spotlight on religious persecution
and what the president does or refuses to do about it. He cannot
abide the thought; it prevents what he calls ``fudging.''
</P>
<P>
   Persecution. That's blood, fetters, death, wherever, and to
whatever religious minorities _ in the Iran of the ayatollahs, in
the China of the Communist Politburo where Catholics and
Protestants who wish to worship as their faith dictates have to
risk their freedom and worship underground, in Pakistan where
Christians by the scores have been imprisoned for ``blasphemy''
against Islam, in Tibet where pictures of the Dalai Lama are
displayed only on pain of prison, or in the Sudan where Christians
and members of ancient African faiths are massacred by the Islamist
government.
</P>
<P>
   The president and foreign trade lobbies, working tight together,
think they killed the bill in the Senate after it passed the House
of Representatives 375 to 41.
</P>
<P>
   The determination, money and fury of the president and the
trade-uber-alles lobbies arise from the whole bill, but
particularly that spotlight: a permanent commission, appointed or
approved by Congress. It would name persecutors and suggest
punishment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The punishment list ranges from cutting state visits to ending
loans. The president could waive them, and this president would.
But he could not waive responsibility for his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Republicans joined with Democrats to block a Senate
committee vote. The next step would have been a vote by the full
Senate, where the bill would have won, maybe with enough votes to
override Clinton's threatened veto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But here is some news for the president and the religiously
persecuted: The bill is alive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is on vacation, but supporters of the bill still
work, trying to get language that would satisfy fence-sitters. I
would have preferred a bill including trade sanctions. But I have
learned following this bill closely how hard it is to get any human
rights legislation through a Congress where most Democrats obey
Clinton and so many Democrats and Republicans kneel to trade
lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for the bill will continue fiercely when the Senate
meets from the end of August until its adjournment about a month
later. Supporters of the bill say that if a vote is blocked they
will kill the extra $18 billion for the International Monetary
Fund. That is a warning to senators who block an anti-persecution
vote because their states sell grain to countries that get great
gobs of American money via the IMF. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time has been wasted and is tight. Much will depend on the skill
and push of Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. He has responsibility for
guiding it through the Senate. If political trickery blocks a vote
in committee, the majority leader, Trent Lott, promises to get a
full Senate vote anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes all religious minorities. But opponents say
the spotlight will focus particularly on Christians. Since
Christians are the most numerous right now, that's just fine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Cardinal O'Connor of New York supports an anti-persecution
bill, and so do clergy around the country. So does a coalition of
conservatives and liberals, Christians and Jews, organizational or
individual, religious or civic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Religious and secular human rights strengthen each other _ no
country exists free with just one or the other.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans work and pray for anti-persecution
legislation. On Election Day they will remember who voted how in
Congress.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They all are answering for themselves three questions put by
Rabbi Hillel almost 2,000 years ago. They hang on a lot of walls,
including mine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am only for myself,
what am I? If not now, when?''

COMMENTARY: A SHUDDER OF DISGUST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a picture of the White House lawyer Lanny Breuer leaving
the courthouse Tuesday with his lawyer Mark Lynch. But where is
Lynch's lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   The editor must have cropped him out of the picture. It's hard
to conceive that a lawyer for a White House lawyer would show up at
a courthouse these days without a lawyer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Law is on a hair-raising tear this summer. Make a move without a
lawyer, and you can end up on TV looking guiltier than Count
Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   The law is now engaged in a prodigious power grab. Unless it is
stopped people without lawyers may soon find themselves under
subpoena to explain why they refuse to salute the billable hour.
</P>
<P>
   A coup by the law itself? Quite possibly. It started at the
White House when everybody not anointed by Blackstone was put out
of the scandal loop, including the press secretary, whose task is
to keep the seething masses up to date on the democratic saga.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers _ advised no doubt by their own lawyers _
have raised the infamous old White House stone wall against
universal public enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   This naturally maddens the federal judiciary. Off and on through
history, federal judges have assumed they are better qualified than
presidents and Congress to steer the Republic. We are apparently in
such an era right now.
</P>
<P>
   When the courts finish authorizing Kenneth Starr to strip
Clinton down to his bones and then to his DNA, the supremacy of the
courts will be so well established that none but saints and fools
will want to be president again.
</P>
<P>
   And who will ever again want to become a journalist? Imagine,
mother: Do you want that lovely little child of yours to grow up
and spend a long malodorous life writing stories that make you
shudder with disgust?
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate journalists Woodward and Bernstein inspired a
whole generation of young people to think of journalism as an
honorable way to spend a life. That is the generation that's now
trying to look solemn instead of leering and winking as it issues
the daily bulletins on ladies' dirty linen.
</P>
<P>
   These wretched media people know it's filthy work, but somebody,
they say, has to do it, just as somebody has to clean septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   What pious baloney. Sanitary engineering is a noble career
because it's vital to world health; taste-free journalism makes you
wince with shame for what ought to an honorable calling. If you'd
be embarrassed to have your children read what you write or watch
you say it on the tube, you'd urge them not to follow in the
parental footsteps, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about this endless business is that there is
absolutely nobody to root for. Polls show the public is sympathetic
to the president, but thinks him a liar.
</P>
<P>
   The softest judgment about him might be that he is a foolish
philanderer and incurable finagler who needs counseling rather than
impeaching.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd conduct of Monica Lewinsky can be put down to the
callowness of youth and a hopeless ignorance of the hazards of
Washington, but her famous photo with Old Glory disclosed a
stunning insensitivity to life's exigencies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp. It's tempting to call her ``poor Linda Tripp.''
Poor because her betrayal of Lewinsky's trust was despicable, and
because she wants to believe it wasn't, and because satirists make
fun of her physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The old folks used to explain why such people deserved no tears
by saying, ``She made her bed, let her lie in it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kenneth Starr, even those who root for him wish he were
more like Spencer Tracy than Charles Laughton. The White House
counterattack has damaged him by comparing him to Inspector Javert
(played by Charles Laughton) in ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   I once heard a woman sum up the plot of this immense novel in 14
words: ``A man steals a loaf of bread and never hears the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With slight changes the line could be applied to the Starr
attempt to get something on the president that will justify his
years of investigation. You'd have to hate Clinton with a fury to
root for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Some people probably do. Sensitive people will be content to
loathe them all quietly for what they have done to the country, for
how they have debased our culture.

JUDGE ORDERS GATES TO BE AVAILABLE FOR UNLIMITED QUESTIONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting Microsoft's argument that Bill Gates is
too busy to be interrogated by government lawyers for more than a
day, a federal judge Thursday ordered the company chairman and
chief executive officer to make himself available for unlimited
questioning about the company's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also ordered Microsoft to make
available 16 other company employees the government wants to
question. And Jackson refused to take any additional measures to
protect the secrecy of the code for Windows 95 and Windows 98,
which the company must release under seal to the government.
</P>
<P>
   During a 19-minute hearing before Jackson, Microsoft said that
on Monday it will file a motion asking the judge to dismiss the
anti-trust cases brought against the company by the Justice
Department, 20 state attorneys general and the District of
Columbia. The cases accuse Microsoft of illegal anti-competitive
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who ruled against Microsoft in every motion he
considered Thursday, made it clear that he will look skeptically on
any motion to dismiss the case. The judge said that if there is
even one factual dispute between the government and the company, he
can not dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorney John Warden cited two reasons for dismissing
the case.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, a federal appeals court overturned a preliminary
injunction Jackson had issued prohibiting Microsoft from requiring
computer manufacturers who license the Windows operating system to
also license its Internet Explorer browser. Warden said that
appeals court's decision, which found that ``integration brings
benefits,'' undermines the government's current case which argues
that integration of the browser into the operating system
constitutes a violation of anti-trust law..
</P>
<P>
   Warden also said that recent depositions of executives from
other companies has turned up no evidence that Microsoft's
practices have ``had the effect of foreclosing access to the market
on the part of anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the court can resolve this case now, without the
need for an expensive and time-consuming trial,'' William Neukom,
Microsoft senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, said
after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the special trial counsel hired by the federal
government to prosecute Microsoft, shrugged off Microsoft's plan to
seek dismissal of the case, saying ``every defendant wants to file
a motion for summary judgment.'' Boies said the court of appeals
decision does not significantly undermine the current case, and he
said Microsoft's description of the information gathered about
market impact is ``not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing was one of numerous steps along the way from
the filing of the cases against Microsoft on May 18 to the
scheduled beginning of the trial Sept. 8. Over the coming weeks,
the parties must file various briefs and depose numerous witnesses,
and Jackson is likely to hold other hearings to mediate disputes
and to consider any motions that are filed.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Gates will be deposed starting Wednesday at
an undisclosed location in the Seattle area. The government said it
expects to need no more than two days to question Gates, but
Jackson said he would not impose limits on the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am well aware that a deposition can be abused by both the
interrogator and the deponent,'' Jackson said, before offering to
personally supervise the Gates deposition in his courtroom. His
offer was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the deposition of Gates should ``continue from day
to day as long as is necessary, or until it appears to me that the
deponent (Gates) is entitled to be excused.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had sought to limit the number of executives
questioned, as well as the length of time Gates is questioned,
saying that the Justice Department already has deposed 12 Microsoft
executives, waited until the last-minute to seek a new round of
depositions, and might be trying to distract the company from
preparing for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had also sought a special agreement to protect the
confidentiality of the source code for Windows 95 and Windows 98,
which the government wants to examine as part of its preparation
for trial. Jackson said he has already issued an order to protect
the confidentiality of that code.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am perfectly prepared to impose every penalty in my power''
if the code is leaked, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the various warring companies affected by the case
have shown some recent ability to get along in preparation for the
September trial. After Microsoft filed a motion in federal court in
Utah complaining about a lack of cooperation from Novell, that
company began cooperating, and Microsoft said yesterday that its
arch-competitor, Netscape Communications Corp., has been answering
Microsoft's pre-trial questions ``in a very cooperative fashion.''

   BOEING-PRODUCTION (Seattle) The Boeing Co. will announce next
week it is sending next-generation 737 assembly work to its
underused Long Beach, California aircraft factory _ marking the
first time in Boeing's history that the company has shipped
airplane production work outside the Puget Sound area, people
familiar with the decision said yesterday. The company's largest
union has fought to keep the work in Washington but its counterpart
in California welcomed the decision. California officials bent over
backwards to get Boeing to bring the work south, offering tax
credits for each job saved. The plan is not expected to affect
employment in the Puget Sound area.

LEWINSKY FOLLY POSES QUESTIONS OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The chubby young woman in the midnight blue suit steps
into daylight and takes rushed strides toward Prettyman Courthouse.
Inside, she will testify for 23 grand jurors. The thought is, the
young woman bears important answers, answers to rattle a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, Monica Lewinsky bears only questions.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to lurk in the space between her white-shoed
footsteps, in the few bustling moments it takes for the witness to
cross the mobbed sidewalk to a side door. Questions like these you
rarely hear on television, because they do not concern bodily
fluids or the Presidential groin. These questions depress, perplex,
frighten. They beg you to change the channel. Oh, if only.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing else is on. Nothing but questions.
</P>
<P>
   How did we fall so far? Just 209 years have elapsed since
Washington's oath of office. The line of succession stretches for
only 41 men. An historical eye-blink this represents, a hiccup, but
time enough to shift a country's eyes from the balcony of Federal
Hall on Wall Street to a grand jury room in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it end? The viewer shuts his eyes, tries to replace
the sight of the witness with an image of government clean,
government worthy. There is a flicker: Early in college, a long
drive to Washington, a teenage goof from 15 years ago. At the
Library of Congress, the Great Hall stole my breath like a fist to
the solar plexus. The quotation from Francis Bacon was inscribed at
the head of a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is power.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three words caution, but also speak to an ideal. Thinking
men had those three words chiseled in place as a statement of
purpose, of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from the TV set on the office wall, the voice of CNN's
forensic scientist rises in impeccable counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she says, ``there are certain things which definitely
can compromise the biological evidence, such as heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon would have wept at the edge of the 21st century. Knowledge
now is tears.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it: The machinery of government, of the justice system,
of the press, all working full throttle to determine if a young
woman sank to her knees before the President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his first inaugural address, on a Wednesday morning 197 years
ago, Thomas Jefferson spoke of ``equal and exact justice to all
men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political.''
</P>
<P>
   How did we get from that line of stark beauty to Kenneth Starr?
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, from Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the
Declaration of Independence at 33, to William Jefferson Clinton,
who appears to prefer interns who are 23?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom currently favors a ``mea culpa''
scenario: Clinton lashing himself before the American public,
confessing, apologizing, explaining, banking on mercy. The pundits
say this will beget a redefinition, and allow the public to see
Clinton anew.
</P>
<P>
   One more symptom of the fall: Now the truth is worth telling
only as strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Apology or no, Clinton, his recent peers and 25 years of
partisan zealots from both parties have already redefined
something: the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson wrote of ``exact justice.'' John Adams took a stand:
Virtue, he said, outranked honor ``in the scale of moral
excellence.'' As a boy, George Washington had a rule in his copy
book: ``Labour to keep alive in your breast that little spark of
celestial fire _ conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's most memorable famous oration to date: ``I did
not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the signature statement of the modern presidency, with all
its legacies: an 18-1/2 minute gap in a tape; smuggled guns and
contras; subpoenas, White House coffees and DNA on a dress.
</P>
<P>
   How did we fall so far?
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the young woman again steps into daylight. Cameras
fire, men scramble. She has answered everything, and answered
absolutely nothing. &QL;

RETAIL SALES IN JULY IS STRONGEST IN FIVE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took retailers more than a year to catch up with
the stellar American economy, and now, as growth slows slightly and
the stock market behaves erratically, shoppers are showing no signs
of slowing their spending.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers Thursday reported the strongest July same-store sales
in five years, a result of robust demand for clothing and
housewares. The figures resumed a trend that began with a 10.2
percent gain in April and a 7.1 percent rise in May. Sales stumbled
slightly in June, increasing 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.'s retail composite index rose 4.8 percent
last month, compared with figures from the month a year earlier,
the best July gain since 1993, when sales rose 5.4 percent.
Same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, are
considered the best measure of a retailer's health.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by hot weather, shoppers filled their carts with
ceiling fans, bathing suits, spiral notebooks and planting soil _
indeed nearly every category of merchandise flew off the shelves,
much of it at full price.
</P>
<P>
   Strong leading economic indicators combined to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our key indicators are flashing green,'' said Richard N.
Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ``Real wage growth was up
in June, the most recent month, 3.2 percent, which is the strongest
in 25 years. Real personal consumption expenditures were up 5.3
percent in June, and you'd have to go back to about 1983 to find
the last time that number was over 5 percent. And housing turnover,
which is a key indicator of sales of home-related products, was
running up 14.7 percent in June.''
</P>
<P>
   The big winners were specialty apparel stores, which for years
lagged behind the rest of the industry as consumers stocked up on
basic casual clothes that have become the staple of the American
wardrobe. The church of basics, Gap Inc., reported sales gains of
19 percent, with strong performances in all of its divisions, which
include Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialty stores showed similar gains. Limited Inc. said
same-store sales were up 7 percent, and Ann Taylor Stores reported
same-store sales gains of 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among merchants of off-price clothing, which has been extremely
popular with shoppers for more than two years, the story was the
same. Ross Stores reported gains of 7 percent, the TJX Co. said its
sales rose 9 percent and Value City reported gains of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lengthy period when apparel underperformed,'' Baum
said. ``So there was some pent-up demand, and we are still seeing
some residual of that. And there are favorable demographics:
Teen-agers are the fastest growing group, and they spend a lot of
money on clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong apparel sales only made weaker players stand out
more. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. said its sales rose a mere 1.7 percent,
mostly because of a weakness in their apparel department. At the
J.C. Penney Co., sales fell 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, department store results were mixed. Kohl's,
which sells less expensive merchandise, said sales rose 10.4
percent, and Saks Holdings said sales rose 9.9 percent. But Dillard
Department Stores reported a sales decline of 2 percent, and
Mervyn's, a unit of Dayton Hudson, said sales fell 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores are likely to continue feeling the squeeze
from the off-price shops, as are discounters, where apparel
accounts for about one-third of their merchandise. Wal-Mart Stores
said its sales rose 7.1 percent, compared with figures in the month
a year earlier, while Target, another Dayton Hudson unit, reported
a 6.7 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   All these strong sales bode well for profits. ``Most retailers
are entering the third fiscal quarter with very clean inventories
and the wind at their backs,'' Baum said. ``They ought to have
really good second-quarter earnings.'' &QL;

 &HT;    FINALLY, D-DAY ARRIVES AT 'MONICA BEACH'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Hancock plunged into the media madness,
holding up a bright yellow sign reading ``Good Luck Monica'' as the
star witness entered the courthouse Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this shot for seven months and this
clown comes by and (ruins it),'' complained a television cameraman.
He described how the tourist from Bowling Green, Ky., popped up in
front of a row of photographers just as Monica Lewinsky was whisked
in a side entrance to begin her long-awaited testimony before a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance amounted to D-Day at ``Monica Beach'' _
the name journalists have given the sun-drenched sidewalks and
plazas around E. Everett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. Inside,
independent counsel Kenneth Starr is conducting his investigation
into whether President Clinton had a sexual affair with the former
White House intern and engaged in an illegal cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of reporters and technicians equipped with the tools of
their trade _ satellite trucks, cameras, microphones, tape
recorders, notepads, gall and gigantic egos _ chronicled the
fleeting arrival and departure of the witness. In between, they
filled long hours of emptiness when she was testifying inside in
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Cooled by electric fans and shaded by canopies, TV
correspondents somberly informed their viewers of the momentous but
unseen goings-on in the familiar building behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is the biggest day so far,'' explained CNN
correspondent Bob Franken, who said the courthouse has become ``my
home away from home.'' The broadcast networks and cable news
channels have occupied the same strategic positions almost since
``Day One'' in January, he said, noting the places ``are marked
with gaffers tape'' similar ``to the way a dog stakes out his
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, though, regulars like Franken were reinforced by
news crews from Court TV and Inside Edition and around the world,
all anxious to report on the big development _ Monica Talks!
</P>
<P>
   ``There is massive interest in the story,'' said Jonathan Hunt,
a correspondent for Sky News, a 24-hour news channel in England.
``It's a mixture of sex and politics, and that's a combination that
has brought down a lot of leaders in the U.K.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest is both ``salacious and serious,'' he explained,
because ``whatever happens to the president has a big impact'' on
financial markets and governments.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, the media circus moved across town to the
sidewalk outside the offices of Lewinsky's attorney as Judy Smith,
a spokeswoman for the witness, summed up her testimony. ``She
answered completely and truthfully and honestly each and every
question posed to her by the Office of Independent Counsel and
members of the grand jury,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what was she wearing?'' wondered a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard blue,'' said a companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duh,'' rejoined the woman, eliciting giggles from those who
knew of the blue cocktail dress being tested by the FBI for
evidence of a liaison between Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the journalists at the courthouse were scores of
tourists who stopped by hoping for a glimpse of the witness _ who
indeed wore a blue suit, pearls and white shoes for her testimony _
but mostly settling for a behind-the-scenes look at the media
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spectacle,'' said Larry Hause, who was touring
Washington with his family from Louisville, Ky. ``This is history
in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, we'd better watch what we say,'' cautioned his
9-year-old daughter, Tracy, as she looked warily at the microphones
and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Walterbach, a visitor from St. Louis, arrived early
enough to get a snapshot of Lewinsky entering the building. ``She
had a smile on her face,'' she said. ``I feel sorry for her. That's
a pretty big person to go up against.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three children aged 16, 11 and 7, Walterbach said
she was saddened by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, ``every kid wants to grow up to be president,''
she said. ``Now, with younger kids, how do you explain what's been
going on? Did he lie? What about?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Penati, a visitor from Milan, said nobody would make a
big deal if the president had an affair in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex _ we do it and enjoy it and that's it,'' he said, before
opining that ``if justice was obstructed, then sure, that's a big
deal'' and wondering about the alleged evidence on Lewinsky's blue
dress.
</P>
<P>
   So how does he know so much about a case that wouldn't be a big
deal in his country?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's on television in Italy, too,'' he admitted. ``It's
very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a wheelchair, Lillie Smith of Manassas, Va., held a
sign that said ``No Matter What Clinton Says or Does, No Matter Who
Supports Him, There Is A Vile Stain on the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the president's day of reckoning is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can lie to the nation, but he can't lie to God,'' she said.
``God knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hancock repeatedly explained why he had brought the
sign that caused such anguish among some cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame this entire circus on a 25-year-old girl,''
said Hancock. ``For the White House and the American media to put
it all on her like she was a sorceress or something is just plain
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For his show of support, ``I got jostled pretty good. My mom got
so scared she gave me her sign,'' said Hancock, who recovered
quickly enough to give interviews to the journalistic hordes
desperate to hear from anyone who witnessed Lewinsky's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5:20 p.m., Lewinsky left the courthouse as quickly and
silently as she had arrived. She will be likely be back and,
certainly, so will her watchers on Monica Beach.

TOURIST BOAT HITS, PRESUMABLY KILLS, WHALE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A high-speed whale-watching boat struck and seriously
injured an endangered humpback whale last Sunday 20 miles east of
Boston, prompting a federal investigation and a search for the
missing animal, which has not been seen for days.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger on the boat, Peggy Kornegger of Somerville, called
the collision ``a chilling experience few of us on that boat will
forget. The woman next to me was sobbing uncontrollably after the
boat hit the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists consider the increasing popularity of
whale-watching a threat to the whales and pushed unsuccessfully a
few years ago for federal rules that limit how close the boats may
get. But Thursday whale-watch officials said Sunday's collision was
both rare and unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, it was almost like something jumping between
two parked cars. It just came up very quickly,'' said Rick Nolan of
Boston Harbor Cruises, which operates the double-hulled catamaran
Millennium that struck the whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had contact'' with a whale in 18
years of whale-watching, said Nolan, the company's managing
partner, ``We feel awful about it. We just hope the whale is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But passenger Kornegger wrote in a letter to the Globe that the
Millennium was going too fast because ``the captain was obviously
starting his rush back to Boston to keep the trip within the
allotted three hours.'' She said such ``quickie'' whale excursions
put the animals at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Humpbacks, which range in size from 30 to 60 feet, are among the
most popular whales because of their spectacular breaches where
they leap out of the water, exposing most of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service, which
enforces laws protecting marine mammals, praised Boston Harbor
Cruises for reporting the collision promptly, but, even if the
collision was an accident, it may have violated the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an endangered species, if you cause injury, there's the
possibility you could be cited,'' said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium, which doubles as a commuter boat on weekdays,
was accelerating for the trip back from the whale-watching ground
at Stellwagen Bank when the captain saw a whale spouting between
the two hulls of the catamaran, Nolan said. The captain tried to go
into reverse, but the boat was going 18.3 miles an hour, less than
half the maximum speed, and struck the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Cetacean Research Unit, a private group based
in Gloucester that provides naturalists for whale-watching tours,
saw the whale a couple hours after the 12:30 p.m. accident, noting
a deep gash near its dorsal fin that Nolan described as ``a pretty
significant wound.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the whale has not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Shorr, spokeswoman for the Center for Coastal Studies in
Provincetown, said her research group is concerned generally about
the new fast catamarans that ply the waters off New England. But
she said whale-watch boats are generally safer for whales than
other boats because their captians observe strict speed limits and
other procedures when whales are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Collisions with boats are a major hazard for whales, Shorr said,
but ``in general, whale-watch boats are not the big offender.''

HOUSE WORKS TO WRAP UP LAST-MINUTE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded Thursday that
the GOP would probably achieve only a modest tax cut before the
November elections, as the battle lines for the congressional
campaign hardened around the issues of Social Security and tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prepared to break for the August recess Thursday,
Democrats said any projected budget surplus must be used to fund a
long-term solution that guarantees the solvency of the Social
Security system before any tax cuts are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans asserted they could achieve both goals at the same
time, while Democrats contended that most of the GOP's proposed
$702 billion in tax cuts would be financed with revenues from the
Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   As Gingrich urged Republican House members to tout the proposed
tax cut to their constituents during the monthlong recess, he
acknowledged it was not likely to be approved this year. Moderate
Republicans in the Senate have vowed to block a large tax cut, and
Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill are determined to delay a
tax cut until a solution is reached on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the president will sign a $700 billion tax cut
this year,'' Gingrich told reporters Thursday. ``I mean, I
understand that, so we're not going to get all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich privately has told Republican lawmakers that a more
modest tax cut of $70 billion to $80 billion over five years is the
most they could expect from Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides view a tax cut as the defining issue for the fall
congressional campaigns because it shows the sharp differences
between the two parties at a time when a swing of 11 seats could
cost the Republicans control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put Social Security first. Republicans want to put
saving Social Security second,'' said House minority leader Richard
Gephardt at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday to
resist the call for tax cuts because the political appeal of saving
Social Security would prove to be an effective counterweight with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Clinton told reporters, ``I was disappointed today when
the speaker proposed to drain $700 billion from the surplus before
we have realized the surplus and before we take even the first step
to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, fortified by public opinion polls, are
convinced that tax cuts remain the most powerful issue for them in
the fall. But fearful that Democrats will put them on the defensive
as they did on Medicare two years ago, Gingrich did not mention tax
cuts in the same sentence without also pledging to ``save'' Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to saving Social Security, providing tax
relief and continuing economic growth,'' said Gingrich in remarks
to House Republicans Thursday. ``I think the choice over the next
few months is going to be very straightforward. Our friends on the
left are going to argue basically for higher taxes. If you oppose
tax relief, you're arguing for higher taxes. Let's be fair about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they favor tax reduction as well but not until
the issue of funding Social Security benefits for the baby boomers
is resolved. The pay-as-you-go Social Security system now acts as a
massive income transfer between workers and retirees. But
demographic trends show there will not be enough workers to pay the
retirement benefits for the baby boom generation in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans would take the 11-year, $1.611 trillion budget
surplus projected by the Congessional Budget Office and use $761
billion for Social Security and $702 billion for a range of tax
cuts, including elimination of the so-called marriage penalty and
inheritance taxes, repeal of the 1993 tax on Social Security
benefits for affluent recipients and reduction of the capital gains
tax to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus projections assume the economy will continue to
grow.

year's exhibition opener against Philadelphia. And then, just as
quickly, Dedric Ward returned to the obscurity of being an unknown
third-round draft pick out of the University of Northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the opening of another Jets exhibition season Thursday
night, again against the Eagles, and Ward is back in the mix,
talking of becoming a starting wide receiver. And if Bill Parcells
wants him to return punts, too, well, that's OK
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's starting I'm thinking of,'' said Ward, who has grown
into a confident, if still small, second-year player.
</P>
<P>
   His debut a year ago was spectacular: Against the Eagles he
showed why he was one of the the nation's top small-college kickoff
returners. He generated 79 yards on three kickoff returns, brought
back a punt 22 yards and, for good measure, scored the game's
pivotal touchdown on a 33-yard pass from Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells chewed him out in that same game. For Ward
misjudged a punt, calling for a fair catch and then having to chase
the ball when it landed over his head, a mistake that put the Jets
in jeopardy. Parcells soon learned, too, that Ward, accustomed to
returning kickoffs along the sidelines, couldn't get away with that
in the pros, where the wings are covered.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Ward saw limited action in the first three games of
the regular season, sat out two more, and then was used sparingly
the rest of the season. Ward became a 5-foot 9-inch, 180-pounder
without a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angered with him last year because he was not performing
under pressure,'' Parcells said. ``He'd make a play and give up a
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite being in a doghouse of sorts, Ward wasn't totally
ignored. As the season progressed, he returned a few punts, and
even came in on some third-down passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the off season, Charlie Weis, the team's offensive
coordinator and receivers coach, watched what Ward was doing and
was impressed. He not only was in the weight room, but also had
gone back to school. He was a course shy of a degree. And because
he was still an undergraduate, he was eligible to compete in track
for his school, which he did, entering the Missouri Valley
Conference championships and finishing second in the 55 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to the Jets, where possibilities have been
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jeff Graham was traded I knew that would open up some
things for me,'' Ward said. ``I'm also fighting to get in as a
starter at some point in my career. Why not me as the third
receiver?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he was playing uninhibited,'' Weis recalled. ``There
was no pressure on him to make the team as a receiver. Now he's
gotten considerably stronger. He's the fastest receiver on the team
and he used the off season to build his body and his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is the club's most dangerous receiver in terms of
speed. And even though his college credentials as a receiver hardly
were on the same level as Alex Van Dyke, now in his third season
with the Jets and also looking to advance, the preseason games this
month will determine whether it is Ward or Van Dyke who becomes the
Jets' third receiver, behind Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet.
Van Dyke, remember, was the NCAA's Division 1A record-holder for
receiving yards in a season when he produced 1,854 for Nevada. The
Jets made him their second draft pick behind Johnson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean anything to Parcells, who may have a
liking for Ward now that he has survived his introduction to the
coach and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bill Parcells, he'll either make you or break you. But
Dedric kept fighting back,'' said Weis.
</P>
<P>
   So now Ward is hoping to move up. He is the second
punt-returner, behind Leon Johnson. He could be the third receiver.
He is waiting to make an impact.

 &HT;    HOUSE PUTS OFF VOTE ON MORE VISAS FOR TECH WORKERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House cancelled a planned
vote Thursday on a bill to create more visas for specially skilled
foreign workers, leaving high-tech companies, universities and
their foreign employees in limbo for another five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sought primarily by high-tech companies that complain
of a shortage of qualified U.S. engineers and computer specialists,
needed substantial Democratic support to pass. In the end, only
four Democrats were willing to buck President Clinton's opposition
to the bill and vote for it, according to House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would fill a gap left by an unprecedented demand for
H-1B visas, a form of work permit that allows specially skilled
foreign workers to take jobs in the United States for up to six
years. This year's allotment of 65,000 visas ran out in early May,
and another 65,000 won't be available until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration agree that more visas
should be made available as soon as possible and that the annual
allotment of visas should be increased in coming years. Beyond
that, the agreement disintegrates over what job protection and
training should be offered to U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   A solution to the impasse won't come until mid-September. The
House planned to adjourn Thursday for its August recess and won't
return until Sept. 9. The Senate is also in recess through August.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, universities are making plans to do without the
foreign professors and researchers they had planned to hire for the
fall, and some companies are letting go the engineers and other
workers whose one-year student work visas have expired.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies have been lobbing letters and phone calls
at members of Congress to encourage creation of more visas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top advisers have recommended that the president veto
any bill that did not require employers to certify that they made
substantial efforts to hire U.S. workers and that no U.S. workers
were laid off. High-tech companies, typically allies of the Clinton
administration, vehemently oppose additional requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration continues to pressure Democrats or
ultimately vetoes the H-1B bill, you can be sure the high-tech
community will take it very seriously,'' said a thinly veiled
political threat issued Thursday by a coalition called American
Business for Legal Immigration. ``This is a balanced pro-jobs,
pro-growth bill and the administration has every reason to support
this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration is standing firm: ``We're negotiating in good
faith and have been for the last several days and would like to
work something out to raise the cap (of 65,000) and protect
American workers,'' said a spokesman for the president's National
Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly in June to increase the number
of visas and impose few new requirements on companies. In the
House, a bill written by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, would have
imposed tough new requirements on employers and was so widely
opposed by the industry that House Republican leaders forced Smith
to accept a scaled-back version that was hashed out with Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But the scaled-back version didn't fly with House Democrats,
even those whose districts include concentrations of high-tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are the ones under pressure on this thing,
especially the ones that represent the high-tech industry, and that
includes the White House,'' said Joe McMonigle, spokesman for Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who supports the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who narrowly escaped having to argue on the House floor
against his original bill, was less combative Thursday: ``At the
end of the day, I expect to see legislation that will meet the
needs of the computer industry and will provide meaningful
safeguards for American workers.''

SIGHT-SEEING BOAT GASHES WHALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Recasting hedline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A high-speed whale-watching boat struck and seriously
injured an endangered humpback whale last Sunday 20 miles east of
Boston, prompting a federal investigation and a search for the
missing animal, which has not been seen for days.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger on the boat, Peggy Kornegger of Somerville, called
the collision ``a chilling experience few of us on that boat will
forget. The woman next to me was sobbing uncontrollably after the
boat hit the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists consider the increasing popularity of
whale-watching a threat to the whales and pushed unsuccessfully a
few years ago for federal rules that limit how close the boats may
get. But Thursday whale-watch officials said Sunday's collision was
both rare and unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, it was almost like something jumping between
two parked cars. It just came up very quickly,'' said Rick Nolan of
Boston Harbor Cruises, which operates the double-hulled catamaran
Millennium that struck the whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had contact'' with a whale in 18
years of whale-watching, said Nolan, the company's managing
partner, ``We feel awful about it. We just hope the whale is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But passenger Kornegger wrote in a letter to the Globe that the
Millennium was going too fast because ``the captain was obviously
starting his rush back to Boston to keep the trip within the
allotted three hours.'' She said such ``quickie'' whale excursions
put the animals at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Humpbacks, which range in size from 30 to 60 feet, are among the
most popular whales because of their spectacular breaches where
they leap out of the water, exposing most of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service, which
enforces laws protecting marine mammals, praised Boston Harbor
Cruises for reporting the collision promptly, but, even if the
collision was an accident, it may have violated the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an endangered species, if you cause injury, there's the
possibility you could be cited,'' said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium, which doubles as a commuter boat on weekdays,
was accelerating for the trip back from the whale-watching ground
at Stellwagen Bank when the captain saw a whale spouting between
the two hulls of the catamaran, Nolan said. The captain tried to go
into reverse, but the boat was going 18.3 miles an hour, less than
half the maximum speed, and struck the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Cetacean Research Unit, a private group based
in Gloucester that provides naturalists for whale-watching tours,
saw the whale a couple hours after the 12:30 p.m. accident, noting
a deep gash near its dorsal fin that Nolan described as ``a pretty
significant wound.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the whale has not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Shorr, spokeswoman for the Center for Coastal Studies in
Provincetown, said her research group is concerned generally about
the new fast catamarans that ply the waters off New England. But
she said whale-watch boats are generally safer for whales than
other boats because their captians observe strict speed limits and
other procedures when whales are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Collisions with boats are a major hazard for whales, Shorr said,
but ``in general, whale-watch boats are not the big offender.''

<P>
   TODI, Italy _ Amid rolling hills, olive groves and sunflower
fields, only the glint of aquamarine swimming pools hints that this
ancient countryside, long ruled by princes and Popes, has new
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   All around the medieval city of Todi, wealthy Americans have
lovingly restored 14th-century fortresses, abbeys and farmhouses,
and added luxury bathrooms, swimming pools and tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a search for beauty, isolation and upper-class
comfort. The province of Umbria, where Todi is located, is not just
rivaling neighboring Tuscany as Italy's most alluring and expensive
summer retreat. For America's Happy Few, Todi is becoming as
fashionable as Martha's Vineyard or the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what some longtime expatriates fear. ``I don't
want this place to be the East Hampton of Europe,'' said Barbara
Rose, an art historian who began restoring her rustic stone
farmhouse in the Todi countryside in 1972. She described herself as
almost living under house arrest in the high season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never go into Todi in the summer,'' she said. ``I loathe
tourism and all the nouveau riche who think they can use their
money to dip in and out of Renaissance World.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps only fitting that a region whose Middle Ages were
dominated by feuds between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines should
now be marked by rifts within its new ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural clash in Todi is not between Umbrian farmers and
American property owners. As in so many exclusive watering holes,
it is mainly between the old guard who got there first and a new
and flashier guard that is threatening to follow _ an Edith Wharton
comedy of manners set, somewhat absurdly, in Umbrian farm country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like the Americans, they really care about preserving
the houses and protecting the land,'' said Claudio Santi, a local
farmer's son who is now one of Todi's more prosperous real-estate
agents. ``But we've noticed that the Americans seem to like us more
than they like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of notable Americans who make up Todi's close-knit old
guard is long: sculptor Beverly Pepper, and her husband Bill
Pepper, a journalist and writer, were Todi's first American
settlers in 1970; abstract painter Al Held, playwright Jay Presson
Allen, documentary film-maker Helen Whitney, museum curators Janie
C. Lee and her husband, David Warren, these are just a few of
Todi's more prominent summer residents. As Ms. Rose put it: ``Its a
selective group. We really are Happy Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Happy Valleys are alike.
</P>
<P>
   Roman film stars, bankers and business tycoons who had tapped
out Tuscany in the booming 1980s began building weekend villas in
Umbria. Then the corruption scandals known as Tangentopoli
(``Bribesville'') that brought down former Prime Minister Bettino
Craxi, who is currently a fugitive in Tunisia, burst the Umbria
real-estate bubble.
</P>
<P>
   But rich Americans quickly filled the gap. In 1990, Steven J.
Ross, the late chairman of Time Warner, jolted the social landscape
by buying Olmeta, a 300-acre property that includes 12th-century
ruins, an entire abandoned village and two churches. Ross, who
planned to create a latter-day San Simeon, died in 1992 before the
$20 million renovation could begin.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, bankers and business tycoons have searched the
countryside for their piece of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The Peppers, for example, recently sold Torre Olivolo, their
14th-century stone fortress with terraced vineyards, swimming pool
and olive groves, to two businessmen, Peter Mullin, a management
consultant, and Miles Rubin, a clothing manufacturer and Clinton
donor whose wife, Nancy, is now the U.S. representative to the
United Nations Human Rights Commission. (The Peppers are adding a
simpler house onto Mrs. Pepper's art studio on a lower hill of
their property.)
</P>
<P>
   To some, the change in ownership represents the end of an era.
``These new people are the really rich, and that seems like a big
change,'' said Edward Youkilis, a New York artist and restaurateur
who bought his farmhouse in 1985, as he put it, ``before the Todi
thing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair is currently vacationing on an
Italian prince's estate near San Gimignano in Tuscany. (Tuscany is
so heavily populated by the British that it is known locally as
Chiantishire). Americans in Todi make nervous jokes that Bill
Clinton will soon be summering in Umbria.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, however, is not worried about new neighbors upsetting
the delicate status quo. ``Todi is not going to change or be
overrun,'' he said confidently. ``Mullin and the Rubins are here
because they love and appreciate the place as much as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rentals of luxury houses cost as much as in Tuscany _ $4,000 a
week is considered a bargain. A large property can sell for as much
as $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still possible to find a place,'' said Joseph Helman, an
art dealer based in New York and Rome who is renting the Allens'
restored 16th-century convent as he looks for a suitable Umbrian
ruin of his own. ``It's like New York: you can buy all the
apartments you want in New York if you have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Helman has an inside line: his son-in-law is Domenico Minchilli,
an architect who has restored many farmhouses for American clients.
Helman says Todi outclasses any other resort. ``I've had houses in
Greece, Spain, France, Ansedonia and Porto Ercole,'' Helman said.
``But Umbria is my favorite place. Southampton is closer to a
beach, but it's a long walk to a Raphael.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Americans in Todi say they worry about overdevelopment, but such
fears seem groundless. A new stringent zoning law makes it
virtually impossible to build new houses and local authorities
zealously check to make sure that old farmhouses are renovated in
the time-honored Umbrian style.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, some of the old-timers seem worried that a new
generation of jetsetters will bring catered lunches, cocktail
parties and charity balls in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in the Hamptons, there would be a party every
night,'' said Janie Lee, a Texan and curator of drawings at the
Whitney Museum. ``Here we each give one party and that's it for the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   She bought a place in Todi in 1972 to ``get away from the
socializing.'' Ms. Lee added, ``Americans I know here are almost
without exception people who come here to work, and to work
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who worry that their idyllic countryside will be trampled
by American billionaires could actually be in for an entirely
different kind of social upheaval.
</P>

ACCUSING PALESTINIAN LEADER OF INACTION, TWO MINISTERS RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a new sign of dissatisfaction with Yasser
Arafat's governance, two of his cabinet ministers resigned Thursday
to protest what they said had been the Palestinian leader's failure
to address problems within the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations came a day after Arafat stunned many members of
the Palestinian Legislative Council by unveiling a long-postponed
cabinet shuffle that failed to respond to their calls for him to
root out graft and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   One who resigned was Hanan Ashrawi, one of the most prominent
Palestinians on the international stage. The other was Abdul Jawah
Saleh, who had criticized Arafat before but who went on Thursday to
accuse him of blocking Saleh's efforts to crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fought corruption in my own ministry I referred some of
the high-ranking officials to the attorney general,'' Saleh said.
``The chairman himself interfered to stop any legal proceedings
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ashrawi said her relationship with Arafat was ``based on
mutual respect'' but complained that changes within the authority
meant that ``decision-making has in a sense been reduced to a few
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations were a new blow to Arafat's prestige, which has
suffered since he returned from exile in 1994 to become chairman of
the Palestinian Authority, which rules Gaza and parts of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Along with stalled talks on a broader peace with Israel, his
chief problems have been a worsening economy in Palestinian-ruled
areas and the nearly universal perception that the authority is
corrupt and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   But these problems seemed unlikely to evolve into a threat to
his leadership, Palestinian analysts said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the shuffle that he announced on Wednesday, Arafat added 10
members to the 18-member cabinet, but did not dismiss any of those
most widely seen as corrupt. A year ago the 88-member Legislative
Council had called on him to make changes after an official
investigation alleged a widespread pattern of corruption,
mismanagement and waste within the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ashrawi, who had been one of two women in the cabinet,
gained international visibility as the spokeswoman for the
Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace conference in
Madrid in 1991. She has since appeared frequently on American
television broadcasts, and had served since 1994 as minister of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the shuffle, Arafat had asked Mrs. Ashrawi to move to
the Tourism Ministry. Mrs. Ashrawi said Thursday that she had
decided not to accept that appointment, and she made clear that her
refusal to join the new team had been based on more than a job
preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being part of this new formation, in my opinion, will not
achieve anything,'' she told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. She described herself as part of a ``genuine change and
reform campaign.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee voted along party lines Thursday
to charge Attorney General Janet Reno with contempt of Congress,
transforming into a criminal case the political battle over whether
an independent counsel should be appointed to investigate and
prosecute campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Reno's refusal to give the committee reports on the
issue from the top Justice Department investigators: FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, former chief of the department's
task force on campaign finance. They testified Tuesday that their
memorandums argued that the law required Reno to ask a special
court to name an independent counsel in the investigation of
Democratic fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans on the committee, the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight, have demanded that Reno seek an
independent counsel, but she has adamantly and repeatedly declined
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view in the Capitol on Thursday was that an
accommodation would be reached and that the contempt issue would be
resolved before it reached prosecution. Congress often threatens
contempt proceedings, but no top government official has ever been
prosecuted on such a charge. Compromises have always been found
first.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday _ with 24 Republicans in favor of contempt and
18 Democrats and Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an Independent,
opposed _ came at the end of a four-hour meeting infected with
partisan acrimony and personal animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe that the attorney general is not following the
law, then we have a responsibility to find out why,'' declared Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's top Democrat, Henry Waxman of California,
accused Burton of a ``blatant strong-arm tactic'' and said that his
request for the investigators' memorandums was ``ludicrous on the
merits.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the vote, Reno accused the committee
of tampering politically with a criminal investigation. She gave no
indication that she would ever comply with the subpoena for the
memorandums.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives will not take up the matter until
after a four-week recess that begins Friday. If a majority of the
House votes for contempt, the matter will go to the Justice
Department for prosecution. Under an 1857 law, refusal to cooperate
with a congressional committee is punishable by up to one year in
prison and a fine of up to $1,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House committees have voted twice to cite Cabinet officers for
contempt for refusing to turn over documents. But these cases _
involving Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1975 and Interior
Secretary James Watt in 1982 _ were dropped after compromises were
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The full House voted to charge Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford with contempt in 1983, but this
case was also dropped before prosecution after lawmakers were given
access to the documents they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has made clear that he would withdraw the subpoena for
the Freeh and La Bella memorandums if Reno asked for an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Burton committee appears to be on solid legal ground. Courts
have ruled repeatedly over the years that Executive Branch must
comply with congressional subpoenas unless the committee issuing
the subpoena lacks jurisdiction or the president asserts executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, there is no question of jurisdiction, and no claim
of executive privilege has been brought.
</P>
<P>
   But the wisdom of the subpoena and the contempt citation is
another matter. At her news conference Thursday, Reno said that
important principles were at stake. ``The department cannot do its
duty if it is subjected to a process that can only shake public
confidence in our ability to make law-enforcement decisions free of
political pressure,'' she asserted. ``And it cannot perform the way
it should if required to submit internal memoranda to political
scrutiny in a manner that can only squelch candid, honest, open
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Freeh and La Bella pleaded with the committee not to
demand access to their memorandums. Release of the documents, La
Bella said, would be ``devastating to the investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman played a videotape Thursday of that portion of the Freeh
and La Bella testimony. ``They're telling us that releasing the La
Bella memo would provide a road map to their case,'' Waxman said,
``and the chairman pays no attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burton was unswayed. He said: ``I understand their concerns.
I know why they fell that way. Under normal circumstances, we would
not have subpoenaed them. But these are not normal circumstances.
We have a reasonable basis for believing that the attorney general
isn't upholding the law, and we have an obligation under the
Constitution to find out if that is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton insisted that ``the documents are not for public
consumption'' and that the committee would would be careful to keep
them confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said all along that she had not ruled out seeking an
independent counsel and would so if she received compelling new
evidence. In her recent statements, she has left a vague impression
that the La Bella memorandum, given to her July 16, might give her
the opportunity to reconsider her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she asked for three weeks to review La Bella's
document, 94 pages with a foot-thick stack of exhibits attached.
After that, she told Burton, she would brief him privately on the
contents of the memorandum and testify publicly if he wished.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not satisfied. He said: ``The August recess is coming
up, and we'll be rushing to finish up in September. I'm not
inclined to leave this matter unresolved. At any rate, the attorney
general has given no indication that she is willing to be any more
forthcoming in September than she is today.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the contempt vote Thursday reflected the frustration of
Burton and his fellow Republicans over the obstacles they have
faced in their campaign finance investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been less than fully cooperative.
More than 100 witnesses have fled the country or asserted their
Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. And
just last month, there were indications that Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., had access to the Freeh memorandum that was being withheld
from Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois expressed these frustrations.
``This committee has been shut out,'' he declared. ``Day in and day
out, week in and week out, month in and month out, year in and year
out. It's time to change the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona, a former prosecutor, accused Reno
of ``prosecutorial malpractice'' and ``incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats maintained that the investigation had been
crippled by the partisan spirit in which Burton and his committee
operated. ``The whole thing is about embarrassing the attorney
general,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin. ``It's not about
justice. It's not about the seeking of truth.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vaccines are made of dead or weakened germs. When they are
injected _ or, in some cases, swallowed _ vaccines alert the body's
immune system, which forms antibodies to fight a particular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, antibiotics attack invading germs rather than work
preemptively. Their chemical assaults weaken the invaders to help
the immune system fight the infection. Typically, success requires
daily doses. Antibiotics can work against a variety of microbes,
making them more flexible than vaccines. But they cannot kill
viruses, a crucial shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   As a counter to germ attacks, both vaccines and antibiotics can
be administered in advance. But that step, while potentially
effective, is also laden with logistic, legal, cost and medical
problems, especially with vaccines, which in their current state of
development carry some risk of causing accidental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, depots of stored vaccines and antibiotics are also
useful for biological defense because the medications can be
administered quickly to help stop epidemics already in progress,
just as quick immunizations can help control natural outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   With vaccines, the Clinton administration is basically pursuing
all options. It is vaccinating troops against anthrax, is preparing
to stockpile other vaccines for the military, and is embarking on a
parallel stockpiling effort for civilians. For now, that step is
caught up in debate and delays.

HOUSE APPROVES PLAN TO REFORM CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House gave final approval Thursday to a plan to
overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws and sent the measure to
the Senate where a similar proposal died earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   House supporters expressed confidence that the American people
would ``rise up and demand action from the Senate.'' Until now,
Republican Sens. Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, and Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, chief Senate opponent of rewriting campaign
money laws, have blocked attempts to force a final vote on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure, sponsored by Reps. Chris Shays,
R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., on a final vote of 252-179. The
action came after a vote of 222-147 to defeat a substitute measure
offered by a bipartisan coalition of freshmen lawmakers. Sixty-one
members also voted present on the freshmen's measure, rather than
vote for or against it.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills aimed to control the huge sums of unregulated and
unlimited contributions known as ``soft money'' to the political
parties. But the Shays-Meehan measure succeeded because it calls
for a complete ban on soft money donations from corporations,
special interests and individuals to both the national and state
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen's bill would have allowed the state Republican and
Democratic parties to continue to raise the controversial
donations, which do not have to be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have a ban on soft money, you have to ban it at
both the federal and state levels,'' Shays said, referring to the
freshmen bill's failure to prohibit it at the state level as a
``huge loophole'' that would only lead to more abuses of the
campaign system.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the freshmen's bill, however, said that banning
soft money contributions to the state parties was ``too
far-reaching'' and amounted to a federal assertion of power over
states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any business telling the state parties what to
do,'' said Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill also went further than the freshmen's
measure in trying to control the use of so-called television and
radio ``issue ads'' by unidentified special interests to trash
specific candidates in the closing days of an election campaign.
The bill would restrict the airing of such ads until the final 60
days before an election and would force the sponsors of the
commercials to identify themselves and their financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shays-Meehan restores accountability to the political process
by requiring these groups to disclose who they are and where their
money is coming from,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen's measure would have forced the sponsors of issue
ads to disclose their identities and funding as well, but it would
not have imposed any other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said the sponsors of the freshmen measure felt that
imposing restrictions on advertising would have been
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we have the stronger reform bill because we
know it will pass constitutional scrutiny,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan and freshmen bills emerged as the two strongest
of a dozen campaign finance reform measures that the House began
debating in May. Most of the bills were withdrawn from
consideration because they had little support. Some would have
tightened or changed current laws governing campaign donations and
expenditures. Others would have removed current limits on
contributions or placed other restrictions on the way campaigns are
paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill was modeled after a similar bipartisan
bill in the Senate authored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ
Feingold, D-Wis. The McCain-Feingold bill died earlier this year
after repeated attempts to force a vote on it were blocked by Lott
and McConnell.

SEEKING BACK TAXES, RUSSIA RAIDS 3 BIG OIL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Tax collectors swooped down on three of Russia's
biggest oil companies Thursday, seizing executives' cars,
apartments and other assets to hammer home its demand for payment
of more than $150 million in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures copied a highly successful raid six weeks ago on
the offices of the natural-gas monopoly Gazprom, Russia's largest
corporation and at the time its single biggest tax delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   And they came amid new indications that President Boris
Yeltsin's current army of economic advisers _ unlike his previous
ones _ are serious about carrying out the latest last-ditch program
to stave off fiscal collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Russian State Tax Service moved on the
offices of Eastern Oil, Onako and Sidanko, the three petroleum
companies, less than a day after Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
met with oil executives to demand back payments and discuss changes
in tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Service's chief of corporate collections, Vladimir
Popov, said at a news conference that the raids should not be
regarded as evidence of a war against businesses but as ``the
beginning of a well-thought-out program of working with major
taxpayers like oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment analysts agreed that the actions were well thought
out. ``It's an inexorable process,'' said Tom Adshead, co-director
of research for United Financial Group in Moscow. ``They're going
down the list of big tax debtors one by one. There are a lot of
people out there who owe them money.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, the government placed a limit on oil exports by
Sidanko and Onako, saying the cap would not be lifted until the two
companies make good on previous agreements to pay their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Popov said the next target for tax collectors would be Rosneft,
a huge petroleum producer owned in large part by the government
itself. The government has sought for months to privatize Rosneft
but has been unable to strike a deal because of falling oil prices
and the company's financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's advisers also took a newly toughened stance on another
front Thursday, confronting coal miners who have been taking
hostages, carrying on hunger strikes and blocking major highways
and rail lines to demand months of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy prime minister for energy, Boris Nemtsov, said the
government would begin to withhold payments to coal-mining
industries in any areas where strikers are blocking rail lines. He
also said the government would ignore demands from any miners who
are breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the head of the Federation of Independent Trade
Unions threatened to call a nationwide strike on Oct. 7 _ the date,
not coincidentally, when Bolsheviks began the 1917 revolution,
which began seven decades of Communist rule in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government wants total war, it's going to get it,''
said Andrei Isayev, the union's political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Coal miners across the nation have sporadically blocked highways
and rail lines since last spring as government promises to make
good on past wages came to naught. Sometimes that was because
state-owned companies had refused to pay for shipments of coal;
sometimes it was because state payments to miners were siphoned off
by corrupt mine managers and others.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the unrest has spread. One major electric
utility, which serves the 720,000 residents of Sakhalin Island, in
the Pacific, is preparing to shut down for lack of fuel. The miners
partially lifted their blockade Thursday, allowing limited coal
shipments into the plant, but said they would impose it again if
back wages were not paid by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov said Thursday that the government was already spending
more money to aid coal miners than for any other sector of the
economy, and that the added cost of the strikes cannot be borne any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said only last week that he expected this autumn would
be politically difficult, and the government's new toughness
reflects preparations for that.
</P>
<P>
   The government is in a political and fiscal bind. International
lenders have made it clear that they will pull their money out and
refuse to make new loans _effectively bankrupting the government _
unless Russia reforms its tax system and improves collections.
</P>
<P>
   But those very changes seem destined to enrage citizens who
already have lost wages or pensions to corruption, inflation or
economic collapse, and who find the notion of new taxes repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has increased tax collections for three straight months,
to about $1.9 billion in July, and it plans to pass the $2 billion
mark in August. But those amounts are still only about 80 percent
of goals set by the International Monetary Fund, which controls a
$22.5 billion loan package intended to keep the government solvent
while it strengthens the economy and reforms its fiscal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Like many outside experts, Adshead, of the United Financial
Group, says the government has only until autumn to demonstrate
that it is on the road to recovery.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his legal team will be using
all their contacts and resources to learn what Monica S. Lewinsky
told a federal grand jury Thursday, and they will use that
knowledge to shape the president's upcoming testimony before the
same panel, legal analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what they learn in this perfectly legal pursuit,
the president may still try to avoid making any statement to the
grand jury, some analysts speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed late last month to testify on Aug. 17 by video
hook-up from the White House, and he told reporters he was
``anxious'' to answer questions ``completely and truthfully.'' But
on Wednesday, the White House invoked a claim of executive
privilege to block prosecutors from taking testimony from White
House lawyer Lanny Breuer _ a move some analysts said could
foreshadow an attempt by Clinton to apply the same claim of
privilege to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is laying the groundwork for the president to exert
executive privilege,'' speculated Douglas Kmiec, a Reagan
administration adviser on constitutional law who now teaches at the
University of Notre Dame. ``I think the president is going to show
up on Aug. 17 and questions will be given to him, but at a critical
point he will say, `Mr. Starr, I'd like to cooperate, but the
interests of government preclude me from doing so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
invoking a privilege against testifying is one of several course of
actions still open to Clinton. Trying to use the privilege to
shield Breuer from testifying ``suggests that the president is not
averse to raising claims to bar information from the grand jury,
and he may then do it himself to keep himself out of it,''
Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Schertler, a former federal prosecutor, took a
narrow view of what information Clinton could withhold under a
claim of executive privilege, saying that privilege usually applies
to matters of government. ``It would not apply to questions about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,'' Schertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive privilege is a controversial power, not mentioned in
the Constitution, that has been occasionally invoked by presidents
to withhold documents or testimony on secret or sensitive matters
from Congress and courts. Raising it might allow Clinton to avoid
testifying without invoking a Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination, a move that some Republican lawmakers have
asserted could be grounds for impeachment in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the Fifth'' might also paint Clinton, in the public
eye, as a kind of criminal figure. ``The Fifth Amendment reminds
people of Jimmy Hoffa testifying to a committee. It tarnishes the
presidency,'' Kmiec said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is some evidence courts might accept a claim of
executive privilege. The US Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia has rejected claims that the attorney-client privilege
shields White House lawyers from testifying in the Lewinsky matter,
Rothstein said, but on two occasions the court suggested it might
be open to a claim of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had apparently agreed to testify before it became known
that prosecutors had obtained a dress from Lewinsky that might
contain physical evidence of a sexual liaison between the president
and the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the dress may have Clinton rethinking his
agreement to testify, several analysts speculated. Faced with ``he
said-she said'' testimony about a romantic link between Clinton and
Lewinsky, and possible attempts to cover it up, prosecutors could
use evidence from the dress, if it exists, to challenge the
president's version of the events.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team will base some decisions about the
president's testimony on information they obtain about Lewinsky's
statements to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a White House lawyer, I'd be calling up (Lewinsky
counsel) Plato Cacheris and taking him out to dinner, breakfast and
lunch,'' said Schertler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet the White House will make an effort to get sources
in the courthouse to find out what she said, and to craft that
testimony in response,'' said Kmiec, who is on leave from Notre
Dame to teach at Pepperdine University in California, the same
school that extended a job to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
Among other things, the White House will want to know if
prosecutors obtained testimony from Lewinsky or other witnesses
that can be used to lay traps for Clinton during his own testimony,
perhaps to induce statements from the president that prosecutors
can later claim amount to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   It would be legal, analysts said, for Clinton and Lewinsky to
have arranged a joint defense agreement in which each gives the
other details of any statements to prosecutors or the grand jury.
Starr, in fact, has no powers to block Lewinsky from telling
Clinton's lawyers what she said to the grand jury, Schertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as part of an immunity agreement, Starr could not have
forced Lewinsky to withhold details of her testimony from Clinton's
team, Schertler said. ``It's the opposite side of the principle
that prevents someone from influencing witnesses or obstructing
justice,'' he said. Silencing a witness ``interferes with the
defense's right to investigate a case.''

<P>
   On May 22, President Clinton unveiled an ambitious plan to
stockpile vaccines at strategic sites around the country so
communities could better fight germ attacks. ``We must do more to
protect our civilian population,'' Clinton told graduating
midshipmen at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. ``We must do more
to protect our people.''
</P>
<P>
   While such major initiatives usually result from many months and
sometimes years of fierce debate, this one, federal and private
experts said in interviews, was developed in record time, rushed
through amid worries of rising threats from Iraq and germ
terrorists. But today the multi-million-dollar plan is in jeopardy,
a victim in part of the haste in which the decision was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials are now calling for a different
approach that initially plays down vaccines in favor of
antibiotics. Others defend vaccines, but concede that getting them
quickly is nearly impossible, given industry's production limits
and the need to insure vaccine safety and effectiveness. Still
others fault vaccines as offering little or no protection against
such deadly threats as smallpox and anthrax, seen as likely weapons
in germ attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A review of events leading to the Clinton vaccine decision
reveals that the proposal was pushed by a small group of
scientists, businessmen and policy makers who largely shared the
same views as they struggled to do something, anything, about a
threat whose dimensions were potentially terrifying but
frustratingly unclear. Working in Washington's frenetic, often
insular world, they tended to overwhelm or sidestep doubters, and
failed to see warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ A presidential meeting where seven scientists endorsed the
stockpile plan included two men who stood to gain financially from
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan was made without consulting leaders of the drug
industry about whether companies could fulfill the president's
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   _ The apparent consensus on acquiring vaccines masked deep
divisions among scientists and military officials.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Patrick III, who made germ weapons for the United
States before President Richard Nixon outlawed them in 1969, warned
that vaccinations against particular germs could be easily
countered by foes, making such safeguards potentially useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a problem,'' Patrick said. ``Defensive measures
are much more difficult than offensive ones. There's no easy way
around it. You immunize against anthrax and then an enemy just
tries something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Clinton administration's top public health officials
have begun to warn that stockpiling vaccines is no quick fix. ``My
view is that the stockpile isn't sufficient,'' said a senior
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We
need an entire care system in place'' to avoid creating a false
sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress, which has strongly supported the Clinton
administration's anti-terrorism efforts, is questioning the
rationale and structure of the civilian stockpile. A Senate hearing
is being considered for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan,'' said Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who follows the
issue, ``needs to be more carefully thought out and discussed more
publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PENTAGON: In Early Debate, Focus on Troops
</P>
<P>
   For decades, scientists and military officials debated the
merits of vaccines as a defense against germ warfare. Worries grew
after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when United Nations inspectors
found that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had studied dozens of
microbial agents and had placed at least 180 biological bombs and
warheads around the country ready to spray lethal germs on allied
troops.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon discussed an ambitious program to make a variety
of vaccines, its officials weighed the possibility that enemies
would simply choose new deadly germs or modify old ones to outwit
U.S. defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked if we were just making it possible for Saddam to
pick another agent,'' recalled Dr. Stephen Joseph, a physician who
at the time was assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph added that he and his Pentagon colleagues nonetheless
recommended in the mid-1990s that the military embark on a vaccine
effort. They were motivated in part, Pentagon officials said, by
intelligence reports of rising dangers outside Iraq of germs being
used against U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Pentagon began looking for a company to develop and
obtain licenses for 18 vaccines other than the standard one for
anthrax. The initial ones were to guard against smallpox, which
causes fever, boils and can be fatal; tularemia, which causes
chills, aches, fatigue and typhoid-like symptoms, and Q-fever,
which causes headaches, weakness and coughing.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the Pentagon awarded a $322 million, 10-year
contract for the 18 vaccines to DynPort, a British-U.S. venture.
The plan sidestepped the knotty issue of immunizing troops,
focusing instead on making and stockpiling vaccines for military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, stored vaccines are useful for biological defense
because they can be sent to help stop epidemics, just as quick
immunizations can help control natural outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the Pentagon would use its stored vaccines would
depend on future events and threats.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, worry in the Pentagon about biological attacks
turned to alarm as U.S. troops prepared to strike Iraq after Saddam
expelled Americans from international teams investigating his germ
arsenal. On Dec. 15, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced that
all 2.4 million U.S. troops would get anthrax shots. Pentagon
officials said the effort would take six years and cost $130
million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just at that moment, the theory of enemy countermeasures became
real publicly for the first time. In December, Russian scientists
stunned the biological world by disclosing that they had used
genetic engineering to make a new anthrax microbe. It attacked
blood cells and made Russia's vaccine useless.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the organism was a laboratory curiosity or a battlefield
weapon was unclear. The Russian scientists gave out no samples, so
detailed analysis was impossible. But Western military officials
were shaken and wondered whether the U.S. anthrax vaccine was now
obsolete, and whether the same was true of other vaccines in
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an academic debate anymore,'' said Jack Melling,
director of the Salk Institute in Swiftwater, Pa., a vaccine center
that does research for the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   The news got worse in February. Ken Alibek, a top Russian
defector, went public to assert that Moscow was working on a range
of exotic germ weapons, including hybrids of the smallpox virus
that cause profuse bleeding. If real, such germs could sow plagues
that kill most victims.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Pushing a Plan To Save Civilians
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Clinton became fixated on the emerging germ
threat and ways to counter it among civilians, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Influences are said to have included the Iraqi crisis, the
Russian claims, the intelligence reports and a novel, ``The Cobra
Event'' (Random House, 1997), about a terrorist attack on New York
City with a genetically engineered mix of the smallpox and cold
viruses. Clinton was so alarmed by the book, his aides said, that
he instructed his intelligence experts to assess its credibility
and urged House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia to read it.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that the president and his National Security Council
increasingly wrestled with the danger of biological attacks not
only on troops abroad but also on U.S. cities, states or even the
entire country.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in his State of the Union address, Clinton vowed to
confront the hazard of germ weapons obtained ``by outlaw states,
terrorists and organized criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the White House held a secret exercise to play out
what would happen if terrorists struck with one of the theoretical
smallpox hybrids. The results of the war game were grim and fueled
a federal drive to find better ways to cope with such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the president explored ways in which modern biology
might help. He and his top officials met at the White House on
April 10 with seven private scientists in the Truman Room, where
Cabinet meetings are held. For an hour, participants say, the
scientists discussed the germ topic and pushed for a vaccine
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attending officials included the secretary of defense,
the attorney general, the secretary of health and human services,
the director of Central Intelligence and the president's national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists present were Dr. Frank Young, a former head of
the Food and Drug Administration, who moderated the panel; Dr.
Joshua Lederberg, president emeritus of Rockefeller University; Dr.
Lucille Shapiro, a biologist at Stanford University; Jerome Hauer,
head of emergency management for New York City; and Dr. Barbara
Rosenberg, a biological arms-control expert at the Federation of
American Scientists, a private group.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific panel also had two industry experts, both with
financial ties to vaccine work.
</P>
<P>
   One was a pioneer of genetic engineering who had decoded the
smallpox virus and other microbes and used the meeting to push his
own scientific agenda, participants said. But the researcher, Dr.
J. Craig Venter, president of The Institute for Genomic Research, a
non-profit biotechnology group just outside Washington, said he
simply urged the government to step up support for the genetic
mapping of deadly microbes. The insights, he added, would aid
vaccine development and new methods of germ detection and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument is that if we decipher these genomes it could be
the ultimate deterrent,'' Venter said, referring to the ability to
have so many avenues of defense that germ attacks would become
futile.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his institute had received millions of dollars
in Federal support and is now gearing up to use more government
money to map the anthrax microbe as an aid to germ defense.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House meeting, participants said, the business
interests of another scientist were less well known.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Monath was identified in a White House announcement
as a vice president of OraVax and a former official of the Centers
for Disease Control and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases, the government's top body for defensive
germ-warfare studies.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, a
world authority on yellow fever and other epidemics, Monath had
devoted most of his career to public service.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, he was viewed mainly through that lens,
participants said, who added that they knew little about his
company other than it worked on vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Cambridge, Mass., OraVax was founded in 1990 to tap an
emerging multi-billion-dollar market in oral vaccines and
antibodies to combat infectious diseases. But the small company
kept having problems getting beyond research and bringing products
to market.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 and 1997, its survival at stake, OraVax tried to win
part of the Pentagon's expanding germ work as a subcontractor to
make smallpox and other vaccines. By early this year, that work had
failed to materialize and the company's stock price was down 90
percent from $10 a share in the initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of meeting participants varied, but no one could recall
Monath telling the president of his company's financial interest in
vaccine stockpiles _ a step he now insists that he took.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to handle it is to be open, so people understand that
I may have a potential bias,'' Monath said. ``I don't make it a
business of taking advantage of situations in which I'm asked to
participate to push the OraVax agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many participants remember Monath arguing forcefully for
stockpiling, a subject he had been asked by the panel's moderator
to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said the views of Monath, while strong, reflected the
panel's consensus. ``Even through he was pushing harder than anyone
else, our recommendations to develop stockpiles of vaccines and
medicines would have come out the same,'' Venter said.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Army colonel, Monath was most likely the only
scientist in the room who had deeply studied such problems for germ
defense as enemy countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   That topic, participants say, was discussed little and in any
case was overshadowed by Venter's repeated assertions that genetic
advances in theory had the power to solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential briefing was such a hit that the experts were
asked to take it on the road. In the following weeks, the
scientists delivered their views to senior officials involved in
vaccine issues at the Pentagon and the Department of Health and
Human Services, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, the panel delivered a follow-up report to the
president that, among other things, called for a stockpile of drugs
and vaccines to protect millions of Americans against a variety of
germs, up to 40 million against smallpox. The total cost over five
years was estimated at $420 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stockpile, the report said, could help ``reduce the death
and illness 10 to 100 fold.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said the recommendation by the scientific panel simply encouraged
the administration to do what it was already contemplating. The
official added that he saw no conflict of interest in Monath's
participation because his company had signed no federal contracts
for vaccine production.
</P>
<P>
   Government ethics experts say that such private White House
advisers are exempt from federal conflict-of-interest rules and
that Monath, even if he had an undisclosed interest, broke no law.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official called Monath ``very knowledgeable,''
adding, ``The point of the meeting was to get a wide range of
opinions from leading experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America, a
Washington trade group that represents the nation's top 100 drug
companies (OraVax is not among them), said it was never contacted
by the White House for advice on the stockpile idea.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPANY: Good News In the Stock Market
</P>
<P>
   OraVax at this time was increasingly desperate. In filings to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it had won
part of the Pentagon vaccine work.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price continued to slide. On May 4, the company put
out a news release boasting of the contract, and the stock rose
that day in heavy trading to $1.31, up from $1.00.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, OraVax had only a preliminary promise of possible
work as a subcontractor to the British-U.S. venture that had won
the Pentagon contract, executives from both companies now agree.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say such misrepresentations in SEC filings
are potential violations of federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same month, as rumors and news reports suggested the
president was about to announce a civilian stockpiling effort,
OraVax president Lance Gordon issued a press release saying the
company was prepared to take on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is no guarantee that OraVax will be involved,''
Gordon said in the May 21 statement, ``the company believes it has
the capacity to produce both smallpox and tularemia vaccines for
civilian use.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a Friday, Clinton announced the new push to create
stockpiles of ``medicines and vaccines to protect our civilian
population.'' He also praised gene research as ``very, very
important'' to developing new ways of countering germ terror.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, 2,413,100 shares of OraVax changed hands on the
Nasdaq exchange, closing at $1.41, up 28 cents, or 25 percent. It
was the stock's heaviest trading day ever. Later, the company
issued a statement explaining the sudden activity, which it
attributed to the president's action.
</P>
<P>
   For Monath, who owns or has options on 150,574 shares, the
stock's price increase amounted to a profit on paper of $42,160.
</P>
<P>
   THE BATTLE: In Shaping Shield, Emphasis Changes
</P>
<P>
   A quiet war erupted as federal agencies and experts weighed in
heavily for the first time. The Department of Health and Human
Services, designated to oversee the stockpile, was ambivalent about
the project, officials said. The agency faulted the initiative as
simplistic, saying the plan put too little emphasis on the costly,
painstaking work of improving the nation's public health network to
cope with germ attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the agency found that no company was making, or
would soon be able to make for civilians, the vaccines scheduled to
be stockpiled. It therefore switched the emphasis to antibiotics.
Though also potentially vulnerable to enemy countermeasures, these
drugs were seen as having the benefit of fighting a variety of
noxious germs.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the woes, the agency also found that existing stocks
of smallpox vaccine had been so poorly stored that two-thirds of
them were useless. Of 15.8 million doses, only 4.9 million were fit
for human immunization, the administration told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the president's announcement, on June 8, the
government quietly began to back pedal. Even though the White House
asked Congress for $51 million in the next fiscal year to develop
``a civilian stockpile of antidotes, antibiotics and vaccines,''
that same day administration officials disclosed that vaccines had
been ruled out for the moment. Why? Cheaper and more effective ones
might appear in the next few years, the officials told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The developing plan has yet to address in detail how and where
the medicines would be made, stored or distributed in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As for Oravax, its stock is down, closing Thursday at 56 cents.
And it still has no federal stockpile work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, many experts continue to back vaccines as
important for germ defense and even hold out the possibility of
wide civilian immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preventing an outbreak is always preferable to trying to
suppress one after it has started,'' said Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that an enemy might outwit vaccines with new or
modified germs, vaccine supporters say that most of these enhanced
germs are theoretical and would probably be less available and
attractive to terrorists than known strains of deadly, dependable
germs like unmodified anthrax and smallpox. If so, they say,
vaccines are a good deterrent and a relatively cheap insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their flaws or merits, vaccines continue to draw the
interest of small companies eager to gain a foothold in an
expanding area of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, the state of Michigan approved the sale of the
nation's only licensed maker of anthrax vaccine to a company led by
Adm. William Crowe, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who was an important supporter of Clinton's in the 1992
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's newly formed company has individuals with extensive drug
industry experience and now has an inside track on at least $60
million in Pentagon contracts, officials of the Defense Department
said. And while aiming at the military market, it wants to expand
to civilian customers as well, company officials said, if that
becomes possible in the years ahead. Companies drawn to the
germ-defense business see the emerging civilian market as
potentialy dozens of times larger than the military one and much
more profitable.

AMERICANS FISH AS RESENTFUL CANADIANS OBSERVE SALMON BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (js) 
 BY THE NEW YORK TIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ In a routine year for the Lax
Kw'alaams Indian tribe led by Don Reynierse, the sight of salmon
boats on the icy north Pacific at the beginning of salmon fishing
season would be cause for good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But this year has been anything but routine for Reynierse's
people and hundreds of other Canadian fishermen in the communities
that dot British Columbia's rugged coastline south of the Alaska
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   The boats Reynierse can see from the dock in Port Simpson, a
fishing village near the Alaskan border, are American, he said in a
telephone interview. They are fishing a few miles up the coast and
come from Alaskan ports. In Port Simpson, the fishing boats have
been idle because of a Canadian fishing ban on the fragile northern
coho salmon stocks. The ban, imposed in June, has left Reynierse
with little more to do than watch.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Simpson and other communities on British Columbia's
northern coast, this fishing season has brought renewed
frustration, as stalled talks between Canada and Alaska on the
Pacific Salmon Treaty have exposed yet another dispute over salmon
fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since the treaty expired in 1994, the United States and Canada
have been able to make only year-to-year agreements. Last year, in
a dispute over how the Americans and Canadians would share the
coastal waters, they were unable to manage even that much, which
led to a standoff between Canadian fishermen and an Alaskan ferry.
</P>
<P>
   This year, negotiations broke off on July 9 after Alaska refused
to observe the Canadian ban on fishing for coho, which pass through
Alaskan waters on their way to Canada's Skeena River. John Fraser,
the chief spokesman for Canada's Department of Fisheries and
Oceans, said that, while Alaskan fishermen continue to fish,
Canadians have been forced to halt or greatly reduce their harvest
of many of the more plentiful species for fear of catching coho
along with them.
</P>
<P>
   John Radosevic, president of the United Fishermen and Allied
Workers Union, said Canadian fishermen felt thwarted not just by
Alaska but also by their own government. A deal in southern British
Columbia with Washington state, which gives Washington 24.9 percent
of the southern sockeye run, has been condemned by Canadian
fishermen as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, Canadians have grudgingly accepted the need for
the coho ban. But resentment lingers against the fisheries
minister, David Anderson, over his inability to reach agreement
with Alaska on the coho stocks. The negotiations on the specific
regions are carried out with the states involved.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan officials contend that Canada's fishing ban, based on
its scientists' studies, is an extreme reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't willing to take that action when we had no evidence
of a so-called coho crisis,'' said Diane Regan of Alaska's Fish and
Game Department. ``As the season goes on, we'll see if it's true or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, Alaska declared the western part of the
state a disaster area in terms of numbers of returning salmon, but
that area is distant from the point of dispute with British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   From the Alaskan side, Canadian fishermen are seen as less
altruistic than they represent themselves to be. Canadians have
been fishing the mouth of the Skeena River recently, Ms. Regan
said, and Alaskan officials contend that what they call a
``voracious'' harvest of sockeye salmon there has inevitably led to
a catch of the protected coho.

STUDENT SUMS UP COURTHOUSE SCENE: `IT'S A CIRCUS' 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under a bright summer sky, and with tourists and a
horde of journalists gathered nearby, a raven-haired young woman
entered the federal courthouse Thursday to deliver salacious
testimony that might darken the future of the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky was whisked into the building to tell a grand
jury that she had a sexual relationship with the married chief
executive. Dressed in a gray blouse, dark blue blazer and dress,
white shoes and pearls, the former White House intern made no
effort to acknowledge the throng of television cameras, reporters
and tourists who anxiously awaited her arrival from a distance of
about 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was just as reclusive inside the courthouse, turning
immediately to the left and taking an elevator usually reserved for
judges. On the third floor, the grand jury awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House,
dozens of cameramen waited for Lewinsky's arrival. Many of them had
spent most business days since the Lewinsky story broke in January
waiting for a dramatic moment, such as the 25-year-old's
appearance. But, just as Lewinsky arrived in a green van at about
8:30 a.m., EDT, a man waved a home-made ``Good Luck, Monica''
banner in front of several cameramen, one of whom made no effort to
disguise his anger at the man who blocked the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here seven months, and will kill you, and so will
several other film crews,'' shouted the cameraman, who declined to
give his name despite his willingness to hurl a scatological
description of the banner carrier. ``I've only been waiting seven
months for that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   George Hancock, who held the banner, said later that he
regretted getting in the cameraman's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to block anyone's shot,'' Hancock said. ``I just
wanted her to see my sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who was visiting the courthouse with his mother,
Phyllis, also insisted he is not anti-Clinton. ``I'm just
anti-trash,'' said the Bowling Green, Ky., resident who stopped off
in Washington with his mother and father on their way to Niagara
Falls, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis, like her 32-year-old son, was holding a yellow banner
with black lettering in support of Lewinsky: ``Monica tells truth.
Slick Willie must.''
</P>
<P>
   And where was Mr. Hancock while his wife and son were at the
courthouse supporting Lewinsky and incurring the wrath of
cameramen? ``Daddy's back at the hotel thinking we're idiots,''
Phyllis said of her husband, David.
</P>
<P>
   Also toting anti-Clinton banners was Lillie Smith, a 72-year-old
homeless woman who uses a wheelchair. ``I don't know about you, but
I deserve better,'' stated one of the banners. ``The cruelest lies
are often told in silence'' and ``The president sets the tone and
climate of the nation,'' stated others.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in conversation, placed much of the blame for the
presidential scandal on the public and said it has been more than
45 years since the United States has had an honorable leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people pay a tremendous price for their
government and demand nothing,'' Smith said. ``There has not been a
decent Democratic administration since (Harry) Truman, a man who
stood by his word.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton also had supporters at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Nancy Kleinberg of Toronto, survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust, said the president's sexual behavior should not be the
subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode is his own private life,'' said Howard Kleinberg,
who was in Washington with his wife to visit the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum. ``I think people should leave the president alone.
It's excitement, but it's excitement at someone's expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kleinberg said other presidents, such as John F. Kennedy,
have had extramarital affairs. Referring to the scandal that
brought Lewinsky before the grand jury, she added, ``I feel sorry
for them all.''
</P>
<P>
   American University student Joshua Silbert, sporting a camera,
said he was visiting the courthouse despite having a paper on
Abraham Lincoln due later that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a circus,'' Silbert said. ``I might as well just capture
it'' on film, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public-relations and government major added that he hopes
the scandal does not hurt the Democratic Party's chances of
recapturing the House of Representatives in the elections this
November.
</P>
<P>
   Silbert, who is entering his senior year, said he sympathizes
with the president's plight. ``He can't sneeze without everybody
knowing,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's burgeoning Hispanic population is
closing in on 30 million and in seven years will overtake blacks as
the country's largest minority group, the Census Bureau reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may happen sooner, because black fertility has dropped,''
said the report's author, John Reed, a social science analyst with
the bureau's Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that there were 29.7 million Hispanic Americans
last year, or 11 percent of the population, and 34.2 million black
Americans, or 12.8 percent. Census Bureau demographers say
immigration and relatively high birth rates will push the number of
Hispanic residents to more than 36 million by 2005, compared with
about 35.5 million African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Already, ``this is the closest that Latinos ever have come to
the black population in absolute numbers,'' said Manuel de la
Puenta, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the gap between the Hispanic and black populations can
be viewed as somewhat narrower than the raw numbers suggest. As an
ethnic rather than racial group, Hispanic Americans are categorized
not only as Latino but also as either black, white, Asian/Pacific
Islander or American Indian. When the 925,000 Hispanic blacks _ a
group generally made up of some Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and
Cubans _ are subtracted from the total black population, the
difference in size between the country's two largest minority
groups shrinks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence of a rapidly changing American
population and of the continuing impact of immigration from Latin
America and high fertility rates among Hispanic women. Census
Bureau figures indicate that the Hispanic population will have
doubled from 1980 to 2005, and the National Center for Health
Statistics reported recently that Hispanic children now outnumber
black children.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of the Hispanic population and the projections for
its growth were based on a yearly survey of 65,000 homes conducted
by the Census Bureau. A hard count must await the 2000 census,
whose accuracy, some demographers say, will depend on whether
Congress allows the bureau to use statistical sampling to augment
traditional counting methods. The bureau estimates that the 1990
census missed about 5 percent of all Hispanic residents.

ANDERSON DRAWING COMPARISONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Garret Anderson is just a pup in comparison to Joe
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   But he's a pup with a bark so loud that sometimes it causes
baseball purists to turn and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, of course, owns the major league record for the
longest hitting streak. The Yankees' Joltin' Joe hit safely in 56
consecutive games in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got halfway to DiMaggio's mark, setting an Angels
record by hitting safely in 28 straight games. Before his streak
was stopped Saturday, Anderson had snapped Hall of Famer Rod
Carew's team-record hitting streak of 25 games set in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and DiMaggio. Anderson and Carew.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon,'' says Anderson smiling, ``Are you looking for a
comparison? Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, who was raised by his mother in Granada Hills, is
too modest to get lured into comparisons with Hall of Famers this
early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Those around him, however, including Carew, say the comparisons
will come.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth season in the majors, Anderson has a career
batting average over .300. He's a left-handed batter, hits line
drives, uses the whole park, and has the mental approach suited for
putting big hitting streaks together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he steps up to the plate he feels he should get a
base hit,'' Carew said. ``I think once you have that type of
attitude, you're going to be successful at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says he can't fathom what DiMaggio went through to
reach 56, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to go there,'' Anderson said. ``I told a
reporter the other day, until you live through that (a 56-game
hitting streak), you can't say, or put it in perspective, what he
had to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started talking to me when I hit 20 straight. I can't
imagine what it would be like to reach 30 straight or 40 straight.
The pressure . . . I have no idea how tough that would be. Think of
what he had to do to accomplish that. He hit solidly for two months
. . . that's two months of hitting . . . that's a long time, a real
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Anderson passed Carew in the Angel record books, a
similar comparison wouldn't be fair, either.
</P>
<P>
   Carew had a lifetime average of .328, and won seven batting
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I still have a long way to go to be a polished hitter
like he was,'' Anderson said of Carew, now the Angels' hitting
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``His 25 straight, that was just one thing he did for a period
of time with the Angels. That doesn't say what his career was like.
My career is nowhere near that right now, so as far as I'm
concerned, there is no comparison at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison, then, is Anderson vs. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined the Angels in 1994 and played his first full
season in 1995, Anderson has gradually set his own milestones and
shown improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Before his call to the majors in July of 1994, Anderson had
three hitting streaks of 11 or more with triple-A Vancouver,
including a 27-game streak that ranked as the longest in the minors
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Anderson became the first rookie to be named American
League Player of the Month, following a July where he hit .410,
with seven homers and 31 RBIs in 25 games. He also had a 14-game
hitting streak, the longest of any rookie that season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Anderson became the first Angel to collect six hits in
a game, doing so in a 15-inning contest against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Anderson's 189 hits were the most by a left-handed
batter in Angels history, passing Carew (179 in 1980) and Luis
Polonia (179 in 1991). He also hit safely in 17 straight, the
longest hitting streak by an Angel that season.
</P>
<P>
   This summer he has reached new heights. In his last 32 games,
Anderson is hitting .391.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all anyone has asked him lately is about the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept asking me questions about the streak, but I pretty
much just pushed them aside. I didn't want to talk about it,''
Anderson said. ``That's just my personality, it's no big deal,
really. After it was over, it was done and over with and you still
have to come out and play the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get caught up in something you did yesterday; that's
how I kept it in perspective. I have a lot of confidence in what
I'm doing and my abilities. If I get a hit, I get a hit; if I
don't, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as his statistics are, it is not something
Anderson consumes himself with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a player, you don't have time to think about stuff
like statistics when you're playing every day,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even superstitious. I don't say I need to do this, or
need to do that, to be successful. I believe in my ability and my
swing. The rest will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew, who hit over .300 for 15 straight seasons, says Anderson
is the type of hitter who will improve over time. He call his swing
``pure'' and says he has the potential to put together streaks
longer than 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes right and he's feeling good and comfortable
at the plate with his timing and rhythm, anything can happen,''
Carew said. ``He uses the whole park. He doesn't just pull the
ball, he hits the ball to left, left-center, right, right-center,
so that in the future will help him if he gets into a streak like
this again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Garret, though, is that he's the kind of kid
not interested in records. He really wants to win. He also has the
attitude to say, `Well this streak is over, I'll just start another
one.' Players with attitudes like that will go a long way, which is
why I think we'll see longer streaks from him in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Anderson see longer streaks in his future?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that question again,'' he said, laughing, ``Please.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   His father is the most revered football player in the history of
the University of Mississippi. And for the past four years his
brother turned the University of Tennessee into Peyton's
</P>
<P>
   Place.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are that Eli Manning
</P>
<P>
   ,
</P>
<P>
   a senior quarterback at Cardinal Isidore Newman High in New
Orleans, won't be spending his college days in Knoxville, Tenn. or
Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eli is his own person,'' said Archie Manning
</P>
<P>
   ,
</P>
<P>
   Eli's father, All-American at Ole Miss and former NFL veteran.
``It will be strictly his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the favorite to land the 6-foot-5, 185-pounder
comes from among Texas, LSU, Florida State or Ole Miss. But Eli has
a wish list of 10 to 15 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for the best fit for me,'' said Eli, who turns 18
in January. ``It doesn't matter if it's north, west, east or
south.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli might wind up wearing orange in college Texas is probably
the leader but it probably won't be in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control comparisons,'' said Archie. ``But it's
tougher for Eli than it was Peyton. The comparisons (for Eli) to
Peyton are so current. It was just five years ago (at Cardinal
Newman) he was quarterbacking on the same field as Eli.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Eli will equal Peyton's accomplishments including
challenging for a Heisman Trophy and becoming a first round NFL
draft pick remains to be seen. But, at this point, Eli, who sports
a B average and 1,070 score on the SAT, compares favorably
physically and statistically to his older brother.

   Peyton, the 1997 Heisman Trophy runnerup and NFL's newest
multi-millionaire, threw for 7,190 yards and 92 touchdowns in his
three years as a starter. In his two seasons, Eli who's an an inch
taller than his brother at the same stage has compiled 4,887 yards
and 50 touchdowns for the Division 2-A (the second smallest of five
division) private school in an upscale section of New Orleans.

   ``You don't expect this type of quarterback to come through your
school,'' said Tony Reginelli
</P>
<P>

and the school's athletic director the past four years. ``And you
sure don't expect it twice. It's unheard of, really. Both kids are
once-in-a-lifetime kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Where they do differ, however, is in personality.

   ``Peyton is an assertive, go-get-em kind of guy,'' Archie said.
``Eli is a lot more laid back. He doesn't seem to react to either
good or bad. His buddies call him Easy. Ol' Easy, that seems to fit
him.''
</P>
<P>
   What won't be easy at least for the people in Oxford, Miss. is
another Manning turning down Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like, `We lost Peyton, we aren't going to lose
Eli,''' said Archie Manning, whose oldest son, Cooper
</P>
<P>
   , was a wide receiver at Ole Miss before a congenital neck
injury ended his career. ``I appreciate their interest and fully
understand the passion they have for Ole Miss football. But, you
have to understand, Peyton wasn't anti-Ole Miss, it just wasn't the
right choice for him at the time. I would love for Eli to go to Ole
Miss, but only if he chooses Ole Miss.''

 &HT;    AIR FORCE GIVING MOST 'SPACE CHIMPS' TO RESEARCH GROUP
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force, angering animal rights advocates,
decided Thursday to give most of 141 chimpanzees with ties to the
space program to a biomedical research group.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing, the Air force said 111 chimps will
remain with the Coulston Foundation, which has leased them since
1970. These chimps, 77 of which have been exposed to HIV or
hepatitis, would be transferred from Holloman Air Force Base near
Alamogordo, N.M. and would permanently belong to Coulston, which is
based there.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the other 30 chimps would go to a Texas group
that operates the nation's largest and oldest primate sanctuary.
Primarily Primates, Inc., of San Antonio will receive the
disease-free chimps from the laboratory by Sept. 30, 1999, when the
laboratory's lease with the Air Force expires.
</P>
<P>
   The chimps, which range in age from 5 to 38, are from an Air
Force colony established in the 1950s. Two chimps that actually
flew into space have died, but many others in the group took part
in space-related tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force move to allow the research group to keep most of
the chimps drew criticism from animal rights advocates. Famed
primatologist Jane Goodall said she was ``astounded'' by the
announcement, saying she believes the Coulston Foundation has a
poor animal care record.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates point to several U.S. Department of Agriculture
citations in the past few years of violations under the federal
Animal Welfare Act. In 1996, Coulston was fined $40,000 by the USDA
after three chimps died because of negligence. Charges were also
brought against the foundation this spring, and last month the USDA
launched another investigation after three chimps died earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incredibly concerned about the welfare of the chimps if
they remain there,'' said Liz Clancy Lyons, spokeswoman for the
Washington-based Doris Day Animal League. ``I think there will be
substantial concern and outrage not only within the animal rights
community but with the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulston spokesman Don McKinney has maintained that the
foundation has been targeted by a ``thuggish and irresponsible
smear campaign'' by animal-rights groups. Some of the Air Force
chimps, a part of a group of more 600 chimps at Coulston, are used
for HIV and hepatitis testing and has been instrumental in creating
a hepatitis vaccine, McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want the public to know is what we do saves lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jack Blackhurst, an associate deputy assistant Air Force
secretary, said there were five applicants seeking custody of the
chimps. Each was evaluated on four criteria, including past
performance of the organization, staffing capability and the
ability of each applicant to finance the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force going into this had no preference,'' said
Blackhurst, who repeatedly stated that the Air Force was neither a
proponent of animal-rights groups or medical research. He said the
decision was solely based on how well each applicant proved they
had the ``capability and werewithal to care for the chimpanzees.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackhurst said that Coulston ``did as well or better than other
chimpanzee facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Swett, president of the non-profit Primarily Primates,
said the chimps going to San Antonio would join 40 others already
at the sanctuary. It would cost about $2.8 million to retire the
new chimps, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that all the chimpanzees deserve a hard-earned
retirement and with sufficient resources, we would have welcomed
the opportunity to give them all a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Noon, project director for the Center for Captive
Chimpanzee Care, a Boynton Beach, Fla.-based organization who
proposed building a sanctuary to retire the chimps, said she was
``delighted'' that a fraction of the chimps would be retired, but
said ``it doesn't allay my fears for the other 111.'' Her proposal,
which would have used 80 acres of donated land outside San Antonio
for a sanctuary, was rejected by the Air Force.

 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michelle Smith, the swimmer who won three gold medals at the
1996 Summer Olympics and became Ireland's most decorated athlete
was banned Thursday from competition for four years after being
found guilty of manipulating a urine sample with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she won her Olympic races in Atlanta and was
congratulated in person by President Clinton, suspicions arose
about the authenticity of Smith's performances, given that her
times had improved dramatically late in her career. Suspicion
continued to grow after Smith failed to appear for at least one
drug test following the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's announcement was shattering in Ireland, where
Smith had become a heroine as the country's first woman to win an
Olympic gold medal. Now she has become of most accomplished
athletes ever to be banned in a drug scandal. Her case is also
noteworthy because it is relatively rare for an athlete to be
caught cheating by tampering with a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Her banishment follows a long list of suspensions for Chinese
female swimmers and is the latest in a series of drug scandals that
have staggered Olympic-related sports this summer. The scandals
have prompted the International Olympic Committee to call for a
worldwide drug summit next January in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that someone who has competed on such a
high level would be in this situation, but you've got to compete
with integrity and it's important to train with integrity,'' said
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, the first woman to be selected as a
vice president of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, DeFrantz will attend a meeting of the IOC's
executive board in Lausanne, at which time plans will begin for a
reappraisal of the Olympic committee's drug-testing policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wish is that we can find ways to make certain that sport at
all levels is both safe and fair for the athletes,'' DeFrantz said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last January 10, Smith was given an unannounced drug test in
Dublin as part of an out-of-competition doping control program
administered by FINA, swimming's world governing body. Random,
out-of-competition testing is considered a more reliable way to
catch cheating athletes, who are more likely to beat announced
tests taken at major competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Her sample, tested in a Barcelona laboratory accredited by the
IOC, was found to have ``unequivocal signs of adulteration,''
according to the lab report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the concentration of alcohol present in the
sample ``is in no way compatible with human consumption'' and that
the sample showed ``a very strong whiskey odor.''
</P>
<P>
   A second test on Smith's urine sample was performed on May 21
and the results were compatible with the January test, according to
FINA. At a hearing on July 24, a federation doping panel found that
the sample had been manipulated in an uncertain manner by Smith and
not by the laboratory, the collectors or the transporters of the
sample.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Smith was banned from national and international
competition for four years, which makes her ineligible for the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. It is highly unlikely that
Smith, now 28, would be able to remain in competitive form for the
2004 Summer Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Drug experts suspect that the use of a substance such as alcohol
to manipulate a drug sample is an attempt to mask the use of
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has continued to maintain that she does not use
performance-enhancing drugs. Neither she nor her attorney commented
on Thursday's banishment, but Smith is scheduled to hold a news
conference Friday in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   She has said previously that she would appeal any ban to the
Swiss-based International Court of Arbitration for Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swimmer stressed that no banned substance had been
detected in her urine,'' FINA said of Smith, referring to her
presence at the July 24 doping panel hearing. ``She asserts that
from her side there was no physical manipulation of the sample.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's suspension is part of an embarrassing summer for sport
that saw the world's top cycling team was thrown out of the Tour de
France for the systematic use of EPO, a substance which increases
oxygen-carrying capacity. And last week, two other Olympic gold
medalists from the United States _ the 1996 shot put champion Randy
Barnes and the 1992 4x100-meter relay member Dennis Mitchell _ were
suspended by track and field's world governing body for possible
doping offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, American swimmers and coaches said they thought that
Smith's ban was a sign that FINA's assertive new doping control
program was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think FINA is doing the right thing with its out of
competition testing program,'' Carol Zaleski, president of the
United States Swimming Federation, said in an interview.
``Obviously people who are using things they shouldn't are most
likely to be caught there rather than in a competitive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Games, Janet Evans, along with other American
coaches and swimmers, questioned the legitimacy of Smith's
performances because she had moved to the top of international
competition at a relatively late age and after a mediocre career.
For instance, she was not ranked among the top 25 swimmers at any
distance, for any stroke, as late as 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Further suspicions were raised by the fact that her husband,
Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower, had been suspended by track
and field's world governing body for excessive levels of
testosterone, the male sex hormone that can also be used as a
muscle-building steroid. Both Smith and her husband said that her
performances were improved by weight lifting and by using the
training techniques of track and field athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all the rumors; I tried to keep an open mind,''
Zaleski said. ``At that point, everything was circumstantial. The
fact that her urine sample was manipulated gives credence to those
suspicions. The kind of improvement she showed a couple of years
prior to the Olympics, based on her age, was extremely unusual. The
coaching community was up in arms about her. But, again, there was
no proof of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin Thursday, Jim McDaid, Ireland's sports minister, said
that Smith's ban was a ``personal tragedy for the swimmer and her
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the rest of the Irish people, I'm saddened and
disappointed by this development,'' McDaid said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish swimming federation said it accepted FINA's ruling,
pending the outcome of an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this is the first case of a drug-related penalty in the
104-year history of Irish swimming, it is the source of major
concern to everyone in the Irish swimming community,'' the
statement said.

FEDS CRASH ALLEGED DRUG CORRIDOR BETWEEN OHIO, TEXAS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Federal prosecutors said Thursday that a
21-year-old man led a drug-supply operation using trucks, buses,
and overnight delivery services to move marijuana and cash between
here and Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the suspected ringleader, 23 people are accused
of participating in the operation. Seventeen people, including
several family members, were behind bars here late Thursday as
authorities hunted for the remaining suspects, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family that plays together stays together,'' Moreno said.
``We're still hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Alonzo Ramirez, 21, also was charged by Texas
authorities with murder. Federal agents arrested him, his
common-law wife and other family members on a ranch west of Laredo
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allegedly running a drug gang, Ramirez is accused
of killing a truck driver whose bullet-riddled body was left on the
streets of a Laredo residential neighborhood in June.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Aubrey Baker was found five days after he was caught
with more than 200 pounds of marijuana, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's another Tony Montana. He's a punk, big and
ugly,'' said Laredo Police Lt. Ismael Alardin, comparing Ramirez to
the Miami drug lord in the movie ``Scarface.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who has a shaved head and is more than six feet tall,
has had previous brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came as part of a 30-month operation aimed at the
smuggling and money-laundering. A federal indictment unsealed
Wednesday alleges that Ramirez ran a criminal enterprise that,
since 1992, moved marijuana and cocaine between Laredo and Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   More than a ton of marijuana was stashed in tractor-trailer rigs
and in luggage shipped on commercial buses, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, United Parcel Service and Airborne Express
delivery services were unwittingly used to ship crates and boxes of
narcotics, according to the indictment. Drugs also were allegedly
hidden in acetylene tanks used in welding.
</P>
<P>
   Profits were sent back to Laredo using a stream of Western Union
transfers that were disguised by using other people's names,
according to the indictment. The transfers were kept at $2,000 or
less to avoid attracting the attention of the authorities, and some
were as little as $100, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was implicated in Baker's murder by one defendant whose
confession was videotaped by the Laredo police, according to a
state arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez faces up to life in prison if convicted of running a
criminal enterprise, and he faces 12 other federal charges
including drug possession and distribution, and money laundering
for trying to hide the alleged illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others named in the indictment were 11 Laredo
residents, including five of Ramirez's family members, and two
sisters in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was the lead agency in
the operation, and aiding it were the Customs Service, the Internal
Revenue Service, the FBI and the Laredo police.

BAKER TO LEAVE CELLUCCI POST TO LEAD HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cellucci Administration suffered the defection of
one of its key cabinet members Thursday when Charles D. Baker Jr. _
once touted as a lieutenant governor candidate this year _ said
that he is stepping down as secretary of administration and finance
to become president and chief executive officer of Harvard Vanguard
Medical Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely an unknown to the general public, Baker achieved
renown within state government as one of the most effective and
influential figures of the Weld-Cellucci era. He is considered by
many as among the smartest people in state government, and his
departure, set for Aug. 1, was immediately cited by some observers
as evidence of an impending `brain drain' at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 41, said he is leaving because the position at Harvard
Vanguard, a medical wing of Harvard Pilgrim Health Plan, was too
good an opportunity to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few jobs in health care that I consider jobs
you simply have to take, and this job for me is one of them,'' he
said Thursday. ``They have some of the very best physicians in the
world as part of their practice, and the opportunity to work with
them was something I felt I had to take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   As A&AMP;F secretary, Baker had been responsible for most fiscal
matters in state government. Despite never having run for office,
Baker was courted to become running mate to Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci, but ultimately decided not to attempt to make the switch
from bureaucrat to elected politician. The spot eventually went to
Jane Swift, a former state senator from North Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci heaped praise on Baker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to express my appreciation on behalf of the people of
Massachusetts for the outstanding job Charlie Baker has done,''
Cellucci said. ``Although he will be leaving state government, he
will continue to be one of my very close friends and one of my key
advisors.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's departure had been expected for months, and Cellucci
said he did not try to talk him into staying. Cellucci said Baker
might return to state government on a part-time basis, serving on a
state board or commission.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he interviewed for the job in late June, and from
that point recused himself from issues involving the health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Baker who earned $82,000 in government, would not say how much
he will be paid in his new post. He begins Sept. 1, the day after
he leaves the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he would name a replacement in the next week to 10
days. He said he would consider candidates from both inside and
outside the government. He added that he already had some ideas,
though he would not name contenders. Assistant Secretary Lowell R.
Richards 3d was immediately named as a frontrunner by
administration sources.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is given major credit for many of the policy initiatives
of the past seven years, including welfare reform, overhauling
regulations in state government, and reforming medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of Health and Human Services, from 1991 to 1994,
Baker presided over deep cuts prompted by the state's fiscal
crisis. Yet he won admirers among liberals and conservatives alike
for his deft management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is smart, rigorous and he's just extraordinarily
able,'' said Judy Meredith, a veteran human services lobbyist.
``He's a bureaucrat in the best sense of the word. He's also the
most charming slash-and-burn artist that this human services
advocate has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being a fiscal conservative, Baker was noted for his
accessibility and support for social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the go-to person for issues of the poor and the
homeless,'' said Philip Mangano, director of the Massachusetts
Housing and Shelter Alliance. ``He brought the brain and the heart
together in dealing with public policy and that's unusual. What a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said Baker would be a big loss to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to see him go because he's so much fun to deal
with,'' Meredith said. ``It's such a severe brain drain. He'll
certainly add an enormous amount of class to the HMO industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates was founded in January as a
nonprofit by 900 physicians and other health care types who provide
service to Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The company provided care
for nearly 300,000 patients, according to Dr. Gene Lindsey, the
chairman of its board.

 &HT;    AirTran union threatens selective strikes
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Contract talks between AirTran and its flight
attendants have broken down, and the union representing the workers
says it is ready to start selective strikes Sept. 5 _ around the
Labor Day holiday _ if significant progress isn't made by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve what other flight attendants in the industry take
for granted,'' said William Green Jr., president of the Association
of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 400 of AirTran's flight attendants,
is seeking pay increases, caps on medical insurance premiums and an
end to ``discriminatory'' rules it says treat flight attendants
less favorably than pilots and mechanics, most of whom are male.
Most AirTran flight attendants are female.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran officials say talks broke down because the AFA is
insisting the company ``force all flight attendants to join the
union.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sticking points appears to be a ``union security''
proposal that nonunion flight attendants be required to pay a $39
monthly fee because they would benefit from some union programs,
such as training and safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our flight attendants have specifically stated that
they do not desire to be a member of the union,'' said Thomas
Kalil, senior vice president of operations and customer service.
``Consequently, we do not feel it is fair to make complete
unionization compulsory, as the AFA is proposing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not insisting that everyone become a member,'' said
union spokesman Steve Francy. ``Both the male-dominated pilots
group and mechanics group have union security clauses in their
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board has ruled the contract talks are at
an impasse. A 30-day, cooling-off period is in effect until Sept.
5,
</P>
<P>
   and the flight attendants can call a strike that day.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA began representing its flight attendants in 1995 and has
been negotiating a contract ever since. Talks have been in
mediation since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Francy says the two sides have made progress on some areas,
including training, scheduling procedures and sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues remain unresolved, such as regular breaks for
flight attendants and the service fee.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse comes as AirTran prepares to expand its schedule
this fall, shifting more nonstop flights from its headquarters in
Orlando to Hartsfield International Airport. In doing so, the
company says it will be hiring more employees, especially flight
attendants.

 &HT;    Amid tough union talks, BellSouth wins service award
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- BellSouth Corp. for the third consecutive year has
won the J.D. Power and Associates award for best customer service
by a local phone company _ news BellSouth has trumpeted in past
marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This time, that award from the international consulting company
comes with BellSouth reaching crunch time in its high-stakes
contract talks with the union representing most of its workers, and
with the Atlanta-based regional company readying itself for
increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power has only ranked local phone companies three times.
BellSouth has won each time, and its lead over the second-place
finisher has grown. Last year, BellSouth beat out PacTel. This
time, second place went to Cincinnati Bell, with PacTel and
Southern New England Telephone tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   The award gauges customer service _ just as BellSouth officials
sat at bargaining tables with the union representing most of the
company's service employees, including operators and technicians.
Those talks face a deadline: At 11:59 p.m. Saturday, the contract
covering 48,000 workers represented by the Communications Workers
of America expires, and the union side is armed with the
authorization of its members to call a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smith, CWA vice president for the Southeast, said he wants
BellSouth to make the connection clear between the workers he
represents and the J.D. Power award. Smith says he wants the union
and its workers to share in the good fortunes of the company, which
has reported a long string of record profits.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has about 86,000 workers. Most represented by the CWA
are working for BellSouth Telecommunications, the phone unit that
supplies local service to the nine Southeastern states. Charles
Coe, president of BellSouth Telecommunications, said he sees no
connection between the contract negotiations and the J.D. Power
award. However, he said management is aware of its dependence on
its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees, particularly our front-line employees, are the
best in the business,'' he said. ``We make no secret of the fact
that they deserve the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks will produce a new contract, despite the differences that
remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials have said the biggest obstacles to a pact are
pension and other retirement benefits, compulsory overtime and the
use of non-company workers.
</P>
<P>
   Power's rankings were based on a study of more than 14,000
households, said Peter Dresch, director of telecommunications
market analysis for J.D. Power. He called the results especially
promising for a company like BellSouth, whose long-standing
monopoly is expected to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of companies have filed for local service competition
against BellSouth. In metro Atlanta, BellSouth faces about a dozen
competitors in the local service market, all selling only to
businesses except MGC Communications and MediaOne.

 &HT;    Delta expanding service to large business centers
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines has announced a major expansion of
its daily flights to major business centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business customers have demanded more service to key
cities, and Delta is responding,'' said President and Chief
Executive Officer Leo F. Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, who made the announcement at the Metro Atlanta Chamber
of Commerce, said many Delta flights at Hartsfield International
Airport routinely have load factors, or the percentage of seats
filled, exceeding 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 1, Delta will add 21 flights. As a result, the
airline will have 633 daily flights from Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Hourly service will begin to Boston and Newark. Also, there will
be more flights to New York's LaGuardia, Baltimore and Washington
Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   Delta will also start service to Chicago's Midway Airport, in
addition to existing service to Chicago's O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers account for more than half the passengers to
the markets being expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Delta has also been cutting or eliminating flights to some
smaller markets, including Toledo, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and
Columbia, S.C. As a result, Thursday's announcement means a net
increase of 11 flights, Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin also pressed for fifth and sixth runways at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated right now because I feel progress is being
made,'' he said. In July, a record 2.5 million passengers flew
Delta in Atlanta.

APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS CHILD-PORN CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal appeals court has overturned the conviction
of a Maine man who allegedly crossed state lines intending to have
sex with children, a case developed by a well-known New Hampshire
``cybercop'' who's made a career of snaring on-line predators.
</P>
<P>
   While the case before the US Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit in Boston involved old-fashioned solicitation -- the
defendant, Paul George Gamache had answered an ad in a swingers
magazine -- the ad was placed by Keene, N.H. detective James
McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's targeting of Internet chat rooms, particularly ones
frequented by pedophiles, has resulted in the arrest of more than
70 men, including some from overseas, on sex charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit's tactics, which include detectives like McLaughlin
posing as children on-line, has drawn the criticism of civil
libertarians who say such high-tech crimefighting has veered into
entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the First Circuit said jurors are entitled to consider
that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   While not ruling on the legality of police officers luring
pedophiles via computer chat rooms, the court found that defendants
like Gamache are entitled to argue before a jury that they were
entrapped. During Gamache's trial, the judge prohibited his
attorney, Michael J. Sheehan, from presenting an entrapment defense
and jurors were not told they could consider one.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache, then a 55-year-old service worker with the Maine Yankee
Nuclear Power Plant, answered an ad placed by McLaughlin in
Tri-State Swingers in May 1995. After exchanging a series of
letters with a fictitious woman who said she wanted Gamache to
provide ``sex training'' for her three young children, ages 8
through 12, Gamache agreed to meet her at Keene motel. When he
arrived in the parking lot he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He was later convicted and sentenced to five years in federal
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In its 27-page ruling, the three-judge panel said that Gamache
answered the ad intending to have sex only with the mother and it
was the detectives, who raised, and pursued, the idea of the
children participating.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache, the court noted, had no criminal record and there was
no evidence linking him to child exploitation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the government that first mentioned the children as sex
objects... and it was the government that escalated the subject of
sex with children,'' the court found.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO CITE RENO FOR CONTEMPT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitterly divided House panel voted Thursday to
cite Attorney General Janet Reno for contempt for refusing to turn
over memos that Republicans argue could bolster their case for
appointing an independent counsel to probe alleged Democratic
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee took the
rare step of slapping a Cabinet official with a contempt charge
after Reno refused to turn over written recommendations from FBI
director Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella, who headed a Justice
Department campaign finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   Those memos summarized the status of the probe into alleged
fund-raising abuses stemming from the 1996 presidential election
and recommend that Reno appoint a special prosecutor to pursue the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-19 vote was along party lines, with all Republicans
backing the extraordinary measure and all Democrats and one
independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
The two Texans on the panel split along party lines, with Rep. Jim
Turner, D-Crockett, voting against the measure and Rep. Pete
Sessions, R-Dallas, supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The contempt recommendation now must be taken up by the full
House, which is not expected to consider it until members return
from summer recess in September.
</P>
<P>
   If the full House were to vote for contempt it would then have
to be enforced by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of
Columbia, who reports to the attorney general. The maximum penalty
for contempt is a $100,000 fine or a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote Reno said that she would continue to seek a
compromise with the committee but would not agree to their demands
to turn over the entire memos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply have to draw the line and stand up for what I believe
to be a very important principle; prosecutions must be free of
political influence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has so far refused to appoint an independent counsel,
said that releasing the detailed memos to Congress would compromise
her department's campaign finance investigation because they
contain sensitive information that may be used in the prosecution
of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   She had offered to brief the lawmakers on the contents of the
memo at the end of this month after she has analyzed the LaBella
memo, which was given to her in July.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans on the committee, led by their combative
chairman Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., refused to accept Reno's offer
and countered that it was merely part of the Clinton
administration's history of stonewalling Congress when it comes to
turning over sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the committee needed the memos to determine whether
Reno was following the law regarding the appointment of an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it appears that the attorney general is not upholding the
law, then the people have a right to know what's happening,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats countered that Burton was merely trying to grab
headlines and revive an investigation that has been plagued by a
series of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting of the committee is being staged in the hope of
doing something drastic. We will appear relevant once again. The
guiding principle seems to be that it's better to be reckless and
extreme than to be ignored,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the
ranking Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had the same level of intense partisan rancor that
has infected the committee since it launched the investigation last
year. At one point when Burton referred to the ``historic''
significance of the contempt move, the Democrats burst out
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats argued that it would be imprudent to turn over the
documents to the committee, noting that Freeh and LaBella testified
earlier this week that such a move could harm the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans responded that they informed Reno that she could
black out information in the memos. Furthermore, they said that the
memos would only be read by members of the committee and not made
public.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats responded that the committee has had a history of
leaking confidential information, Republicans retorted that the
existence of the Freeh and LaBella memos were leaked to the media
by Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno later denied that she or any of her subordinates leaked
those memos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the pain it's caused me, that's the most
ridiculous thing I've heard of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that in the next three weeks she will review her
previous decision last fall not to appoint an independent counsel
in light of the LaBella memo.
</P>
<P>
   If she appoints a special prosecutor, the House almost surely
would not take up the contempt charges.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that the committee's action Thursday marked the
first time that a congressional committee had cited an attorney
general for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is not the first time that such drastic action has
been taken against other executive branch officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the House Energy and Commerce Committee cited Reagan's
Interior Secretary James Watt for contempt for refusing to produce
documents regarding Canadian energy and investment policies. The
charge was not taken up by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The same year the full House voted to cite Environmental
Protection Agency chief Ann Gorsuch for contempt for refusing to
turn over documents regarding the superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the House Intelligence Committee cited Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger for contempt, but that matter was resolved a
few hours before the full House was to vote.

HEARINGS PROBE INFORMANT'S CREDIBILITY WITH FBI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Had he known that mob informant Angelo ``Sonny''
Mercurio didn't warn the FBI about the planned assassination of
boss Francis Salemme in June 1989, an FBI agent who vouched for
Mercurio's credibility before a federal judge might have viewed him
differently.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Walter J. Steffens Jr., testified in federal court
Thursday that ``if Mr. Mercurio had been involved in the shooting
of Frankie Salemme and failed to notify the FBI ahead of time that
the shooting would take place, then, yes, that would have affected
his reliability'' as a bureau informant.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio's ``reliability'' is at issue because Steffens, an
agent formerly assigned to the bureau's organized crime squad in
Boston, signed an affidavit in October 1989 which portrayed
Mercurio as a trusted informant.
</P>
<P>
   And that affidavit helped convince a federal judge to issue a
``roving bug'' _ a wide-ranging listening device that was used to
make a first-ever recording of a Mafia induction ceremony on Oct.
29, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony before Judge Mark Wolf Thursday, Steffens made
it clear that he was kept in the dark even as he prepared court
papers for submission to US District Judge David S. Nelson, who
authorized the roving bug.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens testified that at the time, he was unaware of two
facts: that Mercurio told FBI supervisor James Ring the time and
place of the ceremony hours before Steffens met with Nelson, and
that the bureau had a witness who was willing to wear a hidden
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nelson might not have authorized the roving bug if he
thought investigators could get evidence that way, Steffens said.
The legality of the bugging is being challenged on two fronts in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme, who survived the botched hit outside a Saugus pancake
house, wants the tape thrown out as evidence. So do his
co-defendants, mob soldier Robert DeLuca and Winter Hill gangsters
Stephen Flemmi and John Martorano. Winter Hill leader James
``Whitey'' Bulger, &UR;  &LR; the fifth defendant, fled before he was
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The recording, which established for the first time the
existence of La Cosa Nostra, underpins the landmark 1995 indictment
that accuses the local Mafia and the Winter Hill gang of a
decades-long conspiracy to carve up the region's rackets.
</P>
<P>
   The same tape recording is being challenged in a different case
involving 15 mobsters and associates who engaged in a bloody,
five-year battle to topple Salemme in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf must decide whether Nelson was given accurate and complete
information at the time the bug was authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argue that the government should have told
Nelson that the FBI knew the exact time and location of the
induction ceremony _ a house in Medford on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than request permission to plant listening devices in
that house alone, the government sought a roving bug, which isn't
tied to a specific location and is designed for organized crime
figures who avoid meeting at a specific place. The induction
ceremony was never mentioned to Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the lead prosecutor in the case testified that she
doubted that the mobsters would hold the secret ceremony in a
suburban neighborhood on a Sunday morning _ and, in any case, the
FBI had asked her not to mention it to protect Mercurio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government wanted the roving bug so it could
continue eavesdropping on the conversations of mob consigliere
Joseph J.R. Russo and capo regimes Vincent Ferrara and Robert
Carrozza for up to 30 days, regardless of where they met.
 &UR;  &LR; However, no conversations were intercepted after the induction
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Under several hours of questioning by DeLuca's lawyer, Randolph
Gioia, Steffens acknowledged that Mercurio _ who reportedly had
planned the attempted murder of Salemme along with Ferrara,
Carrozza and Russo _ was not a target of the bug, even though he
was described in the application as being ``responsible for murder
and racketeering.''

WITNESS TO GIRL'S ASSAULT FACES WRATH OF SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Yolanda Manuel's little girl is dead, and David
Cash is about to start his sophomore year in college. The murder
trial begins a week before classes.
</P>
<P>
   Cash is not charged with killing 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson. A
young man he calls his best friend is. But Manuel says it might as
well have been Cash's fist over her daughter's mouth, his hands
around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has admitted he was in the Nevada casino restroom moments
before Sherrice died. He says he saw his friend, Jeremy Strohmeyer,
struggle with her in a stall. Then Cash left. Now, more than a year
later, he says he never thinks of the girl, and that his newfound
notoriety has helped him meet women.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Cash may be home free. Las Vegas police say he violated
no state law. But his refusal to help Sherrice has triggered a
campaign to make him an outcast among his college peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Cash has been saying horrible things,'' Manuel said.
``He says he cries over no one. He mentions that he wants to go to
school and get girls and I don't think that's the place he needs to
be. He needs to be in jail. You don't do nothing when a child -- a
child -- is getting her life taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   But, calling Cash an accessory to her daughter's May 1997
murder, Manuel has launched a petition drive demanding that some
form of criminal charge be filed against him. With her blessing,
two radio talk show hosts in Los Angeles are also planning to make
his life miserable on campus, since it is unlikely he will be
expelled for his inaction.
</P>
<P>
   University officials ``are behind me, baby,'' Cash, 19, told the
radio duo on KLSX-FM last week. Later in the broadcast, he added,
``There is no chance I will go to jail, simply because I have done
nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrice's mother, as well as radio hosts Tim Conway Jr. and
Douglas Steckler, say otherwise. They say Cash should have stopped
Strohmeyer, 20, or gone for help. Now they want him punished, if
not by Nevada authorities, if not by university administrators,
then by them.
</P>
<P>
   When Cash returns to the University of California at Berkeley
later this month, Conway and Steckler intend to greet him with a
busload or two of pickets. They plan to distribute fliers. Their
aim: to drive the aspiring nuclear engineer from class by making
him a pariah among fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations will coincide with Strohmeyer's trial, slated
to begin Aug. 17. Cash, who, like Strohmeyer, grew up in relative
affluence in Long Beach, is expected to testify. Yolanda Manuel,
who lives in South-Central Los Angeles, is trying to raise enough
money to attend the Las Vegas trial of the man accused of sexually
molesting and killing her only child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will demonstrate at the school, at his house; we will
demand justice,'' said Irv Rubin, who is national chairman of the
Jewish Defense League and is involved in the upcoming protest as a
friend of the radio duo. ``You can call me a vigilante; you can
call me anything you want...''
</P>
<P>
   University officials, however, say Cash has the same right to
his education as any student. After all, he faces no formal
charges, since failing to report a crime or refusing to help a
victim is not against the law. Spokesman Jesus Mena also noted that
Cash's class was admitted to the elite institution in March 1977,
two months before the May 25 murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are morally outraged that this young man probably had
the opportunity to do something to save this young lady's life and
they want there to be some type of remedy for their indignation,''
said Stewart Bell, the district attorney in Clark County, Nevada,
where Strohmeyer will be tried. ``But the remedy for what he did
requires a response from a higher authority. That will require
divine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   What set Conway and Steckler off, they say, was Cash's decision
to leave the murder scene than his actions and statements to the
Los Angeles Times afterward. By his own admission, Cash did not
turn in his friend when Strohmeyer became a suspect. He did not
regret keeping quiet. Instead, he told the newspaper, his
connection to the case gave him a kind of cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe that this kid, who could have prevented a
death, not only decided not to do anything about it but that he's
going to use it to score with chicks,'' said Conway, whose popular
radio show airs from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. weeknights. ``We want
everybody on campus to know exactly what kind of person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the air in a show filled with profanity, Cash did say he was
sorry for the Iverson family. But again he denied any feelings for
Sherrice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tragic event, OK,'' Cash said on the radio. ``But
the simple fact rmains I do not know this little girl. I do not
know starving children in Panama. I do not know people that die of
disease in Egypt. The only person I knew in this event was Jeremy
Strohgmeyer and I know as his best friend that he had potential. .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad,'' he added, ``that I lost a best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier he had told the Times he was not upset when Strohmeyer
told him what he had done; later, however, he was furious when
their high school refused to allow him to attend graduation or the
prom. He showed up outside anyway, in a rented limousine. The
moment, Cash standing in the sunroof, his fist raised as if in
triumph, was captured on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get upset over somebody else's life. . .,''
Cash is quoted as saying in the Times. ``I'm not going to lose
sleep over somebody else's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Conway, who has received hundreds of e-mails from listeners
offended by Cash's comments, ``It's unbelievable that he's going to
be getting his degree when he should be in prison as an accomplice
to murder. . .If we don't do anything else, we're going to make him
quit school.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash, who testified before a grand jury, could not be reached by
the Globe for comment. But he has not disputed the outline of the
accusations against Strohmeyer -- although, on the radio, he called
them ``out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   According to law enforcement authorities, Cash followed
Strohmeyer into the bathroom of the Primadonna casino, about 40
miles south of Las Vegas. The young men were there with Cash's
father; Sherrice and her 14-year-old half brother were with theirs.
All four had been playing in a casino arcade. It was almost 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cash allegedly watched Strohmeyer carry Sherrice into a stall,
his hand over her mouth, then lock the door. He told the grand jury
that he tried to get his friend's attention and make him stop.
Then, as Sherrice struggled, he nonchalantly left the restroom and
the arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the two allegedly made a pact to tell no one what had
occurred, to deny it even when local TV stations played the
surveillance camera videotape of them entering the bathroom. Other
students called police to report their suspicions, but Cash kept
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   He told KLSX, ``I did not want to be the one who takes away my
best friend's last day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law needs to be amended or rewritten because David Cash is
guilty of something,'' said Najee Ali, executive director of the
Los Angeles-based Project Islamic Hope, which is helping Manuel
raise signatures for her petition and $10,000 for her trip to Las
Vegas. ``This issue has crossed over religious and racial lines.
People are just sickened by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Reiner, the former district attorney for Los Angeles County,
said the ``facts are thin'' to charge Cash. But he believes
Berkeley could have rescinded Cash's admission, a process based in
part on moral character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of him at the prom shows you everything you ever
need to know about this person,'' said Reiner. ``The school looked
at that and said, ``Yeah, this is the kind of person we want at
Berkeley.' That's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Manuel has plenty to say to prosecutors and to
university administrators. But at first she had nothing to say to
David Cash. Then she took a deep breath and berated him like any
mother might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to tell this young man that, whatever he does in
his life, he always better believe that there's a god somewhere
watching over him, his evilness.'' she said. ``You had a chance to
save my girl's life, to go out and tell the security guard, some
adult, that something was going wrong. How could you choose the way
you did?''

CELLUCCI SIGNS TOUGH NEW TEEN DRIVING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The numbers are startling: Almost half of the state's
16-year-old drivers were involved in an accident last year, as were
nearly a quarter of 17-year-old motorists. Two-thirds of the
teenagers killed in car accidents are in vehicles driven by another
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, flanked by families who have lost loved ones in auto
accidents, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci signed a law to change
that grim reality by dramatically restricting teenagers' driving
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which takes effect in 90 days, will require more
training and parental supervision for teenage drivers, forbid their
unsupervised late-night driving, and prohibit them from having
other teenagers in the car for the first six months of their
licensing unless accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics show that too many teens are reckless when they
drive,'' said Cellucci. ``This new law will help prevent teen
drivers from being a hazard to themselves and others.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the new statute is to give teenage drivers more
experience behind the wheel before they are put in distracting or
dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Christine Reif, mother of 16-year-old Ricky
Harrington, who died in a 1995 car accident that also claimed the
lives of two other youths, said such a law could spare other
families the pain hers had suffered. The driver, a 17-year-old, had
his license fewer than four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one family is spared the pain of a teen tragedy, if one
parent does not get the call that every parent dreads and the words
that I will never stop hearing in my head _ `your child is dead' _
if one parent is spared the trip to the morgue to identify the
child who had held so much promise and had everything to live for,
then the graduated license law will be a success,'' said Reif.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in hushed tones, Shawn O'Connell of Brookfield talked
of carelessly causing a fatal accident five years ago, when as a
16-year-old driver he tried to speed away from the car behind him,
lost control, and crashed into an oncoming vehicle, killing a woman
and severely injuring her young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent the last four years of my life living with this
every single day, that I have devastated a family and countless
others,'' said O'Connell, who said the new law could help other
young drivers get the experience they need to prevent such
occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, to get a junior operator's license, anyone
under 18 will have to participate in a driver's education class,
which must include 12 hours of supervised driving with a parent.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months after a teenager gets a license, he or
she cannot have another teenager in the car unless accompanied by
an adult sitting in the front seat. Further, no one under 18 will
be allowed to drive between midnight and 5 a.m. unless accompanied
by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Only when a young driver turns 18 can he or she trade in the
junior driver's license for full driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will also specify six-month license suspensions for
any teenager convicted of driving under the influence, attempting
to purchase alcohol, or drag racing.

FCC GIVES REGIONAL BELLS OK ON DATA SERVICE SUBSIDIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regional telephone companies, banned from entering the
long-distance telephone market, got Thursday what might be
considered a consolation prize: A potential chance to provide
high-speed data service to homes and businesses in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said it would consider
allowing each regional Bell company to create a separate subsidiary
to provide advanced data services. What makes this a prize is that
these subsidiaries would not have to sell their data services to
competitors at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, regional phone companies are mandated to resell their
telephone services to rivals at discount prices. But under FCC
rules aimed at encouraging investment in new technology, the Bell
companies would not be required to resell their data services to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   These high-speed data services would allow consumers in their
homes to instantaneously open World Wide Web pages with the click
of the button, instead of waiting minutes using much slower modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening up and unleashing the power of these high-capacity
networks to promote (electronic) commerce, we are going to improve
the lives of American consumers in this country,'' said FCC
chairman William Kennard, adding that the nation's $20 billion
electronic commerce business will grow to $350 billion in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   While few disputed Kennard's optimism, Bell Atlantic and some of
its rivals had serious doubts about the structure of FCC's plan,
which will undergo public scrutiny in the next 60 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which in January was among the first local phone
companies to ask the FCC for permission to launch a high-speed data
network, said the FCC's decision will not help consumers
immediately because of regulatory limitations on subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the (FCC) action falls far short of the `giant
leap' required to deploy advanced telecommunications services to
all Americans,'' said Tom Tauke, Bell Atlantic's senior vice
president for government relations.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and MCI said they were opposed to Bell Atlantic and
the other regional phone companies establishing subsidiaries to
carry high-speed data traffic, claiming that only separate
ownership would protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials said the subsidiary plan, as outlined by the FCC
Thursday, would still allow the Bell companies to use their
enormous monopoly power to favor their own data network operations.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sallet, MCI's chief policy counsel, said allowing Bell
Atlantic the chance to get into data networking through a
company-owned subsidiary ``is like paying yourself to park in your
own garage: you can pay $1 or $1 million because it ends up all
staying with you.'' Sallet said MCI would oppose the FCC subsidiary
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Congressman Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the ranking
Democrat on the House Telecommunications subcomittee, praised the
FCC's ruling, saying it promotes competition under the 1996
Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the FCC polices the separate subsidiaries and
offers equal treatment to every other company seeking to create
data networks, this policy should work for both Bell Atlantic and
MCI,'' said Markey. ``If a regional Bell company tried to block out
a competitor, then MCI or AT&AMP;T should blow the whistle on them at
that time.''

ADVERTISING: SUCCESS OF TACO BELL TALKING CHIHUAHUA ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one expresses more surprise about the success of
the Taco Bell talking Chihuahua than those who created the quirky
character.
</P>
<P>
   In just a year, the dog has earned a place alongside such adland
instant phenomena as the doubting youngster named Mikey of the Life
cereal commercials; the skeptical old woman named Clara Peller who
bellowed, ``Where's the beef?''; the smarmy guy who tried to cadge
limousine rides and free Bud Light by passing himself off as
someone important, and the battery-powered Energizer bunny that
keeps ``going and going and going.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog has appeared on the annual ``It List'' of hot trends
compiled by Entertainment Weekly magazine, has been profiled in the
Spanish-language People magazine and appeared on the
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood'' television
shows. It is even showing up on merchandise like T-shirts and hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised that the campaign became as popular as it
did and as quickly as it did,'' said Clay Williams, the copywriter
on the account. He is a managing partner and creative director at
the Venice, Calif., office of TBWA Chiat/Day, the Taco Bell agency.
</P>
<P>
   But now the challenge for TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA
Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, is to keep its Chihuahua from
becoming a one-shot wonder that will soon be relegated to the
``Where are they now?'' corner of Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Chihuahua was introduced in early July 1997 as part of an
umbrella campaign for Taco Bell, a chain owned by Tricon Global
Restaurants. Only one of the four commercials in the campaign
showed the Chihuahua, which was pursuing Taco Bell food and
proclaiming, ``Yo quiero Taco Bell'' (``I want Taco Bell''). The
campaign carried the theme ``Want some?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do something right, your customers let you know
immediately,'' said Vada Hill, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell
in Irvine, Calif. ``Once they saw the first ad, they wanted to see
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea has always been that the dog personifies the feeling
that customers have about our food, and the relationship that they
have with our brand. For as long as we remain true to that, we will
have a winning campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   So the ``Want some?'' theme was played down in favor of the
bug-eyed dog's ``Yo quiero Taco Bell.'' The first commercial with
the dog as the star ran later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Now the character has appeared in 15 commercials, performing
stunts as varied as taking on Godzilla and leading a revolution.
The common thread: ``the dog's relentless pursuit for Taco Bell
food,'' said Chuck Bennett, Williams' art director partner, who is
also a managing partner and creative director at TBWA Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Taco Bell does not disclose spending for individual campaigns,
but it spends an estimated $200 million annually in media
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   How and why did this funny-looking dog become such a hit?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that ``we don't treat the dog as a dog,'' Williams
said. ``We treat him as a 19-year-old trapped in a dog's body,'' he
said. ``He's a cool character that happens to be a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett agreed, saying, ``People see themselves in the dog,''
and they want to see what the dog will do next.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage that, Bennett said, a guide was written so the
Chihuahua behaves consistently in all ads. The contents include
information about the dog, which has no owner and lives in a
tropical world, and what it does and does not do as a free spirit
about town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat the campaign like a sitcom with the dog as the lead
character,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be seen in another series of spots to be introduced
sometime this month, showing the dog's single-minded devotion to
eating at Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   To help avoid overkill, which can turn the public against a
character, Williams said, the agency intended to make sure the dog
``doesn't become a spokesperson for Taco Bell and that he is still
a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added, ``It's really important that he represents the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stack, vice president for public affairs at Taco Bell, who
heads licensed-merchandise efforts for the company, said that
merchandise bearing images of the Chihuahua would be limited to
``merchandise that only enhances the brand and reaches our core
consumers in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 44, and Williams, 37, have been collaborating at TBWA
Chiat/Day for three years. Other campaigns they have worked on
include the ``Enjoy the ride'' ads for the Nissan Motor Corp. USA,
which never garnered anywhere near the attention of the Taco Bell
campaign despite the presence of a Jack Russell terrier in the arms
of the K character who represented Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't watch commercials,'' William said. ``They watch
what's interesting to them. So as long as we do our job in keeping
the Chihuahua and campaign interesting, and not so much force a
sales message down their throats, people will continue to embrace
our approach.''

SHARP DROP NOTED IN EXPORTS FROM BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts exports fell sharply in the first
quarter, providing fresh evidence that Asia's weak currencies and
shrinking economies are eating into demand for goods manufactured
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state exported $4.245 billion in goods during the first
three months of the year, a decline of &UR;  &LR; $278.3 million, or 6.1
percent, from the final three months of 1997, according to Alliance
for the Commonwealth, a business group that tracks exports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a big quarterly drop, exports in the January-March
quarter were actually $98.9 million higher than exports in the same
quarter of 1997. But that slim 2.4 percent rise over the year was
markedly slower than the 6.1 percent rise in US exports overall,
the report said. It may in part reflect the state's heavy reliance
on sales of computers and components to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore have been hardest
hit among the state's trading partners. Purchases by those
countries of everything from semiconductor equipment and computers
to scrap brass fell by $139.4 million over the past year. Exports
to Canada, the state's biggest trading partner, were also off.
Appreciation of the US dollar against that country's dollar made
American products extremely expensive in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first statistical evidence we have statewide that
there's an impact in Massachusetts'' of the Asian economic
collapse, said Charles McChesney, the Alliance's executive
director. ``I'm anxious about the second-quarter numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter drop in Massachusetts exports is the steepest
in a single quarter since the Mexican peso collapse cut into
exports to the Nafta trading partner two years ago, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the peso crisis, which caused a downward blip in
exports and was followed by record growth in exports, some
economists and trade experts fear that the Asia-induced export
slump may be more enduring.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic troubles have not yet had a big impact on the
state's exports, though the extent of that country's economic
troubles is still unfolding. Exports to Japan, the state's
second-biggest customer, were ``down slightly,'' the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to predict whether Massachusetts exports will
continue to fall in future quarters. Overall, the state's economy
is still strong _ it is expected to grow by more than 3.5 percent
this year _ and the jobless rate remains at record lows.
</P>
<P>
   But there is increasing evidence of weakness, especially in the
electronics sector. LTX Corp., a Westwood supplier to the
semiconductor industry, said this week that it would lay off 300
employees _ nearly a third of its work &UR;  &LR; force _ due to a downturn
in demand from Asian customers. Stratus Computer Inc.'s stock
plunged in June after it said that a downturn in Asia's demand for
its sophisticated computers had hurt profits; the company announced
a merger with Ascend Communications this week.
</P>
<P>
   The export report contained hints that Massachusetts' economy,
with its cluster of computer and high-technology companies around
Boston, may be more vulnerable than the nation to Asia's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts exports in the second-quarter were 2.4 percent
higher than exports in the second quarter of 1997. That pace of
growth was significantly below the 6.1 percent increase in exports
by all US companies.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit shot up in May to a record $15.8
billion, and US economic growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the
April-June quarter, its smallest growth rate in three years. US
companies are beginning to report weaker profits in their
second-quarter reports. Some companies laying off workers site
reduced demand from their Asian customers.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly diverse base of global customers has helped
Massachusetts, however. While exports to Asia and Canada were hit
hard, Mexico purchased $37 million more in goods in the first
quarter of the year than the country did a year ago. Exports to the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland, as well as China _ the
country has not yet devalued its currency _ were also ``up
smartly,'' the report said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEASIDE, Calif. _ Nestled alongside this small town on the
Monterey Peninsula is the old Fort Ord, a sprawling Army post on
the Pacific Ocean, once home to 36,000 people but rendered obsolete
by the round of military base closings several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the community has scarcely one-tenth of its former
population, and when people who work nearby return every night to
Spartan homes among abandoned buildings, the streets are so quiet
that even a soft breeze makes a racket.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is quieter than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two months, 13-year-old Christina Marie Williams has
been missing. The youngest in a family of five that lives in a
house on a sleepy cul-de-sac, Christina took her dog, Greg, for a
walk in the neighborhood on the evening of June 12. About a
half-hour later, Greg wandered back alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, witnesses reported seeing two men in an
old sedan lurking in the area before and after Christina and the
dog went walking. One woman told the authorities she saw a girl who
matched Christina's description sitting in the car, looking
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Those sightings, unusual for a kidnapping case, enabled the
federal authorities to develop sketches of the men and the car they
were driving. But in the seven weeks since Christina disappeared,
the drawings remain all they have to go on. That, and fervent
prayers that Northern California does not have another Polly Klaas
case on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're stuck in a bad `Twilight Zone' episode,''
Williams said Tuesday, describing anxious weeks when only fitful
sleep brings any relief for him, his wife, Alice, and their two
other children, Jennifer, 18, and Michael, 16. ``You can't get out.
There's no resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams family is hardly alone in its anguish. A recent
study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a
nonprofit organization whose headquarters are in Arlington, Va.,
found that among the nearly 1 million people reported missing last
year were 200 to 300 children who were kidnapped by a stranger.
Ernie Allen, the center's president, said that about two-thirds of
the children were girls 18 or younger, and that half of those
kidnapped were found slain. The others, he said, returned safely or
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 41, is a Navy meteorologist for the Defense Department
who moved his family here last winter after 12 years in Japan and
the Philippines. He has not returned to work since Christina
vanished. His wife finally went back to her job as a housekeeper at
the local Hyatt Regency Hotel this week, just to get her mind off
things for a few hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their home on Nijmegen Street has become Williams'
personal command post. The telephone rings constantly with calls
from law-enforcement officers and well-wishers. Friends stop by.
The stereo, television and family pictures sitting on shelves in
the living room are almost obscured by cards of sympathy and
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   From the bedroom where he keeps his computer, Williams brought
in a stack of printouts, more than 1,400 messages the family has
received electronically from people all over the world. ``Forty
countries so far,'' he said. ``We're getting 50 to 100 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   After Christina disappeared, Williams said one of the first
people to contact his family was Marc Klaas, Polly's father, who
knows a thing or two about the nightmare of a missing young
daughter. His family's case came to a brutal end five years ago
when a man arrested for drunken driving confessed to kidnapping
Polly, who was 12, from a slumber party in her Sonoma County home,
strangling her and leaving her body at an abandoned lumber mill 30
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later the killer, Richard Allen Davis, was convicted
and given a death sentence. He remains in prison while his lawyers
appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Klaas case captured national attention not only for Polly's
age and the brazen acts of the killer, but also for the protocols
employed by law-enforcement agencies after the abduction was
reported. Fearing that news reports of Polly's disappearance would
hinder efforts to find her, investigators in Sonoma County delayed
releasing any information, including a description of the suspect,
his car and the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Left in the dark were two Sonoma County deputies who encountered
Davis on the night of the kidnapping, after a woman called to
complain about a trespasser. They found Davis with a car in a ditch
and questioned him for 30 minutes, then helped him pull the car
onto the road and let him go. Six minutes later, his description
was released. He was not caught for another two months.
</P>
<P>
   The delay and its consequences led to new procedures for child
abduction cases that stressed dispensing information quickly,
widely and continually through fliers, news conferences and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Williams has worked nonstop to keep Christina's
case in the public eye, winning widespread help from friends and
strangers alike. His boss, Paul Brewer, set up a volunteer center.
Celebrities like Clint Eastwood, Mariah Carey and Reggie Jackson
have made public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Christina began here on the Monterey Peninsula,
where investigators were helped by volunteers on horseback, by
psychics and even by people who said they could communicate with
Christina's dog. The search quickly expanded to contiguous counties
and beyond as the San Francisco office of the FBI made the case its
highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have received leads from 50 of our 56 divisions around the
country,'' said Gerald Buten, assistant special agent in charge of
the case, acknowledging the ambiguous impact of such a response.
``That's a positive development from the investigation standpoint.
But she could be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The search has had at least some residual benefits. In recent
weeks, the authorities have found the bodies of three other missing
young women in Northern California counties. At least one discovery
set off rumors that the victim was Christina.
</P>
<P>
   And so the wait goes on.
</P>
<P>
   `'You have to be positive _ you have to have hope,'' Williams
said. `'That's what keeps us going. You can't give up. It's your
child. How could you possibly give up hope on your child?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many negatives,'' he added. ``The only positive
thing to believe is that we'll get her back safely. We just have to
believe we will.''

AUTOMAKER

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Early on the morning of July 28, two heavyweights of
Germany's car industry met at a discreet Bavarian country club for
an extraordinary bout of deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand Piech, the head of Volkswagen AG, flew in on a company
jet. Bernd Pischetsrieder, head of Bayerische Motorenwerke AG,
drove the 60 miles from Munich for the unpublicized 8:30 a.m.
encounter in a BMW 750i, the top model in the company's line.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the two men were about to carve up the world's
most illustrious automotive names, setting the terms for a divorce
of Rolls-Royce and Bentley 67 years after they had merged.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deal that concluded months of acrimonious negotiations
over the future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. _ the British
manufacturer of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars _ since Britain's
Vickers PLC put the company up for sale in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations hinged on what analysts took to be two
critical miscalculations by Volkswagen over who owned the right to
use the Rolls-Royce name, and whose engines would power the
luxurious cars that sell for upwards of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks before the meeting at the Neuburg country club near
Ingolstadt, Volkswagen had seemed to outflank BMW to become the
definitive buyer of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars for about $790
million. But under the new deal, Volkswagen would have the rights
to both names only until January 1, 2003. Thereafter, the
Rolls-Royce name would be BMW's property and Bentley would belong
to Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement highlighted the overwhelming ambitions of German
automakers to break into the rarefied world of luxurious hand-made
automobiles: backed by solid profits, Piech in particular seemed to
have embarked on a personal crusade to acquire his own luxury name
plate _ an ambition matched only by BMW's stubborn refusal to be
dealt out of the prestigious niche.
</P>
<P>
   Both chief executives brought powerful political backers to the
table as referees _ Edmund Stoiber, the state premier of Bavaria,
where BMW has its headquarters, and Gerhard Schroder, a member of
the Volkswagen supervisory board as well as the state premier of
Lower Saxony, where VW is the largest employer, and Social Democrat
candidate for chancellor in national elections seven weeks from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time Pischetsrieder and Piech flew on a few hours
later in the Volkswagen company jet to London to announce their
deal, they had signed an agreement that left key questions
unanswered: What, precisely, had happened to torpedo Volkswagen's
seemingly exclusive acquisition of both names? And what would it
mean for the future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and its clientele?
</P>
<P>
   Far from Bavaria, in Aylesbury to the west of London, Michael
Shrimpton felt he already knew. ``It's a disaster; it will kill off
both marques,'' huffed the 41-year-old lawyer and Bentley owner who
had spearheaded an unsuccessful attempt earlier this year to raise
enough money from Rolls-Royce and Bentley owners to keep both names
in British managerial hands.
</P>
<P>
   The final deal between the two German companies left a lot of
ambiguity. The ``memorandum of understanding'' signed at the
Neuburg country club meant that Volkswagen had paid the full price
of $790 million for only half the company, yet would secure both
the venerable Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, and its 2,400
skilled workers. BMW, by contrast, pledged a relatively small
amount _ some $65 million _ for the Rolls-Royce name, but with no
factory and no work force: both of those have yet to be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   For both companies, the names were paramount. ``The trademark is
worth more than the assets,'' Shrimpton said. And, rather like a
divorced couple sharing custody of a child, the deal foresaw the
two German automakers pooling resources and technology to produce
the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph at Crewe, even after 2003.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the deal was dictated by several intertwined
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The engines from the V-12 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the V-8
Bentley Arnage are supplied by BMW; and the Rolls-Royce name was
owned not by Vickers, but by Rolls-Royce PLC, the maker of jet
engines that had split from the car maker when their shared concern
collapsed in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Rolls-Royce PLC had a separate deal dating to
1990 with BMW, which also owns the British-based automaker Rover,
to produce jet engines in Germany, and the two companies had a
strong working relationship. ``We had an understanding with BMW all
the way through,'' said Peter Barnes-Wallis, the Rolls-Royce PLC
spokesman. Indeed, Rolls-Royce PLC's support had been made clear on
March 30 when it publicly welcomed Vickers' acceptance of a $560
million bid from BMW for Rolls-Royce and Bentley, a sum later
trumped by Volkswagen's $710 million offer on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Piech, the Volkswagen chief, though, seemed to be on a roll. In
mid-January, he had suggested in a German magazine interview that
the brand names be split. Oddly enough, in the light of what
finally happened, BMW said at the time that splitting Rolls-Royce
from Bentley would resemble splitting the ``V'' from the ``W'' in
VW.
</P>
<P>
   From then on _ protected from board criticism by Schroder's
support _ money seemed no object.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was enough cash on the balance sheet. It was not a
problem,'' said Lothar Lubinetzki, an automotive analyst with
Enskilda Securities in London. Indeed, at Volkswagen's annual
meeting in Hanover on June 4, Piech told shareholders that the
company, even with its conservative accounting procedures, had made
record after-tax profits of some $800 million. (Volkswagen also
announced in June that it would acquire Lamborghini SpA, the
Italian manufacturer of high-performance sports cars, through its
Audi unit.)
</P>
<P>
   Apart from outbidding BMW for Rolls-Royce, Piech used
Volkswagen's Audi unit to acquire Vickers' engine-building
subsidiary, Cosworth, for a further $194 million.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 3, Vickers and Volkswagen completed negotiations to
close their own deal, revaluing Rolls-Royce Motor Cars upwards by
some $80 million over the initial bid price of $710 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then, things began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   In what other participants depicted privately as two critical
miscalculations, Volkswagen had been gambling that neither BMW nor
Rolls-Royce PLC would play hardball. Piech had dismissed threats by
BMW to stop delivering supplies of engines, software and
air-conditioning to Rolls-Royce as ``sabre rattling.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, soon after the July 3 deal between Vickers and
Volkswagen, lawyers for Rolls-Royce PLC informed Volkswagen of the
1973 licensing agreement that gave Rolls-Royce PLC exclusive
control over the Rolls-Royce name in the event of a sale to a
foreign buyer. ``BMW knew they had our support in the arrangements
for the brand name,'' Barnes-Wallis said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   By July 9, BMW fulfilled its threat by giving a contractual
12-month notice on its engine supply deal, leaving Volkswagen only
one year to develop an entirely new engine for the Rolls-Royce
Silver Seraph and the Bentley Arnage. ``That was the key,'' said
Lubinetzki at Enskilda Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, BMW had been depicted as the loser in the bid
to enter the high-end luxury market. But now, BMW, backed by
Rolls-Royce PLC, held the keys to both the licensing and the engine
supply problems confronting Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   In parallel negotiations, BMW executives met with Volkswagen
managers while they also struck at a deal with Rolls-Royce PLC: BMW
would pay Rolls-Royce PLC $65 million for the Rolls-Royce name in a
redeemable loan note to be used as an investment by Rolls-Royce PLC
in the new Rolls-Royce company to be founded by BMW after January
1, 2003. Rolls-Royce PLC would also be given a seat on the board of
the new company, reinforcing its influence over the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Piech could have gone to court to challenge Rolls-Royce PLC over
the name. And BMW could have gone through with the cancellation of
the engine and components supply contract.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the two German automakers risked forcing the closure
of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars plant in Crewe as Volkswagen
struggled to develop a new engine _ a move that would have severely
harmed Volkswagen's already overpriced investment, not to mention
the very names that were so central to the negotiations. ``The
danger was that production could be terminated for a year or a year
and a half,'' Lubinetzki said. ``Volkswagen couldn't afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   Damage was already being inflicted. Potential Rolls-Royce and
Bentley buyers were shying away from committing themselves.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' dealers reported a 30 percent drop in
confirmed orders. (Rolls-Royce and Bentley together produce fewer
than 2,000 cars a year.)
</P>
<P>
   But the deal began to shape up. BMW promised to continue
supplying engines for the Silver Seraph and Arnage until Jan. 1,
2003, and even after that date for the Silver Seraph. BMW acquired
the Rolls-Royce license from Rolls-Royce PLC and gave it free to
Volkswagen until January 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides got less than they wanted, although Volkswagen seemed
to come off worse. Volkswagen's spokesmen in Wolfsburg, Germany,
declined to return a reporter's calls to discuss the deal this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The one player left out of the entire process was Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, whose chief executive, Graham Morris, a former Audi
executive, had promised his staff faithfully that, whatever
happened, the two names would not be split up. Two days after the
meeting in Bavaria, Morris quit to make way for a successor to be
appointed by Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts like Shrimpton, moreover, fear that the new
arrangement will radically alter the profile of the two British
marques. Volkswagen has made no secret of its plan to develop a
more modest Bentley, possibly based on a sports coupe prototype
Bentley unveiled in 1994. Production at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
could increase to 10,000 units a year _ most of them smaller
Bentleys, Richard Charlesworth, a company spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Rolls-Royce, moreover, could also have a
different character. After 2003, new models will no longer be built
at Crewe, according to the terms of the deal. Rolls-Royce has been
producing cars there since 1947, relying on a work force that has
generations of experience in such arcane matters as building walnut
dashes and hand-tooled leather seats.

A NEW ATTRACTION IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tourists flocked to the newest attraction in the
nation's capital Thursday, just a block away from the museums on
the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest spot in the city was the E. Barrett Prettyman
Federal Courthouse, where Monica S. Lewinsky testified for the
first time to a grand jury about her alleged relationship with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People called it ``Monica Beach'' for the hordes of reporters,
photographers and television crews sitting in folding chairs _ some
under umbrellas to shade the sun _ waiting to chronicle the comings
and goings at the courthouse. The nickname is a variation on
``Barry Beach'' as the courthouse entrance was known during
Washington Mayor Marion Barry's 1990 drug trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the tourists hoped for an up-close look at the former
White House intern now known almost universally by her first name.
They saw her for a moment when she entered the building _ and 8 1/2
hours later when she left _ dressed in a navy blue suit with white
shoes and purse.
</P>
<P>
   But the real show most of the day was the massed media, encamped
along the perimeter of the building. Tourists looked on in awe at
the reporters and photographers on hand to cover the Lewinsky
story. And the reporters there to do stories about all the
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the tourists and media coexisted peacefully.
But in one case, a spectator got too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   George Hancock, 32, a student at Kentucky State University in
Bowling Green, Ky., earned threats from cameramen when he walked in
front of the cameras as Lewinsky was entering the courthouse about
8:30 a.m. He was holding a yellow posterboard sign that read ``We
support you, Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Phyllis Hancock, watched as a camerman jumped at her
son to push him out of the way of the cameras. Other cameramen
shouted curses at the scared man, who still clutched his sign and
raised it. ``I just wanted Monica to see my sign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phyllis Hancock dropped her yellow sign, which read
``Monica tells truth, Slick Willie must.'' ``We just came down here
thinking we'd have a few posters to show our support, but my son
almost got himself killed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the scuffle, reporters surrounded George Hancock, who gave
interviews for nearly an hour. ``I just want Monica to know that
someone in America supports her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, please don't give any more interviews!'' Phyllis
Hancock pleaded, but her son continued to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Another attention-grabber was Lilie Smith, who said she was
disabled and homeless. She sat in a wheelchair and held a sign that
referred to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as ``a vile stain in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can lie to America, and he can lie to the press,'' she
said. ``But he's on his way down.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking with as many reporters as she could, she stood up
and pushed her wheelchair down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Cook, 40, of St. Augustine, Fla., drew responses from the
crowd with his sign that read, ``It is not the stain on our
dress...It's the stain on our country...stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You speak for all of us, man,'' a spectator told Cook after
having his picture taken with him.

WITH HOUSE GOP AID, CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL PASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bloc of breakaway Republicans thwarted Speaker
Newt Gingrich Thursday in his last-ditch effort to kill a proposed
overhaul of the campaign finance system. The House then passed the
landmark plan and sent it to a reluctant Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 Republicans defying Gingrich and joining the Democratic
minority, the House passed the measure, 252-179, ending one of the
more spirited and successful efforts to defy House leaders in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   That vote was taken after the defeat of the plan's final
roadblock, an alternative bill, backed by Gingrich, 222-147.
Sixty-one legislators voted present.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has pledged to sign the plan into law,
said its passage, ``in defiance of the Republican leadership, is a
rebuke to the cynical view that political reform can never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The milestone emboldened supporters, who vowed to triumph over
similar opposition in the Senate, where GOP leaders have killed the
plan twice in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a golden opportunity,'' said Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, who engineered the victory with
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who has endured Gingrich's ire for his renegade effort,
said he put his arm around the speaker after the bill's passage to
thank him and his leadership team for keeping their word to permit
a final vote on the measure before the House began its summer
recess last night. ``I know it was not an easy thing for them to
see this process work out the way it did,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Shays organized a group of moderate Republicans in April. They
joined Democrats in petitioning the speaker, and forcing him to
allow a debate on the overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition then withstood several months of political
pressure, procedural roadblocks, and ``poison pill'' amendments
orchestrated by GOP leaders in a futile attempt to scuttle the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gingrich said the speaker had no immediate
comment on the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul plan would ban unlimited, unregulated
``soft-money'' contributions, which were at the center of most
fund-raising abuses in the 1996 elections. It also would require
special-interest groups that broadcast ads within 60 days of an
election to disclose who contributes to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous groups, including the Christian Coalition and American
Civil Liberties Union, have said they will challenge both
provisions in court as violations of free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   To the measure's supporters, the final passage marked ``an
extraordinary victory for the bill that would not die,'' said Ann
McBride, president of Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said it was crucial to send the bill to the Senate
before it returns in September for the final month of the
legislative session. Until then, a coalition of interest groups,
led by Common Cause, plans to wage a grass-roots campaign aimed at
reversing the Senate setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, 52 members of the 100-member Senate endorsed the
overhaul plan, only to see it die when supporters were unable to
muster the 60 votes needed to defeat Republican-led filibusters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said it ``would be a
waste of time'' for backers to try again this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats vowed to try to match the Shays-Meehan
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough road because of the filibuster
resistance,'' Senator John F. Kerry said. ``But I intend to use
every parliamentary opportunity I have to make sure we have that
debate and vote in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the obstacles the House coalition overcame was a
rare procedure that called for 12 alternative measures to be
considered, with the one receiving the most votes prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan plan received 237 votes on Monday, but it would
have died Thursday if the final alternative received more support.
</P>
<P>
   The last alternative plan, sponsored by Representatives Tom
Allen, a Maine Democrat, and Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas
Republican, would have banned ``soft money'' contributions only to
national parties, permitting its continued flow to state parties.
The measure fell 91 votes short of defeating the Shays-Meehan
proposal.

 WORLDCOM SELLS RECORD $6.1 BILLION IN BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Worldcom Inc. sold a record $6.1 billion of bonds
Thursday, attracting good demand in an otherwise choppy and worried
corporate bond market. The money will help pay for Worldcom's
acquisition of the MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The sale brought the total of corporate bond issuance for the
year to more than $560 billion, according to Securities Data Co.,
meaning that last year's record sales of $569.4 billion should be
shattered before the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers were eager enough to get Worldcom to raise the size of
its issue from the $5 billion expected as the final pricing took
place. The total sale easily outstripped the previous record for an
investment grade corporate bond, the $4.3 billion sale by the
Norfolk Southern Corp. in May of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldcom sale came on a day when the government bond market
was little changed, with the price of the 30-year bond down 1/32,
to 106 16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, was unchanged at 5.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, investors will get the July employment report, which
usually has the power to move markets. July's data, however, may be
much more difficult than ususal for traders to interpret because of
the distortions caused by the United Automobile Workers strike
against General Motors, which was settled last week.
</P>
<P>
   What made the Worldcom bonds attractive were the name, the
industry _ telecommunications _ and the prospect that Worldcom's
credit rating will be increased to the single A level in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was also helped by the fact that Worldcom's current
rating of BBB plus had just recently been raised two steps by
Standard &AMP; Poor's from BBB-, the bottom rung on the investment
grade ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Coley, the head of the capital markets and syndicate
group at the lead underwriter, Salomon Smith Barney, said that he
thought the success of the sale might help turn around the
corporate bond market, which has been spooked by the recent plunge
in the stock market and many of the same fears worrying stock
investors, including the economic crisis in Asia and the financial
turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks a shift in market psychology and may well give the
corporate bond market a needed boost,'' Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   John Bender, portfolio manager of the $795 million Strong
Corporate Bond Fund, bought some of the three-year and seven-year
notes and 30-year bonds from the issue. Because of the recent
turbulence in the market, he said ``we got it at a discount to what
we would have paid two or three months ago in a better
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale was in four maturities: $1.5 billion of three-year
notes with a 6.125 percent coupon priced to yield 6.163 percent, or
70 basis points over the comparable Treasury maturity; $600 million
in five-year notes with a coupon of 6.25 percent priced to yield
6.255 percent, 83 basis points over Treasuries; $2.25 billion of
seven-year notes with a coupon of 6.40 percent priced to yield
6.436 percent, 94 basis points over Treasuries, and $1.75 billion
of 30-year bonds with a coupon of 6.95 percent priced to yield
7.025 percent, 135 basis points over Treasuries. (A basis point is
one-hundredth of a percentage point.)

CALM RETURNS TO WALL STREET AS HARD-HIT SECTORS LEAD MARKET
HIGHER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While no one can say yet if the recent stock plunge
is over, a little calm returned to Wall Street on Thursday as some
of the worst hit sectors helped lead the market higher.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies stocks, which had plunged almost 14 percent to
a 1998 low in the last three weeks, rebounded, with the Russell
2000 index up 7.93 points, or 2 percent, to 406.62. Technology
stocks also rose, with Microsoft and Intel leading the Nasdaq index
up 41.31 points, or 2.31 percent, to 1,829.51. The index had fallen
11.3 percent since its recent high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more and more value out there,'' said Timothy
Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp., who said
he was buying stocks Thursday and Wednesday. Such picking among the
rubble will be needed to turn the market around.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghriskey was not buying the big, well-known stocks that have
been popular this year, saying that such stocks were still
overpriced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had driven up the prices of these large capitalization
stocks earlier in the year based on an earnings outlook that in
retrospect was too optimistic, in part because of the drag from
Asia. As a result, stock prices may have to slip some more before
they are more in line with diminished expectations for corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ghriskey said, ``Some stability in the market will bring
out the people who like to buy on the dips.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the signs of stability Thursday was the relatively narrow
range of trading in the major stock gauges. On Tuesday, the Dow
Jones industrial average swung almost 370 points from its high to
low and finished with a 163-point plunge in the last half hour. On
Wednesday, the trading range was 213 points, with the day ending
with a 184 point surge.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as the Dow rose 30.90 points, or 0.4 percent, to
8,577.68, the day's point swing was just 107 points and there was
no big reversal at the end of the day. The broader Standard &AMP;
Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 8.20 points, or 0.8 percent, to
1,089.63.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 fell more than 10 percent from
their July record highs during trading on Wednesday. But they
managed to finish the day down just under 10 percent, which is the
level that many analysts say means the market has suffered a
correction. The last such correction came last October, when a
554-point plunge in the Dow pulled the measure down 13.3 percent
from its August 1997 high.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive sign Thursday was the reversal of the
performance of advancing stocks versus those declining, with 1,699
stocks rising and 1,280 falling.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, even though the Dow ended the day higher, the
number of falling stocks on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered
the advancers 1,841 to 1,270. One Tuesday the rout was even worse,
with 2,626 stocks falling and only 514 rising. Trading volume
topped 768 million, above average but below the over 800 million
days Tuesday and Wednesday that are now the second and third
biggest volume days ever.
</P>
<P>
   Given the volatility of trading this week, Thursday's release of
the July employment report could be unsettling to the market. But
the data may be hard to interpret because of the distortions caused
by the strikes against General Motors, which were just settled last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first look at the strength of the economy in
the third quarter, and stronger-than-expected job growth might ease
some concerns about earnings shortfalls. On the other hand, weaker
growth can help allay fears that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates to slow growth and contain inflationary pressures.
Last month, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan,
warned that if the economy did not slow, the Fed might have to
raise interest rates, setting off the market's recent slump.
</P>
<P>
   The range of forecasts for non-farm payroll jobs in July runs
from a decline of 50,000 to an increase of 100,000, well below the
recent averages. But figuring out how much of that slowing of
growth is because of the GM strikes and how much is from the
economy continuing to slow could be difficult, leaving the outlook
for the economy less clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people will just dismiss the numbers,'' said
Ghriskey.

HOUSE KILLS ANTI-GAY MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a heated debate on gay rights and affirmative
action Wednesday, the House soundly rebuffed a measure intended to
reverse President Clinton's executive order banning discrimination
against gays and lesbians employed by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The 252-to-176 vote marked a major victory for pro-gay forces.
The amendment by Colorado Republican Joel Hefley was the highest
profile gay issue to come before Congress this term, with the
exception of the stalled nomination of James Hormel as ambassador
to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely jubilant,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay lobby. ``For
the first time in the history of this country, the U.S. House of
Representatives voted that discrimination against gay and lesbian
Americans is wrong, and we're proud of Democrats and Republicans
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hefley amendment was a top priority of religious and social
conservatives, who recently opened a broad campaign against legal
and political advances by gays.
</P>
<P>
   Both gay and anti-gay lobbying groups brought all their
firepower to bear on the Hefley amendment. Birch attributed the
victory to polls showing overwhelming support for Clinton's
executive order. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls last week
showed 72 percent of those polled were in favor of banning
discrimination against gays.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides framed the issue as a debate over whether the
executive order amounted to special rights or equal rights for gays
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   That question is pivotal on political as well as legal grounds:
Polls consistently show that the public strongly opposes
discrimination against homosexuals but also opposes granting them
``special rights'' or job preferences.
</P>
<P>
   California Republican Tom Campbell called it ``deeply hurtful''
to those who oppose affirmative action ``to hear the argument that
to ban discrimination necessarily leads to affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Dana Rohrabacher, added that
Clinton's order ``simply states that the federal government will
not consider sexual orientation in making hiring, firing and
promotion decisions.'' Affirmative action is ``not what this is
about,'' Rohrabacher said. ``The government should never persecute
or promote homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley attached the provision to the annual spending bill for
the Commerce, Justice and State departments. He argued that
Clinton's executive order went further than banning discrimination,
warning that it would apply affirmative action remedies to gays,
including hiring quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does much more than address sex discrimination,'' Hefley
said. Clinton's order adds sexual orientation to President Nixon's
original 1969 executive order banning discrimination on the basis
of gender, race and other characteristics, Hefley said, arguing
that the affirmative action programs that sprang up in response to
Nixon's original directive will now apply to gays, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows this means quotas and set-asides,'' Hefley said.
``This is a flagrant misapplication of presidential power.''
</P>
<P>
   When he announced the executive order in May, Clinton stated
that it merely ensured uniform policy across the federal
government, which already bans hiring discrimination against gays
and lesbians. Clinton said his order ``does not and cannot create
any new enforcement rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley lost the support of more than 60 Republicans and won only
a handful of Democrats to the measure. Most Democrats, including a
large contingent of African Americans, described the issue as one
of simple civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a black woman who was forbidden from attending public
schools because of the color of my skin, I am especially troubled
to witness this divisive, unfair and un-American attack on the
civil rights of our fellow citizens and our constituents,'' said
Democrat Barbara Lee, who represents Oakland, Calif. ``And as a
Christian who was raised to believe in tolerance and respect and
justice, I am especially saddened to see animus and homophobia
cloaked in religious terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama Republican Bob Riley said the Clinton order ``grants
special rights and privileges based on sexual orientation.'' Riley,
joined by a number of other Republicans, argued that ``legitimate
civil rights'' are based on such immutable characteristics as
gender and race, while homosexuality is a behavioral choice that
does not merit discrimination protection.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who is gay, insisted that
Clinton's order does not give anyone a new right to sue or grants a
new ``protected class'' for affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said gay lobbyists' next priority is to kill an amendment
sponsored by Rep. Frank Riggs, a Republican from Northern
California, that narrowly passed the House last week. That
provision seeks to punish San Francisco for requiring groups
contracting with the city to provide health benefits for domestic
partners. The Riggs amendment was never approved by the Senate; its
survival would require acceptance by a House-Senate conference
committee, which is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs and Hefley amendments are part of high-profile battle
over gay rights. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who recently
compared homosexuality to kleptomania and alcoholism in an
interview, has refused to schedule a vote on Hormel's ambassadorial
nomination. Then last month, conservatives started to take out
full-page ads that suggested gays could be ``reformed'' through
faith in God and prayer.

VICIOUS ANTS INVADE CALIFORNIA ORCHARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ A viciously stinging insect called the red
imported fire ant has invaded almond orchards in Kern and Fresno
counties, and state officials have quarantined the invaded areas as
they mount a campaign to wipe out the pests before they can spread
further.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-one colonies of the insects were recently discovered in a
Fresno County almond orchard near the town of Kerman, and 16
colonies were found last October near Lost Hills in Kern County,
according to Aurelio Posadas, a biologist and manager of the
eradication project with the State Department of Food and
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The ants are a particularly invasive species known
scientifically as Solenopsis invicta, and they apparently reached
California as hitch-hikers inside beehives shipped by a Texas
beekeeper, according to James Brazzle, the University of
California's entomology farm adviser for the Kern County
cooperative extension service. The Texas bees are used by almond
growers to pollinate the blossoms on their trees.
</P>
<P>
   Posadas and Brazzle said Wednesday they have worked out an
eradication campaign that will survey all potential invasion sites
and employ a chemical bait to attract the ants in the earthen
mounds they build, then apply a powerful but ecologically sound
insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move fast and attack them with a sledgehammer
before they become solidly established,'' Brazzle said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the invaded areas have now been quarantined so that state
officials and orchard managers can prevent the ants from spreading.
Officials will examine all produce, farm equipment and other
materials moving in and out of the quarantine zones, according to
Allen Clark of the Food and Agriculture department.
</P>
<P>
   The red fire ants are uniquely capable of stinging repeatedly,
and their venom is extremely powerful, Brazzle said. Their stings
have been known to kill calves and other small animals, and they
also feed on many plant species.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than a nuisance to humans because they respond
``rapidly and aggressively'' whenever they are disturbed, Brazzle
said. ``And when you stumble across one, it's a particularly
painful experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another related species, the Southern fire ant Solenopsis
xyloni, has long been established in California, and it is
extremely difficult to tell one of the ants from another, Brazzle
said. Working together, farmers and state agriculture officials
have battled the established ant species continually for many
years.

PANEL'S GOP MEMBERS CENSURE RENO IN FUNDRAISING PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee, led by Republicans determined to
put pressure on Janet Reno and embarrass the Clinton
administration, Thursday voted to hold the Attorney General in
contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over Justice Department
memos recommending she name an independent counsel to probe alleged
Democratic campaign-fundraising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   After a long and rancorous public hearing, all Republicans on
the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight voted to cite Reno
for contempt for refusing the panel's subpoena for the documents.
All committee Democrats, plus Independent Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, opposed the extraordinary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reacted quickly, saying she regretted the committee action,
which she called a ``form of political tampering that no prosecutor
in America could accept.'' But she said she would not be cowed into
naming an independent counsel or turning over to Congress sensitive
prosecution memos that could damage the Justice Department's
ongoing probe of 1996 fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply have to draw the line for what I believe to be an
important principle: Prosecutions in America must be free of
political influence,'' Reno said at a Justice Department press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The House has never held a Cabinet officer in contempt of
Congress, and most lawmakers doubt that Thursday's recommendation
will reach the full House for a vote. Reno says she will review and
act on the memos in question within the next three weeks and then
discuss at least some of their contents with committee chairmen
before Congress returns in September from its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House has no enforcement powers, the Justice
Department says a contempt citation would be handled by Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder. He would have to decide whether to
appoint an independent counsel to prosecute a criminal case against
Reno. Criminal penalties range up to a $10,000 fine and a year in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members understand that what happened today was political
grandstanding, an empty exercise that is going absolutely
nowhere,'' said Representative John Tierney, a Massachusetts
Democrat who is a member of the government reform committee.
``Chairman (Dan) Burton's efforts to make Reno look bad instead
made her look like somebody who can stand up to a bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Burton said he, too, regretted citing Reno for
contempt, but he insisted it was necessary for his oversight
committee to find out why Reno was ignoring the recommendations of
her own deputies and whether she was doing so as a political agent
protecting the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped the attorney general would work with us in good
faith to try to resolve this impasse, but she hasn't,'' Burton said
as Thursday's hearing opened. ``The American people have a right to
know what is happening. If we believe that the attorney general is
not following the law, than we have a reponsibility to find out
why.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Burton is seeking confidential memos written for
Reno by FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella, the former
head of the Justice Department's campaign-fundraising task force.
Freeh delivered his memo nine months ago; LaBella finished his last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and LaBella have acknowledged that their memos say the
attorney general has no choice but to name an independent counsel
to investigate top Clinton administration officials in connection
with possible campaign-fundraising crimes _ a move Reno has
resisted for close to a year. But in testimony to Burton's
committee Tuesday, the men opposed giving the prosecution memos to
Congress, arguing it could thwart the ongoing Justice investigation
and violate grand jury privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says Reno is stonewalling to shield the White House from
an independent investigation, and he accused her of
``orchestrating'' a political campaign to avoid his subpoenas and
dodge a contempt citation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno insisted Thursday she had tried to accommodate the
chairman, but that he had ignored her telephone calls and rebuffed
her offer to testify and explain why she was resisting his
subpoenas. The attorney general says she will brief Burton, as well
as the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary
Committees _ Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Representative Henry
Hyde of Illinois _ as soon as she decides whether or not to name an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and ranking
member on the government reform committee, charged Burton with
wielding the contempt citation to intimidate Reno into naming an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every member of this committee should be offended and
embarrassed by this strong-arm tactic,'' Waxman said during the
hearing. ``This odious threat of contempt is below contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who has run
the campaign-fundraising investigaton in the Senate, said Burton
was justified in using all legal means to obtain documents the
Clinton administration has withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contempt is an unusual proceeding, but these are unusual
circumstances _ circumstances the attorney general and the Justice
Department have created,'' Thompson said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Congress has cited a member of executive branch
for contempt was in 1982, when Anne Gorsuch Burford, administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency, refused to turn over
subpoenaed documents to Congress. A compromise was later reached,
and the contempt citation was rescinded.

migrant workers. He and his wife, Angie, have been married nine
years and have moved 12 times. With two small children in tow, the
task becomes more difficult. He split time last season between
Malaga, Spain, and the Continental Basketball Association. He has
played for four European teams and eight NBA clubs, making his tour
of duty with the Rockets in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pack 'em up, and take the whole show on the road,'' Wood said.
``We look at it like God sends us to different places all over the
world. We laugh and view ourselves as well-paid missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the gypsy life of pro basketball outside the bright
spotlight of multimillion-dollar contracts and lucrative
endorsement deals, where the players union is rattling swords and
threatening to wipe out the start of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   They are Oliver, Wood, Ashraf Amaya, Wendell Alexis, Michael
Hawkins and the rest, the major part of the U.S. team that is alive
for the gold medal and battling the odds in the World Championship
of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   They are players like Oliver, who had a taste of NBA life _ at
Cleveland in 1990-91 and Boston in 1993-94 _ or Wood, who has
logged 412 games in the NBA. Or they are like Alexis, 34, who has
only sniffed the big time, cut from Golden State's training camp in
1986, and is finding his way in these strange and foreign places.
</P>
<P>
   It is a life where you must deal with different cultures and
strange languages and eventually, after so many years slip by, come
to grips with the reality that if you want to play pro basketball,
this is your place. Really, your only choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to accept at times,'' Oliver said. ``Sure. I have
people at home asking me why I don't call up the Cavaliers and ask
them to give me another chance. Hey, I've been living up the road
from them in Akron ever since I got out of school. I think the
Cavaliers know where I am. But I'm not going to beg anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, the feisty point guard, is content playing for
Olympiakos of Athens. He spent two months with Boston in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.L. Carr gave me a chance to experience the NBA, and I'm
grateful for that,'' he said. ``But I'm also realistic. Maybe it's
an ego thing to try to get back for some guys. But I'm comfortable
that people on both sides of the Atlantic know who Michael Hawkins
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he had given up hope of making it back to the NBA
before this experience. He had spent 50 days in the CBA last
season, led his team in rebounds and didn't get a call up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much resigned to it,'' Wood said. ``But this has
brought back the spark. I'm thinking there is a reason this all
happened with the lockout and the NBA not being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the scouts are here. You look in the stands, and
there's Jerry West. That's Rudy Tomjanovich coaching us. It's a
chance to be seen. A chance to get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are younger players like Jason Sasser, 24, and Gerard
King, 25, who believe that chance is coming, though their talent
might say otherwise. And there is Alexis, whose time to dream of
the NBA has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what I've done over here,'' he said. ``I have had
a good career. I've been able to support myself playing basketball.
More than anything, I think I've persevered. It would have been
easy when I didn't make it in the NBA to quit, to turn in another
direction and get a different job. But I stayed with it. I came
here to Europe, and I found my place.''
</P>
<P>
   A different place, a strange place, but their place. A home away
from home where ``I love this game'' has to be not just an ad
slogan but a way of life.

A'S REGAIN THEIR SANITY 
BY DAVID BUSH
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    OAKLAND, Calif. _ The A's didn't exactly get even with the
Yankees on Wednesday night. But their 3-1 victory behind Tom
Candiotti's complete-game masterpiece at the Coliseum erased much
of the gloom the New Yorkers had inflicted on the Oakland clubhouse
the previous two days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Candiotti, the 13-year veteran, was signed over the winter to
win games just like this, checking a losing streak before a feeling
of inferiority could become a teamwide condition. The baseball term
for that is stopper, and Candiotti (7-13) stopped a lot Wednesday
night, including the high-octane Yankees offense. He held New York
to four hits. which, truth be told, is twice as many as the A's got
off Hideki Irabu (10-5), himself the author of a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional game for us,'' said Candiotti, who was as
energized as he has been this year, pumping his fist after
successes in the game's decisive moments. ``Not only are the
Yankees a good team, but they're hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who were 7-1 against the A's this year after losing
the season's first matchup, had bullied the A's through three
straight games this week, including that galling doubleheader sweep
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory not only salvaged the final game of the series
but wrapped up the homestand for a respectable 5-5. ``We did it
against the three best teams in the American League (Boston,
Cleveland and New York),'' said Candiotti. ``And I know we got
ourselves some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez had given the Yankees a 1-0 lead when he belted
his 18th homer of the year in the fifth inning. But Candiotti was
steadfast, dodging a first-and-third, nobody-out situation in the
seventh, and ultimately striking out Tuesday night's villain,
Darryl Strawberry, to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The A's took the lead in the bottom of the fifth with a two-run
rally built around one hit, an RBI single by Rafael Bournigal. The
A's other hit was Rickey Henderson's two-out homer in the eighth,
breaking his 0-for-21 skid.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague got the A's fifth inning started by literally taking
one for the team. He undoubtedly would have preferred a more
dignified way to reach base, but when Irabu's pitch nailed him in
the left arm, he trotted to first.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Blowers worked Irabu for a walk, and A's manager Art Howe,
aware how precious runs would be, ordered Miguel Tejada to
sacrifice, which he did. Bournigal dropped a soft single into right
field. Sprague scored on that hit, and Blowers moved to third. He
was in position to score when A.J. Hinch lifted a sacrifice fly to
right field to put the A's up 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees appeared ready to take care of both that lead and
Candiotti when Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams singled to open the
seventh. But Candiotti, feeding the Yankees a steady diet of his
knuckleballs, struck out Martinez, and after walking Strawberry,
retired the next two hitters on flyballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mixed it up tonight. He was able to take speed off the
knuckler and add speed to it,'' A's catcher Hinch said. ``He even
threw a sidearm knuckleball. He was real creative.''
</P>
<P>
   And after he escaped the seventh. Candiotti was determined to
finish the job. He scooted through the eighth, but with two out in
the ninth, he walked Martinez to bring up Strawberry, author of the
game-turning grand slam Tuesday night. He never had a chance,
offering three futile swings at knucklers, each one slower than the
one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl didn't look comfortable with the knuckleball all
night,'' said Candiotti. ``So I just tried to see how slow I could
throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Candiotti's sixth strikeout of the night, and certainly
the most satisfying.  &UR; (For use by clients of the New &LR;

 &HT;    Georgia's recruits hit campus
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's 1998 football season officially kicks
off today when the Bulldogs' highly regarded freshman class reports
to campus.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Donnan is expected to welcome 22 scholarship freshmen
to Athens, including Parkview High offensive lineman Jon Stinchcomb
and Jeff Davis High quarterback Nate Hybl, both of whom enrolled at
Georgia for spring quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan says that as many as six freshmen could play this season,
including former Parade All-America quarterback Quincy Carter of
Decatur, who signed with Georgia Tech in 1996 before signing a
minor-league baseball contract with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Carter, who won't count against the Bulldogs' limit of 79
scholarships because of his professional status in baseball, and
Hybl are expected to contend for the starting quarterback job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington County High quarterback Terrence Edwards,
the younger brother of former Bulldogs running back Robert Edwards,
said Thursday that he will report to Georgia today. Edwards, a
6-foot-2, 175-pound Class AA all-state selection, says he still
hasn't been cleared by the NCAA Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said a core course taken at Washington County High is
being questioned. He said he could be admitted as a partial
qualifier if he isn't cleared by the Clearinghouse, meaning that he
could practice at Georgia this fall but couldn't play in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming to Georgia unless they tell me otherwise,'' Edwards
said from his Tennille home.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs already have lost three members of their recruiting
class to academic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Miller County High linebacker Charles Grant, regarded by some
recruiters as the state's top overall prospect last year, will
enroll at Hargrave (Va.) Military Academy on Monday, according to
Miller County coach Ronnie McNease.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a 6-foot-4, 225-pounder from Colquitt, did not graduate
from Miller County High, so he will have a chance to improve both
his grade-point average and his SAT score at Hargrave. If Grant
qualifies at prep school, he still would have four years of
eligibility remaining at a Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother didn't particularly like it, but I thought it was
best (for him not to graduate),'' McNease said. ``That way, he can
improve his GPA and SAT while he's up there. Right now, I'd have to
say he'll definitely re-sign with Georgia, talking to him and
talking to the people up there. But things could change six months
from now. But I know Georgia's still talking to him, and he still
wants to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington County linebacker Jessie Miller and Peach County
quarterback Regan Torbert are expected to enroll at Georgia in
January. Miller, who had a qualifying SAT score negated by the
Clearinghouse, underwent shoulder surgery last month.
</P>
<P>
   Peach County High coach Rodney Walker said Torbert could have
been admitted to Georgia as a partial qualifier, but instead,
Torbert will sit out this fall and retake the ACT. Walker said
Torbert was only one point short of gaining the required score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be admitted as a partial qualifier, but there's no
reason to lose that entire season,'' Walker said. ``He wasn't going
to play this fall anyway.''

 &HT;    Bush has to prove himself all over
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Devin Bush was walking away from an interview on
Thursday when he said it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is big for me,'' Bush said while boarding a bus that
would transport the Atlanta Falcons to the Georgia Dome for a
practice session. ``I gotta get on some film. Gotta get some PT'' _
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the thoughts of many Atlanta players as they prepare
to face the Tennessee Oilers at 7:30 p.m. today in the Georgia Dome
in the first of four preseason games. Eighty players are fighting
for 53 roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a fourth-year safety, is in a tough spot. He started at
free safety last season and had the best year of his career _ 105
tackles and 10 passes defensed, despite being switched from strong
safety before the season.
</P>
<P>
   His reward has been a move back to strong safety, where he is
playing behind 10-year veteran William White. The 5-foot-11,
210-pound Bush has played well in the first two-plus weeks of
training camp and appears to be gaining ground. But he must play
well in preseason games, and he knows it. It's possible that the
loser of the battle between Bush and White would be gone before the
regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to play nearly two quarters tonight and is one
of several veterans in highly scrutinized battles for roster spots
and starting jobs. Former Rams teammates Todd Kinchen, who played
in Atlanta last season, and Keith Crawford are trying to win the
third receiver spot. Weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett is out
to show that his age _ he'll be 33 in two weeks _ and 35 days in
jail in the offseason have not slowed him. And Robbie Tobeck wants
to prove that his switch from left guard to center _ something he
asked for _ is a good move.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's situation is different. He played exceptionally well
as the Falcons closed the season with a 6-2 run, and his latest
move was not expected. When the Falcons signed 13-year veteran
Eugene Robinson on March 6, Robinson was given the free-safety job.
Bush was left to battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my highest career totals, ... and that (change) hit
hard,'' he said. ``It was like, `Bam! We signed Eugene and you're
out.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to (coach Dan Reeves and secondary coach Ron Meeks) and
asked, `What's my role around here?' and they said, `We're going to
let you play behind Eugene Robinson (at free safety).' I said,
`Why? You've told me teams are calling about trading for me; why
don't you just go ahead and trade me so I can go and try to start
somewhere else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who left Florida State a year early to become the Falcons'
first-round draft choice in 1995, eventually simmered down, and the
Falcons changed their minds _ moving him to backup strong safety,
at least the fourth switch of positions for Bush in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to find the best mix for your team,'' Meeks said.
``Bringing Eugene in brings stability to the secondary. With Devin,
we felt in the long run he would be better as a strong safety. He's
a physical guy who has a knack for wanting to be in contact.''
</P>
<P>
   That fits the typical description of a strong safety, who
generally is expected to play more of a run-support role than a
free safety does. Actually, Bush's numbers in the second half of
the season were a lot more like those of a strong safety. In the
first eight games, he had 37 tackles. In the last eight games, he
had 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half I was trying to learn how (an almost totally
revamped coaching staff) wanted me to play,'' he said. ``Then, they
were coming to me and saying, `We're not getting a lot of
production out of you.' They wanted interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a problem. Bush had no interceptions and just three
passes defensed in the first half of the season. In his first two
seasons, he had a total of two interceptions and three passes
defensed. A free safety needs to be around the ball more, not so
much when it's in the hands of running backs but when it's in the
air _ a center fielder of sorts, like Robinson, the NFL's leading
active interceptor with 49.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush made a turnaround. He tackled, including games of eight
twice, nine, 11 and 12. And he intercepted a pass against New
Orleans and defensed seven passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told myself I'm going to go back to playing the way I
know I can play,'' he said. ``I just wanted to play hard, with a
lot of intensity, just be myself. Guys were giving me feedback,
saying, `Man, you're playing at a different level.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush's contract, which included a signing bonus of $1.08 million
and will pay him a base salary this year of $664,800 (to White's
$350,000), ends after this season. Even if he makes the roster,
he's not sure he'll be back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not up to me,'' he said. ``That's up to the team. They
may not want me.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcon officials are not willing to say much about Bush's future
with the team. The Jets, Bears and Cardinals are among teams that
have shown an interest in acquiring him, and they will be among the
24 NFL teams with scouts at tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made up ground on White. He has a distinct edge in
speed and athletic ability, and he's trying to pick up some of the
savvy Robinson and White rely upon. He said he's just trying to get
back to where he was _ a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plus for us to have another veteran (in Robinson),
another guy I can learn from,'' he said. ``It's more competition,
but I welcome it. Our secondary will be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been a starter (in all 16 games last year and 36 of 43 as
a Falcon), and it's been kind of hard to swallow,'' he said. ``I've
had to sit back and play my role as a team player and do what I
have to do to be a better player. In this defense, the safety
positions are almost the same. I just want to be on the field. It
doesn't matter where, free or strong.''

 &HT;    Full moon or fluke of physiology?
 &HT;    By Lisa Ocker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ A youth baseball coach denies accusations
that he twice mooned a tournament crowd last weekend, explaining
that his waist-less physique causes his drawers to droop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my pants are constantly falling down. My wife calls it
a plumber's butt,'' said Paul Tamboe, one of the coaches for the
Palm Beach Baseball Academy team.
</P>
<P>
   Tamboe said he was picking up baseball gloves and caps thrown
down in frustration by his 9- and 10-year-old team members after
losing the semifinals game to the Boca Raton Patriots Sunday, Aug.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was picking up a lot of stuff. I might've bent over more
than once,'' he said. ``By the time I get back to the dugout, I'm
being accused of mooning the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton police are investigating the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Tamboe stopped near the pitching mound, yelled
something to the crowd, bent over and dropped his trousers, then
hoisted them and did it again near third plate, according to the
police report. Nineteen people saw a single mooning, while three
observed ``both exposures,'' police said.

Sand Park was marred by contested umpires' calls and, according to
Tamboe, racially derogatory remarks shouted by spectators at his
team.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's aftermath was worse: a Palm Beach coach accused a
Boca coach of shoving him during the post-game high-fives. And an
8-year-old Palm Beach player told police a Boca coach twisted his
arm rather than shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very vulgar, very malicious, very rude and
inconsiderate,'' Tamboe said. ``You might've thought it was an
international soccer game.''

 &HT;    Attorney accuses north Fulton pair of 'racketeering'
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The attorney for a man whose ex-wife kidnapped his
son charged in federal court Thursday that Faye and Howard Yager
profit from helping women and children disappear into an
underground network.
</P>
<P>
   The Yagers, said Carrollton attorney Gary Bunch, ``engage in
organized racketeering conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunch has filed an $80 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court on
behalf of Jeffrey Rubenstein, a Connecticut man who has been
looking for his son, Randy, since September.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Yager is the controversial operator of the Children of the
Underground, a network of safe houses that hides children, and
generally their mothers, from allegedly abusive fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Yager was tried, and acquitted, in 1992 in Cobb County on
kidnapping and child cruelty charges. She has also been sued
before. This is the first civil suit that named Howard Yager as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Yagers, who live in north Fulton, didn't appear in court
Tuesday. They were not subpoenaed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, which will continue today, was on a motion for a
temporary restraining order to stop the Yagers from continuing to
hide Randy Rubenstein and compel them to provide information on
where the boy can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence introduced Thursday included photographs of Bonnie and
Randy Rubenstein together with Faye Yager as she worked to get them
out of the country. The photos appeared in the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette last December in a series of stories that featured
Yager and her efforts to help women go underground. Several video
tapes of Faye Yager interviews were also introduced. Nick Souris of
Smyrna testified he rented an apartment near Paris to Faye Yager in
February. While in France later that month, he met a woman named
Liz and her son, David. Souris, when shown photos of Bonnie and
Randy Rubenstein, identified them as Liz and David. Bunch also
introduced evidence that Howard Yager was driving the Jeeps of
women who had gone underground. One of the cars was apparently
given to a friend of the Yagers, Jay Wilcox Davis, who repeatedly
invoked her rights against self-incrimination during questioning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that the Yagers profit from helping women ``is total
hogwash,'' said Robert Schroeder, attorney for Howard Yager.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch also introduced evidence he said shows Howard Yager bought
the airline tickets for women fleeing the country and accompanied
Faye Yager and the fugitives on flights to Europe.

RAIDERS' LINEBACKERS UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY 
BY RON KROICHICK
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names drift along the football landscape, at once familiar
and intriguing. The Raiders considered signing Bryan Cox. Then they
flirted with Greg Lloyd. Both times, they passed.
</P>
<P>
   So here they stand, on the brink of the exhibition season, still
flowing with youth and obscurity at linebacker. They will start
Greg Biekert, Mike Morton and James Folston in Thursday night's
scrimmage against the Dallas Cowboys in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the linebackers who have departed in recent seasons:
Winston Moss, Mike Jones, Rob Fredrickson. The Raiders historically
pour money into other positions on defense _ namely, linemen and
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   That often leaves Oakland with an unheralded group of
linebackers. Nothing is different this season, as the Raiders steam
through training camp with only Biekert (59 career starts) firmly
established in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Morton (17 starts) showed flashes of promise last season, before
he suffered a serious back injury November 16 in San Diego. Folston
(seven starts) begins this season as the biggest question mark of
all.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake: Defensive coordinator Willie Shaw needs his
linebackers to play well. Shaw's defense is predicated on pressure,
something the Raiders seldom applied in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``More is expected of the linebackers,'' Shaw said. ``They're
under the microscope a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw remains open to change. He acknowledged that the Raiders
were thin and inexperienced at linebacker. He said they would
continue to scan the free-agent market, right up until the season
opener on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shaw refuses to reach conclusions based on
last season. The Raiders had the worst defense in the league,
allowing more than 26 points and 382 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers were specific targets of blame. They missed
tackles, lagged in pass coverage and caused little havoc. Shaw
arrived eager to start anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running around a lot more than we did last year, that's
for sure,'' Folston said, smiling. ``It makes you feel great when
the offense doesn't know what the hell you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Biekert, the middle linebacker, offered no excuses for the
disaster of '97. He placed the linebackers in the same unflattering
light as the defensive line and the secondary _ the entire team,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at everything as a whole,'' Biekert said.
``Nobody did as well as they should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw suggested, the role of the linebackers will expand this
season. They must shed blocks and become reliable tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, they also must fly into the backfield. The
assignment rarely fell in Biekert's domain during his first five
years in the league; he's known as sturdy against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Shaw unveils his wide variety of zone blitzes, Biekert
finds himself in an absolutely foreign role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different for me,'' he said. ``In the past, most of
the blitzes came from the outside. Willie's schemes include a lot
of inside blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing it. If I can get in on a blitz, let's do it. I
want to be the one who's back there making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton is grateful he's healthy enough to make plays. He
suffered a herniated disk against the Chargers, leading to surgery
in December. Morton then endured a long, slow rehabilitation
process.
</P>
<P>
   Folston, who stepped into the lineup after Morton got hurt, sees
this season as his big opportunity. He's a former second-round
draft choice (1994) who has done little beyond special-teams play
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to solidify my starting place,'' Folston said. ``I'm
not knocking UPS or the Teamsters union, but I'd rather work in the
NFL.''

LANGHAM UPGRADES 49ERS 
BY GARY SWAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    STOCKTON _ How can a team with the best defense in the NFL last
season and a pass defense ranked No.2 hope to get any better when
it loses one of the best cornerbacks ever to play the position?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 49ers feel they improved now that Antonio Langham, one of
the best young veteran defensive backs in the NFL, has joined them
to replace Rod Woodson, who clearly had lost a step off his
legendary coverage skills last season.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson had a career-high 12 penalties _ twice as many as any
other player on the team _ called on him last season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, getting a healthy Marquez Pope back at the right
corner will help, too. Pope missed 11 games last season after badly
spraining his foot in the second game and was not back to preinjury
form when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   But bringing in the 26-year-old Langham to replace the
33-year-old Woodson is where the 49ers feel they have made a step
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost experience, but still you're looking at a guy who's
been a four-year starter,'' said defensive backs coach Jim Mora.
``He was a first-round draft choice (Browns, 1994) and played for a
national championship team at Alabama. He's got that winning
attitude. He's fit in well with our group.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci said there is no assurance Langham is going
to make the all-time NFL team, as Woodson did. But also Woodson
played hurt much of the time last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three interceptions in one game (September 14 vs. the
Saints) and didn't have an interception after that,'' Mariucci
said. ``He was oftentimes nursing a calf strain or a lower back or
there were some days when he couldn't practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham, who signed a five-year, $17 million contract, said he
likes the 49ers' defensive scheme because it calls for more
man-to-man coverage than he was used to with the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It exposes the corners a lot but it also gives them a chance
to do what they're supposed to do best,'' he said. ``It's a tough
life out there. You've got to have a one-play memory all the time.
It helps to have amnesia where you forget what you did on the last
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham does not have Deion Sanders speed, maybe not even
Tyronne Drakeford speed, and the lack-of-speed label has followed
him since the college combine workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his speed is,'' Mora said. ``All I know is
he's fast enough to cover these guys. I have not seen him get run
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham had three interceptions last season and he returned one
for a touchdown. He has 12 picks in his four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I learned from the time I started playing Pop
Warner football is that a great technician can make up for speed
and other stuff he may be missing,'' Langham said. ``A lot of time
when it's hot like this in a game, your legs start to give out on
you, I don't care how fast you are. You've got to be more of a
technician than an all-out flash speedstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he not fast, he's not big either.
</P>
<P>
   Covering J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens in practice gives Langham
a chance to work on his big-receiver coverage technique. He gives
away four inches and 40 pounds to Stokes; three inches and 30
pounds to Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good going against those guys because they give you
everything, including the pushing and shoving that's part of the
NFL now,'' Langham said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers defense typically takes a backseat to the offense, and
that is fine with Langham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of the defense as silent killers,'' he said.
``You don't have to have all the publicity going into a game. A
silent killer is worse than a noisy killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham has not been around this much talent since he was a
member of Alabama's 1993 national championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I see here reminds me of what we had at Alabama.
It scares me a little bit sometimes,'' Langham said. ``Everybody
was high on the offense but we were the ones pitching shutouts and
putting points on the board when they couldn't move the ball. It's
the same here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the defense steps on the field we say `Things might not
go good for the offense today. We got to figure out some way to put
points on the board down the stretch.'''

DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED 
BY C.W. NEVIUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do not attempt to resist. You are powerless to stop these
events, as much as you wish you could. They are as inevitable as
disaster movies in the summer and the crash of the Beanie Babies
market.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments on the sports horizon that are only distant
specks right now. But they are rocketing toward us at the speed of
a Randy Johnson heater.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Big Unit is a good example. We knew he was going to
leave Seattle, even though in a perfect world, he would not have
been traded. Now watch for the following:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIKE TYSON:  &LR; I think we all can agree that getting a boxing
license is a given. Somebody is going to give him one, in some
state. Guys who were legally blind have gotten boxing licenses,
guys who have criminal records stacked up higher than Don King's
hair have gotten boxing licenses, and 84-year-old George Foreman
has not only gotten a boxing license, but he is going to fight
73-year-old Larry Holmes. (I might not have their ages exactly
right, but those are pretty close.)
</P>
<P>
   The real capper is going to be a rematch with Evander Holyfield,
who seems like a nice-enough chap who is being sucked deeper into a
quagmire. Holyfield has to fight Tyson for the monumental payoff,
and the result not only will be a sham of a bout, but we also will
have to spend another month attempting to understand the inner Mike
Tyson, crying out for help.
</P>
<P>
   The real question: Where will they fight? It's just a guess, but
remember these three words _ Montana log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE YANKEES:  &LR; Well, of course they are headed for the World
Series, and that's just fine. The Yanks are a powerhouse team, just
like in the good old days. There's nothing wrong with that team, or
the way it plays.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will be the opening of the floodgates of latent
Yankees fans. There is no more unpleasant sound in sports than the
nasal honk of the latent Yankees fan who has just dusted off the
old blue NY cap and has begun wearing it everywhere. We didn't hear
a peep from them when they were struggling, but now ...
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the Series will bring out the Big Yank himself,
George Steinbrenner, who has been dying to explain his theory on
several important matters in America. This just in: George would
have settled the General Motors strike in three hours, four tops.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATRELL SPREWELL:  &LR; He is going to be moving to a new team soon,
you know. The trade will go through, and the Warriors will be
thrilled to acquire someone who both can back up Donyell Marshall
and grow eight inches and play center with a couple of seasons of
hard work. That's not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No, the real story will be that Sprewell will find his way to a
team that makes the playoffs, and once he gets to the postseason,
he will play great. He's sure to be on an absolute crusade by the
time the season starts. He will be in great shape, and he is too
talented and experienced not to rise to the occasion on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   By then, all the questions about choking P.J. Carlesimo will
have been asked and re-asked, Sprewell will throw in a visit to a
children's hospital, make a contribution to the Boys and Girls
Club, and the postseason stories will begin, ``Latrell Sprewell was
considered a problem player with the Warriors, but his new
teammates wonder if he wasn't getting a bad rap ... ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAKERS:  &LR; It has to be said. They are going to win the NBA
championship, if not this season, then soon afterward. Who is going
to beat them? The Jazz?
</P>
<P>
   If the Chicago Bulls are truly broken and disbanded, the Lakers
will win by default. And won't that be a wonderful thing? More Jack
Nicholson, more Dyan Cannon, and much, much more Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   No, there is nothing inherently wrong with Shaq. As tattooed
basketball players go, he is funnier and more talented than most.
He raps, he acts, he dunks. What more do you want?
</P>
<P>
   How about a game? When the Lakers win, we are going to have to
hear all about the wonderful-ness of Shaq, and how he is redefining
the game, when all he is really doing is knocking people over and
making layups.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with the kids, who declined to buy his signature
sneakers so forcefully that the shoes were discontinued. They never
saw him get more than three inches on the floor in them. Why would
they want a shoe that does that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE 49ERS:  &LR; Don't you feel it? This means getting in touch with
the darker you, the deep inner feelings that you don't want to
admit to having. The 49ers are going down.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, the vibes are not good. There is the whole messy
Louisiana grand jury investigation hanging over Eddie DeBartolo,
the march of Carmen Policy off the gangplank, Jerry Rice's knee,
Steve Young's cranium and the loss to the Packers that ended last
season.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to like peppy Steve Mariucci, but when you run down
the list of old favorites _ Merton Hanks, Tim McDonald, Ken Norton,
Harris Barton _ you're thinking, these guys are high-mileage. And
then you look at the future, and all you can see is the looming
figure of Jim Druckenmiller. Tell the truth: Didn't you get a chill
there, just for a second?
</P>
<P>
   If not, be patient. It's coming. They all are.

SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS IRAQ'S ACTIONS `TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IRAQ-U.S.)  
(lh) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council, in rare unanimity, closed
ranks Thursday to berate Iraq for ending cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors, but it took no action other than to demand that Baghdad
reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Iraq was isolated in the Security Council, the
government got mixed signals from Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
suggested that the Iraqis, ``desperate'' for some movement toward
ending sanctions, needed to be brought more closely into
deliberations here.
</P>
<P>
   Normal monitoring went on as usual Thursday in Baghdad, but no
intrusive searches were attempted since Iraq barred them on
Wednesday, UNSCOM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq decided this week that it would end cooperation with
arms inspections and allow only passive monitoring by surveillance
cameras, the Iraqis were aware that they were actually close to
meeting disarmament requirements in some areas, Richard Butler, the
chief arms inspector told the Security Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
said Thursday that the Iraqis also knew that problems in accounting
for biological and some chemical compounds were serious and
growing. Right up to the present, Iraq has continued to change
figures and alter other information earlier presented as ``full,
final and complete'' declarations.
</P>
<P>
   At times the Iraqis have been forced to revise a story when
confronted with evidence by inspectors _ as in the recent case of
the discovery of traces of VX nerve gas on shell casings. At other
times, they volunteer new information _ but that only raises more
troubling questions about why an account has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent examinations of old warhead remnants, for example,
weapons experts found more traces of anthrax than they could
explain. When the Iraqis were pressed, they revised earlier ``final
figures'' to say that they had actually filled three times as many
warheads with anthrax _ 16 _ as with botulism _ five. Until then,
Iraq said it had mounted weapons with more than three times more
botulism than anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   This admission has revived speculation among inspectors that
Iraq had produced not only more anthrax, but also two kinds of it,
one in a dry form that was easier to spray and had a longer shelf
life. Officials insist that this is only speculation at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Iraq changes the figures, it has a ripple effect
throughout their entire declaration,'' said Charles Duelfer, deputy
chairman of UNSCOM. ``That is a very complicated procedure because
a declaration is built and substantiated to support one set of
numbers, and to change that becomes very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and chief
negotiator on weapons issues, gave a new explanation of how VX
nerve gas could have been found on shells after Iraqis denied they
used it. In a letter to the Security Council on Wednesday, he said
the traces could have been created from the ``decomposition of
other chemical substances or from the use of equipment which had
already been used to produce the VX agent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Security Council members, united in shock
and a touch of weariness at having to work their way through
another unexpected crisis created by Baghdad, called Iraq's
decision to freeze cooperation with inspectors ``totally
unacceptable'' and then sat back to see what Saddam Hussein's next
move would be.

ORTIZ IS BIG NEWS IN WIN 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    NEW YORK _ The Giants hit into a triple play Wednesday night,
but that was hardly the biggest deal in a 6-4 victory over the New
York Mets. Six different Giants doubled as the Big Orange Machine
(83 runs in their past 12 games) kept humming, but that was not the
hottest news either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie Russ Ortiz, making his fourth start in place of injured
Shawn Estes, earned his first major-league victory, as he finally
got past his troublesome fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the greater scheme of things, that was the most significant
development for the Giants as they improved to 6-3 on this road
trip, which ends Thursday, and moved within 11/2 games of wild-card
leader Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz pitched into the ninth, netting six of his eight
strikeouts from the fifth inning on.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a leadoff double to Carlos Baerga in the ninth,
Giants manager Dusty Baker called for Robb Nen, who allowed Baerga
to score but finished the game for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   In going as far as he did, Ortiz afforded the rest of the
bullpen a desperately needed night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to see a young man like that get stronger as the game
wears on,'' Baker said. ``He was stronger in the sixth, seventh and
eighth innings. That's why I let him start the ninth. It looked
like he smelled the finish line. That's the sign of a guy who's
hungry, a guy who's determined and a guy who's in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Barry Bonds doubled home the two go-ahead runs for
his 80th and 81st RBIs, while Ellis Burks, J.T. Snow, Marvin
Benard, Rey Sanchez and Doug Mirabelli also doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Benard had two hits and is now 14-for-24 (.583) in his last six
games. Burks (3-for-5) has hit safely in every game as a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   But you want to hear about the triple play.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred in the fifth inning after Bonds doubled home Burks
and Bill Mueller to give the Giants a 4-3 lead, and Jeff Kent
followed with a line single to left.
</P>
<P>
   With nobody out, third-base coach Ron Wotus held Bonds at third,
a fateful decision with which Bonds disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I could have scored, but he stopped me,'' Bonds said.
``He saw something different than I did. I'm not looking at the
play. I'm looking at him. I think I should have gone. Even if he
makes a perfect throw, Kent still gets to second base and we've got
a guy in scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow came up and smashed a one-hopper to first baseman John
Olerud. As Olerud quickly threw to second to force Kent, Bonds
began dancing off third and bolted for home when shortstop Rey
Ordonez threw the ball back to first to double off Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud then fired the ball home, and though replays appeared to
show Bonds' leg sliding onto the plate ahead of catcher Todd
Pratt's tag, umpire Jim Quick raised his right hand emphatically.  &LR; 
 &LR;  The Giants had hit into their second triple play in two seasons.
Last May 10, Stan Javier hit into a bizarre one against the Cubs
involving a controversial infield-fly call.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won that game as well, but oddly enough, lost a game
this year in which they turned a triple play, at Wrigley Field on
May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Snow said he had never hit into a triple play before but was
involved in one defensively with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the ball,'' Snow said. ``I guess I have the honor
now of saying I hit into a triple play. I'm just lucky it didn't
come back to haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added two runs in the sixth to take a 6-3 lead and
give Ortiz some room to work.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two starts against the Reds and Phillies, Ortiz
pitched beautifully until the fifth inning, when the hitters
knocked him out with big fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Ron Perranoski spoke to Ortiz about mixing up his
pitches more and not firing fastball after fastball at hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of talked about feeding off what he's using and
changing speeds on his pitches rather than going full throttle on
all of them,'' Perranoski said. ``He's young. He's a little
concerned about hitters fouling off a lot of good pitches. When
that happens, it shows you're not getting your off-speed pitches
over enough for the hitters to be concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz did change speeds Wednesday night with great success and
got into trouble only because of wildness. All three of the runs he
allowed started with walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz understood the bullpen situation, and he was committed to
giving his mates a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to,'' he said. ``That's one of the things I thought
about going out there. I wanted to throw the least amount of
pitches and stretch it out, and not get the bullpen involved in the
middle of the game. That was a big thought on my mind.'' &QL;

 UNITED NATIONS: the situation.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Beijing, Moscow and Paris, the capitals most sympathetic to
Iraq, governments distanced themselves from Baghdad in statements.
In Russia and China, there were expressions of concern about the
consequences of continued Iraqi defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now extremely important not to stoke tensions over
Iraq,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told
a news briefing in Moscow. A Chinese spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said
his government would do what it could ``to avoid a worsening of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's lengthy Council meeting on the new Iraqi
crisis, a Western diplomat said that nobody relished having to take
strong action to make Iraq conform to its agreements. Until the
arms inspectors are satisfied that Iraq has provided answers to
outstanding questions about biological, chemical, nuclear and
missile programs, Saddam cannot hope to see the end of sanctions,
which were imposed in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was weary, everyone was annoyed and everyone was
concerned that this not turn into a crisis that would force the
United States to act as it had to act last year,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   The council action came after Butler briefed members on his
aborted trip to Iraq earlier this week. He also spoke on the Iraqi
leadership's refusal to turn over documents, including one
discovered in July that shed light on the amount of
``nonconventional munitions'' used during the 1980-87 war with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that the document could prove that there are
larger quantity of chemical _ and possibly biological _ agents
unaccounted for in Iraq than inspectors were told about last year.
Iraqis said that they had filled 101,080 warheads with chemical
weapons in the 1980s, but the new document reveals that fewer than
that were actually deployed. The inspectors want to now what
happened to the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also spoke to the council about his assessment of Iraq's
position after talking Thursday morning with Deputy Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz, who leads Iraqi negotiators in dealing with
UNSCOM. Annan told the Council that Iraq was ``clearly in violation
of the resolutions of the Security Council and the memorandum of
understanding I concluded in Baghdad in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is well understood by the government of Iraq,''
he said. Speaking to reporters later, Annan said that he had told
Aziz that Iraq could not dictate how inspections are conducted and
by whom.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had made clear to Aziz ``that the Iraqi
suggestion that UNSCOM should be restructured and possibly moved
from New York is something that was not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No individual state can tell the U.N. how to structure itself
to carry out tasks or mandates given to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan added that he thought Iraq's position was ``not a
closed one,'' that Baghdad had acted out of frustration and even
desperation, and that it might be the right time ``to stand back
and make a comprehensive reassessment of where we are, where are
going and how to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In undertaking this comprehensive review,'' he said, ``it
might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely than we
have hitherto done.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Iraq has persistently and successfully
managed to broaden its diplomatic contacts with U.N. officials,
skirting the Security Council when it can. Iraqis complain
repeatedly that the council and the disarmament commission are
dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Arab League Thursday, Aziz appealed for
support against what he called the ``injustice'' of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Arms inspectors see this as an Iraqi tactic to bring
international politics into what is essentially a technical
operation to disarm Iraq and destroy its capacity to make new
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Butler also provided the Security Council Thursday with results
of a technical evaluation in July of Iraq's ``full, final and
complete disclosure'' on biological weapons, a document the Iraqis
say closes the file on that issue. This was the third such
technical evaluation demanded by Iraq over the last year, and its
findings were no different than earlier ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new material was presented by Iraq at this meeting,''
Butler wrote in his report of the July technical evaluation. The
international experts again concluded that Iraq's latest disclosure
``was not adequate to allow for credible verification.''
</P>
<P>
   The biological experts _ whom, the Iraqis said, had been
``brainwashed by UNSCOM'' _ found problems with Iraqi accounts of
what they had done with bombs, warheads, spraying devices or
quantities of the agents themselves, including botulinum toxin,
anthrax bacillus and aflatoxin.
</P>
<P>
   During the meetings in Baghdad, the Iraqis refused to discuss
substantive issues, but demanded that sanctions be lifted because
there was no more disarming to be done. On Thursday Bill
Richardson, the U.S. representative, who was brought back from
vacation for the Security Council meeting, called the Iraqi demand
``disarmament by ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen,'' he said.

A BOX WITHIN A BOX TO BLOCK OUT NOISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MUSIC-SEATTLE-SFCHRON)  
 By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In addition to all the usual challenges of
concert-hall acoustics, the designers of Seattle's Benaroya Hall
faced a particularly acute problem: external noise.
</P>
<P>
   Situated downtown, the hall has to contend with the noise of
traffic on two busy city streets, as well as a major bus route
running along one side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's a train line running directly underneath.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the extraneous noise out of the hall, design partner
Mark Reddington of LMN Architects created a plan by which the main
concert hall is structurally isolated from the outside world _ a
box within a box within a box.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the concert hall, patrons step through a series of
doors designed to operate like an air lock. Then another built-in
gap separates the internal structure from its protecting wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was all built,'' Reddington says, ``we had to go over
it inch by inch, shining flashlights down into the gap to make sure
nothing had dropped down there that would make a bridge to the
outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the bottom of the hall? Sound-absorbent rubber
does the trick. The hall rests on a network of 310 rubber bearings,
intermeshed with 210 more bearings designed to brace the hall
laterally.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reddington, the architects had to calculate how far
the hall would settle on the rubber, in order to make the inner and
outer floors line up properly. And yes, in theory, dropping the
hall from a height would result in a nice rebound.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, though, when the rubber starts to wear out? There
is a way to get access to individual bearings, although Reddington
says it would be dauntingly involved.
</P>
<P>
   But according to project manager Andrew Clapham, each bearing
was individually tested for up to 150 percent of its expected load,
and each has an anticipated life span of 150 years. ``That should
be long enough to get me out of the picture, at least.''

SEATTLE SYMPHONY FINDS A HOME IN A RUBBER HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE &LR;   &LR; _ Benaroya Hall, the nearly completed new home of the
Seattle Symphony, promises two intimate performance spaces, a
spacious lobby, attractive design and, if all goes according to
plan, fine acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if you dropped it on the ground it might bounce.
</P>
<P>
   The system of rubber bearings that supports the main concert
hall, designed to keep it free from outside noise, may be the new
building's most unusual aspect. But the $118 million structure,
which will open next month in downtown Seattle, seems likely to
have a big impact on the city's cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   The big unknown is the success of the hall's acoustics, which
will be put to the test during a gala series of concerts Sept.
12-19. Music director Gerard Schwarz will lead the symphony in a
handful of orchestral concerts with guest soloists Jessye Norman,
Yo-Yo Ma and more, and there will be solo appearances by violinist
Kyung-Wha Chung, pop-jazz trumpeter Chuck Mangione and pop legend
Gladys Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a recent guided tour through the hall _ named
after Seattleites Rebecca and Jack Benaroya, who donated $15
million to the project _ revealed a building of enormous beauty and
elegance, with an inviting mix of spaciousness and intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by the Seattle-based firm LMN Architects, working with
acoustical guru Cyril Harris, the hall occupies 187,000 square feet
covering a city block bounded by Second and Third avenues and by
University and Union streets.
</P>
<P>
   The main facade, a rounded form of glass and stone, faces the
newly rejuvenated Second Avenue, across from the Seattle Art
Museum. At the rear, running the length of the building along Third
Avenue, will be a public arcade with shops, cafes, the ticket
office and access to public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Public artworks will be featured prominently. The arcade is
flanked by a pair of intricate lighting installations by Seattle
glass artist Dale Chihuly, each resembling a Medusa-like swarm of
coiling snakes.
</P>
<P>
   The main lobby, exquisitely lit by the glass facade, will be
dominated by a Robert Rauschenberg mural measuring 50 feet by 12
feet. And a sculpture by Mark di Suvero titled ``Schubert Sonata,''
currently on display at the Seattle Art Museum, will also be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   For musical performances, the building includes both a
2,500-seat main concert hall and a 541-seat recital hall. The main
hall, a traditional ``shoe box'' design featuring a new pipe organ
by Massachusetts builder C.B. Fisk, is _ visually at least _ a
stunner.
</P>
<P>
   The seats feel close to the stage, both at the orchestra level
and in the side boxes and the top balcony. The dark wood paneling
on the side walls gives the place a gleaming intensity; for the
sake of acoustical evenness, the entire space has been paneled with
the wood from a single South African mahogany tree.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of Benaroya Hall promises to ease this city's
concert-hall gridlock, a situation that should ring a bell for San
Franciscans who remember life before Davies Symphony Hall was built
in 1980. Currently, Seattle's symphony, ballet and opera companies
all perform in the Seattle Center Opera House, which leads to
fierce competition for access to the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Seattle Symphony restricted to giving concerts
midweek, but the orchestra can't even rehearse in the same space
where it performs.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the move will be evident immediately: According
to a symphony spokesperson, the orchestra's 1998-99 concert season
will feature 30 percent more performances than the current year.

CONGO REBELS SEIZE OIL PORT, ATTACKING KABILA ON 2 FRONTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Rebels in Congo on Thursday seized
control of a strategic oil port in the far west, according to rebel
spokesmen and foreign diplomats, significantly widening their
campaign to wrest power from President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the town, Moanda, an important oil depot to the
southwest of Kinshasa, and the nearby city of Banana, confirms the
dramatic opening of a second front in a five-day-old battle that
had been largely confined to Congo's far east.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the government said the rebels hijacked a Boeing 707
aircraft in the east and flew it 1,000 miles west, to the town of
Kitona, where soldiers from the defeated army of President Mobutu
Sese Seko were being retrained for service in Kabila's army by
instructors on loan from Rwanda. The rebels wanted to rally these
soldiers to their side, and it appears that these are the rebels
who traveled to the port.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first public appearance since the outbreak of
rebellion, at a news conference in the capital, Kabila on Thursday
threatened to ``take the war back to Rwanda, where it came from.''
The rebellion began Sunday and the rebels quickly took two cities
bordering Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda denies involvement in the current fighting, but according
to Western diplomats, it has emerged as a major backer of the
rebellion. Just 15 months ago, Rwanda backed Kabila against Mobutu.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kabila also said he was preparing ``for a long war, a drawn-out
war, a people's war,'' and said ``ordinary Congolese'' may be
called upon to take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Kabila's threat Thursday, a Rwandan government
spokesman told the BBC: ``Aren't they putting the cart before the
horse? Hadn't they better take care of their problems with the
rebels?''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a western front in Congo, moreover, one so near
to the capital, Kinshasa, comes as bleak news to Kabila, who has
lost nearly all of the international friends who supported his
drive for power, which began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting was reported southwest of the capital, and any
consolidation of the rebels' position would enable them to
interrupt electricity from the huge Inga dam nearby and to stop
food and fuel deliveries to Kinshasa from the country's sole
seaport.
</P>
<P>
   Until the rebellion, Kabila mostly relied on foreign troops, on
loan from Rwanda, to assure security. With those troops gone, he
depends on the very elements of Mobutu's army that his rebellion
defeated, and thousands of recently recruited but untested youths.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Kabila and his former allies in Rwanda have
soured over issues that once united them, including Kabila's
gradual marginalization of Congolese Tutsi _ the ethnic cousins of
Rwanda's leaders _ in his government, and the failure to suppress
anti-Rwanda guerrilla activity in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has not been popular since overthrowing Mobutu, but the
government's nationalist oratory has apparently struck a powerful
chord at least in Kinshasa and other areas of the west, where
interference in the country's affairs by Rwanda is deeply resented.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of feeling against Rwanda and the Tutsi in the west
raises questions about whether the rebel movement could credibly
seize power even if it managed to defeat Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels ``have been trying hard to broaden their base in the
last couple of days and find some non-Tutsi names to identify the
rebellion with, but this is going to be a real problem later,'' a
European diplomat said. ``The people of Congo are not likely to
accept any kind of movement that springs from Rwanda,'' the
diplomat continued. With that in mind, the rebels selected a
Kinshasa politician, Arthur Zaidy Ngoma, who is not Tutsi, as
nominal leader.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration attended by thousands Thursday in the
capital, Congolese youth carried banners denouncing the Rwandans
and the Tutsi in particular, vowing in chanted slogans never to
surrender to their country's smaller neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   There have been persistent reports since the start of the
uprising of a campaign of house-to-house arrests of Congolese Tutsi
in the capital. By those accounts, hundreds of people have been led
away to detention in unknown destinations.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
today that he found credible reports that as many as 800 Tutsi have
been taken to Camp Tshatshi, a military base and former
presidential residence on the outskirts of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila must be made to understand that he will be responsible
for these people,'' a spokesman for the rebellion, Mehta Mwanga
Chuchu, said in telephone interview from Washington. ``Whatever he
does to them, he will have to pay for.''

SAD TRAILS: BABY BOOMERS LOSING THEIR TV HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're falling fatally and disturbingly fast. Roy Rogers,
Buffalo Bob Smith, Shari Lewis _ all representing the last time the
world made sense to the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Young made sense in the 1950s. If you're going to
get a whupping, it might as well be a benign word-whupping by a
kindly insurance agent in a cardigan sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The times seemed so utterly rational that an uncanny number of
icons had repeating initials. Roy Rogers. Marilyn Monroe. Mickey
Mantle. Mickey Mouse. Doris Day. Buffalo Bob.
</P>
<P>
   And Brigitte Bardot, who wafted into the decade on a forbidden
French scent. Marilyn Monroe did comedies. Bardot did sex, and shut
your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided I was wrong, but later in life I felt uncomfortable
with some of these iconic figures, especially the ones associated
with kiddie TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   They never junked their guises. They never changed. They tried
to remain surrogate uncles, aunts and even parents for a generation
that not only outgrew them but also scorned them.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob wore fringe and glowed with giddy enthusiasm until
the end of his days. He probably wanted his obituary to say that he
was survived by Howdy, Dilly Dally, Flub-a-Dub, Mr. Bluster and
that great generational peanut gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers kept the faith, too. He was born someone else
entirely, in Cincinnati, but he became Roy Rogers and stayed Roy
Rogers for all the buckaroos who adored him and then forgot him.
</P>
<P>
   He once said he expected to be stuffed, like his horse Trigger,
when the time came. It's a macabre thought, but not altogether
wrong. The King of the Cowboys, forever frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, once the Lone Ranger on TV, held firm even after
the rights-holders stripped him of his mask. He switched to
wraparound sunglasses and kept firing silver bullet blanks.
</P>
<P>
   I was on a TV press tour, years back, when Moore strode into the
back of the room early one morning and announced his arrival by
firing his gun. Dozens of critics nearly had heart attacks, then
spun around angrily to see who'd splattered their eardrums.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that when you saw it was the Lone Ranger, in
the flesh, you felt a very odd mix of sensations. Whatever else
Moore is doing these days, I'm sure he's still Kemosabe.
</P>
<P>
   They were constant; we were malleable. Jay Ward came along with
Rocky the flying squirrel and Bullwinkle the moose, and by
increments the world changed. Fracturing fairy tales and teaching
us, charmingly, that heroes like Dudley Do-Right were dumb as
bricks, Ward planted the first seeds of subversion. You've got to
start growing up sometime, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   As life became a succession of political assassinations, wars,
scandals, careers, families and mutual funds, the figures from our
TV closets devolved into dusty, awkward quaintness. Among them,
only Shari Lewis, with her Lamb Chop sock puppet, seemed capable of
self-renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But think again. These were people who, upon their honor, would
not abandon us. They probably knew we scoffed at them as silly
anachronisms, and still they loved us. They no longer needed the
money, in most cases. They'd simply accepted lifelong
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>

SAD TRAILS: BABY BOOMERS LOSING THEIR TV HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're falling fatally and disturbingly fast. Roy Rogers,
Buffalo Bob Smith, Shari Lewis _ all representing the last time the
world made sense to the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Young made sense in the 1950s. If you're going to
get a whupping, it might as well be a benign word-whupping by a
kindly insurance agent in a cardigan sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The times seemed so utterly rational that an uncanny number of
icons had repeating initials. Roy Rogers. Marilyn Monroe. Mickey
Mantle. Mickey Mouse. Doris Day. Buffalo Bob.
</P>
<P>
   And Brigitte Bardot, who wafted into the decade on a forbidden
French scent. Marilyn Monroe did comedies. Bardot did sex, and shut
your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided I was wrong, but later in life I felt uncomfortable
with some of these iconic figures, especially the ones associated
with kiddie TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   They never junked their guises. They never changed. They tried
to remain surrogate uncles, aunts and even parents for a generation
that not only outgrew them but also scorned them.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob wore fringe and glowed with giddy enthusiasm until
the end of his days. He probably wanted his obituary to say that he
was survived by Howdy, Dilly Dally, Flub-a-Dub, Mr. Bluster and
that great generational peanut gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers kept the faith, too. He was born someone else
entirely, in Cincinnati, but he became Roy Rogers and stayed Roy
Rogers for all the buckaroos who adored him and then forgot him.
</P>
<P>
   He once said he expected to be stuffed, like his horse Trigger,
when the time came. It's a macabre thought, but not altogether
wrong. The King of the Cowboys, forever frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, once the Lone Ranger on TV, held firm even after
the rights-holders stripped him of his mask. He switched to
wraparound sunglasses and kept firing silver bullet blanks.
</P>
<P>
   I was on a TV press tour, years back, when Moore strode into the
back of the room early one morning and announced his arrival by
firing his gun. Dozens of critics nearly had heart attacks, then
spun around angrily to see who'd splattered their eardrums.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that when you saw it was the Lone Ranger, in
the flesh, you felt a very odd mix of sensations. Whatever else
Moore is doing these days, I'm sure he's still Kemosabe.
</P>
<P>
   They were constant; we were malleable. Jay Ward came along with
Rocky the flying squirrel and Bullwinkle the moose, and by
increments the world changed. Fracturing fairy tales and teaching
us, charmingly, that heroes like Dudley Do-Right were dumb as
bricks, Ward planted the first seeds of subversion. You've got to
start growing up sometime, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   As life became a succession of political assassinations, wars,
scandals, careers, families and mutual funds, the figures from our
TV closets devolved into dusty, awkward quaintness. Among them,
only Shari Lewis, with her Lamb Chop sock puppet, seemed capable of
self-renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But think again. These were people who, upon their honor, would
not abandon us. They probably knew we scoffed at them as silly
anachronisms, and still they loved us. They no longer needed the
money, in most cases. They'd simply accepted lifelong
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe kids made decent choices in the first place, all those
decades ago. Constancy. Love. Responsibility. We knew heroes; we
just stopped wanting them.

RED SOX PICK UP ASTROS LEFTY SCHOUREK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Dan Duquette couldn't get Randy Johnson, so
he made a deal for the pitcher the Big Unit bumped out of Houston's
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek, a 29-year-old lefthander who has undergone elbow
surgery in each of the last two seasons and was a seven-game winner
for the Astros this season, cleared waivers Thursday and was picked
up by the Red Sox for what Duquette described as cash
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a winning major league pitcher who pitched effectively as
a starter for the Astros,'' said Duquette, who is believed to have
agreed to pay a portion of the incentives in Schourek's contract.
``We've added a starting pitcher with playoff experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who has pitched exclusively as a starter for the last
four seasons, probably will bump Steve Avery out of the Sox
rotation and into the bullpen, though manager Jimy Williams refused
Thursday to reveal his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a new pitcher,'' Williams said. ``We'll have to
figure that out. We already have five starters right now. We'll
have to reevaluate the situation if we decide to start him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Schourek may take Avery's place in the rotation, his first
order of business when he joins the Red Sox today may be to make
peace with ace Pedro Martinez. On Sept. 28, 1995, when Schourek was
pitching for the Cincinnati Reds, he hit Martinez with a pitch, an
act Martinez claims was deliberate, and the Sox pitcher hasn't
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me on purpose,'' said Martinez, who one inning before
had hit Reds catcher Benito Santiago in the hand with a pitch and
said Schourek was aiming for his ribs when he stuck up his left arm
in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it look like it was (retaliation), but that was back
when I was supposed to be a headhunter. They all wanted to get me,
the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Expos manager Felipe Alou admonished Martinez that day not to
throw at Schourek, who also hit Wilfredo Cordero in the same game,
but Martinez said he was just waiting for the opportunity to
retaliate. He thought it had come on Opening Day the following
season when he was supposed to face Schourek in Cincinnati, but
umpire John McSherry collapsed and died at home plate and the game
was rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept looking for him to hit him,'' Martinez said, ``but I
never faced him again. Now he's my teammate. Small world.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez intends to broach the subject when Schourek arrives.
``I hope I get to know he's a better person than I'm thinking,''
Martinez said. ``I'm going to ask him why he hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek's career in some ways resembles that of Avery, and on
one major occasion coincided: While with the Braves, Avery beat
Schourek and the Reds in the deciding game of the 1995 National
League Championship Series, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was an 18-game winner for the Reds that season,
finished second in the Cy Young Award voting to Greg Maddux of the
Braves, and was Cincinnati's Opening Day starter the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   But like Avery, Schourek, who broke in with the Mets in 1991,
ran into injury problems. He won just nine games in the next two
years, underwent elbow surgery to tighten the ligaments in 1996,
and had another operation to clean out the elbow after last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wanted Schourek to undergo elbow reconstruction, but he
reportedly balked, fearing the operation would end his career. He
signed a minor league deal with the Astros, made the club out of
spring training, and joined the rotation as the fifth starter in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Like Avery, Schourek was primarily a six-inning pitcher. Three
times he pitched seven innings, but in seven of his 15 starts, he
went five innings or fewer. Overall, he was 7-6 with a 4.50 ERA and
won his last two starts, the most recent a 10-6 win over the
Marlins last Wednesday in which he gave up eight hits and six runs
in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   When the Astros obtained Johnson at the trading deadline last
Friday, Schourek became expendable, and the Sox swooped in.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Red Sox decide to carry 12 pitchers,
one more than they have all season. At the moment, the Sox have six
outfielders, so if Avery goes to the bullpen, they could send down
seldom-used outfielder Keith Mitchell.

ANALYSIS: ELECTION FRAUD REPORTS STIR DOUBTS ABOUT DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodia's election nearly two weeks ago
may, for a while at least, produce the political stability that
people here yearn for. But it is not clear whether it has advanced
the cause of democracy that the outside world has worked hard to
implant here since the start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging reports of electoral manipulation and a campaign of
fear at the local level have led some political experts to suggest
that for many Cambodians, the lesson of this election is that the
will of the people must still bow to the raw power of their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The quick stamp of approval by international observers, followed
by their quick departure from Cambodia, has left many people here
feeling abandoned and bewildered. The trade-off _ political
stability _ is not quite here yet. And given this nation's history
of political turmoil and the mutual animosities of its leaders, a
stable Cambodia in the long term would be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the national election committee announced that the
incumbent leader, Hun Sen, had won a majority of the 122 seats in
Parliament, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government
without creating a coalition with his rivals. Opposition parties
are challenging the count and threatening to paralyze the opening
of Parliament six weeks from now with a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   And reports continued to accumulate Thursday of a sort of
political cleansing in villages around the country where threats of
reprisals are forcing supporters of opposition parties to flee.
</P>
<P>
   But most political experts predict that after a period of
political theater, threats and horse-trading _ and even a possible
constitutional crisis _ that could last well into the fall, the
second-place finisher, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, is likely to join
Hun Sen in some form of coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, he will be under intense pressure from his
party to take a share of the spoils of government,'' a senior aid
worker said. ``What's in it for them to stay out in the cold?''
</P>
<P>
   That outcome carries its share of irony. After muscling his way
into a coalition leadership with Ranariddh after the prince won the
last election, in 1993, Hun Sen pushed the prince overboard in a
coup one year ago and declared, ``I am the only captain of the
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The clear domination of Hun Sen's party this time around, and
the weakening of military forces loyal to Ranariddh, may, through
force of arms and politics, create a more stable situation than
under the dual premiership of the previous government.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup last year, Hun Sen's supporters systematically
killed about 100 members of the opposition, monopolized the
broadcast media, took control of the mechanisms of the political
campaign, intimidated the voters and then invited the prince to
return from exile and take part in a free election.
</P>
<P>
   Election day, July 26, was an uplifting demonstration of the
desire of Cambodians to exercise their mandate, as more than 90
percent of eligible voters crowded into polling places. Foreign
election monitors were thrilled. Some called the spectacle ``a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   But many diplomats and aid workers who live here were incensed
at this quick-draw assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has been perpetually in turmoil for the last 30
years,'' a diplomat said. ``It's going to take more than one Sunday
of relative peace and quiet to change that. It is incredibly
disingenuous and intellectually dishonest as well as possibly
immoral for the international community to come in here and say,
`OK, you have democracy,' when the reality on the ground is much
different.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to quantify the effects of any threats or
manipulation by the governing party. But the picture of voting day
that has emerged in reports from Cambodian and foreign observers
suggests that a good deal more was going on than was apparent on
the surface.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Voters had already been given the message in the previous weeks
and months that there was a right and wrong way to vote. Hun Sen's
party members, who virtually monopolize local and provincial
government, had thumb-printed voters, collected and held their
voting cards and selectively threatened, attacked and sometimes
killed villagers who opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   On voting day, those same party functionaries ran the polling
stations, sending a signal that, as one foreign monitor put it,
``we'll still be here tomorrow, and you're still going to have to
live with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of ballot manipulation was used at the polling
stations, said the election monitor, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. With a population that is more than 60 percent
illiterate, polling station staff marked ballots for many people,
the election monitor said. They sometimes engaged in a system of
``telegraph'' voting, in which pre-marked ballots were substituted
for clean ones. Once the count was under way, a disproportionate
number of opposition ballots were ruled invalid.
</P>
<P>
   There are unconfirmed allegations of larger-scale manipulation
that may have involved the switching of ballot boxes and the
massaging of vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard people say that next time they won't vote _ it
makes no difference anyway,'' a European diplomat said. ``A lot of
people see this election not as a democratic exercise but as a tool
by Hun Sen to perpetuate his power. They feel used.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years leading up to the 1993 election, the United
Nations employed 20,000 foreign aid workers here and spent more
than $2 billion in an effort to plant the seeds of democracy in one
of the world's most battered and suffering countries.
</P>
<P>
   The years since then have been a struggle between Cambodia's
violent past and the small but growing corps of people who have
embraced the United Nations' democratic ideals. The country has a
wildly free press _ though journalists are sometimes killed _ and a
vigorous sector of private groups focusing on human rights, the
rights of women and children, legal reforms, environmental
protection and the alleviation of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   They are the real opposition to Hun Sen's monopoly of power.
</P>
<P>
   Now that representatives of other countries have returned
briefly, pronounced themselves satisfied and left again, Hun Sen
may feel himself under less pressure to permit this range of
democratic activity, said Thomas Hammarberg, the human rights envoy
to Cambodia from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the international community is that interest
moves from country to country,'' he said. ``Cambodia is now in
danger of being forgotten.''

MARKET PLACE: HOW FAR CAN DONNA KARAN GO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like any stock that hits the skids after its initial
public offering, Donna Karan International has attracted some
contrarian investors.
</P>
<P>
   And the financial condition of the fashion house has improved.
Thursday, the company announced that it had narrowed its loss in
the second quarter by 57.1 percent from a year earlier and that
revenue had risen to $124.9 million, from $111 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial question is how far can this company really go
in imitating its more successful brethren on Seventh Avenue. You
know, Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Donna Karan brought in John Idol as chief executive
after several wretched money-losing quarters with her at the helm.
Idol, who was hired away from Polo Ralph Lauren, wasted no time in
shaking things up. He proclaimed that the company's future included
far more licensed businesses and free-standing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, he sealed a licensing deal with Estee Lauder Cos.
for Donna Karan's beauty business. The move was long overdue, since
production costs had wiped out much of the beauty products'
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he negotiated a licensing deal for the men's and
women's jeans and casual wear business, known as DKNY Jeans, with
Liz Claiborne Inc., under which Donna Karan got $30 million right
off the bat and a percentage of sales in the Western Hemisphere. A
license to market and produce DKNY and to sell Donna Karan's
high-end clothing in Japan was put together with a partner there,
although that business has been weak because of the country's
worsening economy. Some smaller deals were cut as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karan's infamous spending was also reined in. Reductions in
advertising and marketing helped the company cut costs for selling,
general and administrative purposes to 28.9 percent of net revenue
in the second quarter, from 39.8 percent a year earlier. The
company's net loss narrowed to $6.3 million, from $14.7 million in
the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems he is doing all the right things,'' said Marc Ravitz,
vice president of Grace &AMP; White Inc., New York, an investment
group, which recently bought Donna Karan stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock remains mired far below the initial offering price
of $24 in mid-1996. It closed Thursday at $11.75, down 37.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Idol's licensing strategy is understandable, given its
extraordinary success at Polo Ralph Lauren, whose name graces
everything from towels to T-shirts to bras to house paint. Most of
the strong fashion companies rely on such licensees to bolster
profits and reduce overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But companies with successful licensing businesses have
something in common _a sterling name. Donna Karan is revered on the
West and East Coasts for her high-end duds and her 1980s move to
offer high-powered career women clothing antidotes to bow ties and
padded shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In the South and Midwest, it is a different story. Calls to a
randomly selected group of stores there recently found that three
out of seven sales clerks did not know the name.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Ms. Karan rose to fame among urban career women, who
remain her core market, along with Barbra Streisand and a bevy of
starlets. What is more, her most expensive line, which sets the
tone for the entire fashion house, has gotten more ethereal in
recent years. The fall collection of padded dresses, for example,
is not likely to be a hit among women wearing anything bigger than
a size 4 or the very baby boomers she once cultivated. The company
recently reintroduced her line of Donna Karan ``essentials'' _
basic career clothes _ but that line is not getting significant
marketing support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, by contrast, tends to create a much tamer high-end
line, one influenced by American sportswear. And his signature item
is worn in every corner of the country _ the simple pullover polo
shirt. Ms. Karan has no such mainstream piece of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not true that everyone knows Donna Karan's name,'' said
Faye Landes, one of the few retailing stock analysts who still
track the company. ``Part of the brilliance of Tommy and Ralph is
that they have a name known around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Building a name from China to Wyoming and the sales to back it
up takes time. Calvin Klein started his business in 1968, and last
year his revenue was about $5.1 billion. Ms. Karan, whose business
began in 1984, had revenue last year of $638.7 million, about the
size of Klein's fragrance business. Also, Ralph Lauren and Calvin
Klein have spent millions more than Ms. Karan has on marketing to
build name awareness.
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, Ms. Karan's ability to generate substantially
more licensing business seems questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, she gave away her best chance at reaching middle America:
the jeans business. The DKNY Jeans products from Liz Claiborne are
similar to Donna Karan's secondary DKNY line, but cheaper. This has
hurt DKNY. Gross profit at Donna Karan International decreased to
19.8 percent of sales last quarter, from 20.4 percent in 1997, and
sales of the men's business fell 6.6 percent largely as a result of
Liz Claiborne's getting the best part of that business.
</P>
<P>
   Idol said in an interview this week: ``The reality is that
licensing will always appear as a small percentage of revenues, and
wholesale will always be the dominant revenue part of the company.
But as a percentage of earnings, it will be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale business has been less than stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the women's business rose 12.1 percent in the latest
quarter, but people who recently left the company and who agreed to
be interviewed on the condition that their names not be used said
the company had sold big chunks of DKNY fall inventory to off-price
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Idol denied that the sales to those stores were heavier than
usual. Still, a spokeswoman at Sam's Club, a unit of Wal-Mart
Stores, which rarely has access to such merchandise, said that it
now has DKNY in stock, and a merchant at another off-price company
said its warehouse stores had picked up some merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Such sales do not bode well for margins going forward. What is
more, some retailers say they have lightened their orders of the
company's men's clothes for fall, because of general weakness in
the category.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the question of Ms. Karan's stores. She has 65
stores abroad and 49 outlet stores in the United States, and she
plans to open one Donna Karan and three DKNY stores domestically
this year. But this is not a low-cost proposition. A
1,200-square-foot store on Madison Avenue, for example, can rent
for $400 to $500 a square foot, or $480,000 to $600,000 a year, and
building stores from scratch is costly.
</P>
<P>
   A final note. As part of the initial public offering back in
1996, Ms. Karan struck a deal to get 1.75 percent of the first $250
million of net sales each year, rising to 3.5 percent of sales that
exceed $1.5 billion. Shareholders derided her at the annual meeting
this year for keeping this share in the wake of poor performance,
but she argued that other designers do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her deal we are not too happy with,'' said Lawrence Manley, a
portfolio manager at Manley Fuller Asset Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiment alone may keep all but bottom-fishing investors
away from the flashy house of fashion.

   WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department said Thursday that it would
open a new expanse of the Alaska North Slope wilderness to oil and
gas leasing, but it limited drilling in some areas that the
industry is most eager to explore.
</P>
<P>
   To protect lakes where migrating geese molt and the main calving
area of the local caribou herd, the Interior Department refused to
allow development in an area north and east of Teshekpuk Lake near
the Beaufort Sea, a coastal plain as rich in wildlife as it
probably is in oil.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a decision that was widely
anticipated, said oil companies would be allowed to look for oil on
four million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve, west of the
Prudhoe Bay oil fields where oil wells already feed the
trans-Alaskan pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The petroleum reserve is a 23-million-acre tract between the
Brooks Range and the Arctic, set aside since 1923 as a strategic
reserve. The northeastern one-fifth of the reserve is thought to
hold about half a billion barrels of oil, about a month's supply
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the leasing of oil and gas in the reserve in
1981, but the oil industry became more interested in recent years
as oil and gas development approached the boundaries from the east.
Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, asked President Clinton to
allow leasing, and the Interior Department has been studying the
question for 18 months. Conservation groups have opposed leasing
there because the land provides habitat for fish, birds and
caribou. But unlike the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the
east, the land is not set aside for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The plan establishes various restrictions on development in
different parts of the tract, depending mainly on the use by
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the goose-molting area was kept off limits. But in
some sections, only activity on the surface is barred, so oil
companies could drill into these lands from the side. In other
areas, conditions are imposed to minimize disruption of the caribou
herds, to protect the riverside nesting sites of peregrine falcons
and other raptors and to keep permanent oil and gas equipment away
from the shores of lakes that are deep enough to hold fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department refused to allow development on 600,000
acres of the 4.6-million-acre tract that it studied for possible
leasing. Much of the land that it put off limits is around
Teshekpuk Lake and the coastal plain where the oil industry
believes the richest deposits lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terribly shortsighted decision,'' said William
Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society, an environmental
organization based in Washington. ``This reserve contains some
world-class wildlife habitat, vital to grizzly bears, caribou and
millions of shorebirds, ducks, and geese.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt visited the area for several days last year and ordered
extensive scientific consultations before making his decision. He
said his plan had addressed the major environmental concerns and
the needs of residents who subsist on caribou, fish and marine
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan said it was unwise to begin producing oil
from a strategic reserve at a time when oil is plentiful and cheap.
Babbitt said that oil leasing would not begin until next year,
followed by exploration, and that production would be unlikely to
begin for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Meyers, president of Arco Alaska, a unit of the Atlantic
Richfield Company, said that he was pleased the Interior Department
was recommending a lease sale but regretted that more of the
coastal area was not to be opened.

U.S. STRATEGY: KEEP THE PRESSURE ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (With IRAQ-U.N.)  
(lh) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States vowed Thursday to ``keep the
pressure on'' to persuade Iraq to end its defiance of U.N. arms
inspectors, but said it was too early to contemplate a military
response to the latest standoff between Iraq and the United
Nations. Iraq announced on Wednesday that it would end all
cooperation with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noncompliance is completely unacceptable,'' said P.J. Crowley,
a White House spokesman. ``We will not allow Iraq access to
resources necessary to restart their weapons of mass destruction
program. We will continue to keep the pressure on until Iraq
complies fully with their obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, echoing these
statements, noted that this was not the first time that Baghdad had
refused to cooperate with the arms inspections, only to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this time and time again,'' he said. ``We're not
calling it a crisis because, frankly, we don't want to play into
Saddam Hussein's hands. Clearly he's in a box. He's trying to
squirm his way out. He's trying to provoke a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said it had ``a very adequate force'' in
the region of the Persian Gulf _ 19,000 troops, 167 planes and the
aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln _ to deal with Iraq in the case of
any military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the Iraqis' apparent motive
was to provoke a crisis in hope that it would further divide the
United States from other members of the U.N. Security Council,
especially Russia and France, who have sought to lift the economic
and military sanctions imposed on Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, Iraq called for the inspection team, the
U.N. Special Commission, to move its headquarters to Geneva or
Vienna, Austria, from New York to reduce what Baghdad sees as undue
U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious effort _ and it's not the first time _ on
the part of the Iraqis to characterize this as a confrontation
between Iraq and the United States, and we categorically reject
that characterization,'' Foley said. ``The fact of the matter is
that the confrontation, if there is one, is between Iraq and the
U.N.''

JACK BRICKHOUSE, LONGTIME CUBS' ANNOUNCER, 82  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Brickhouse, whose avuncular cheer and exuberant
storytelling imbued his calls of more than 5,000 Chicago Cubs and
White Sox games, died Thursday of cardiac arrest at St. Joseph
Hospital in Chicago, said a spokeswoman. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, Chicago fans have lost two beloved baseball
announcers, Brickhouse, and the flamboyant Harry Caray, who died on
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Brickhouse has been rehabilitating from surgery to remove a
brain tumor last March 3, but was seen recently at various events
in Chicago. In late June, he was a guest announcer for three
innings of a Cubs game on WGN-TV.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to attend a Cubs' charity event Wednesday night
but called to say that he was feeling ill, said Jay Blunk, the
Cubs' advertising director.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Peoria in 1916, Brickhouse chose breeziness over bombast
as his broadcasting style. He was short on criticism, long on hope
and simple charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard sports first and foremost as entertainment,'' he once
said. ``I like the `let's forget our troubles and have some
excitement' approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his home run call was a simple, friendly,
rumbling exclamation, familiar to denizens of Wrigley Field or
Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back, back, back!'' he started, then pausing to see if the
ball was struck far enough. ``That's it!'' he added. ``Hey-hey!
Hey-hey!''
</P>
<P>
   Chet Coppock, a Chicago sportscaster, said, ``In the 1950s,
`hey-hey' meant the Eisenhower administration and a wonderful stock
market. In the 1960s, it was a dose of reality during a changing
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Brickhouse's career began at age 18 at a radio station in his
hometown of Peoria. He came to Chicago in 1940, and with breaks for
military service and a year to call New York Giants baseball games,
Brickhouse called Cubs games from 1941 to 1981 and White Sox games
from 1940 to 1967 on WGN Radio or TV.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, he would call the home games of the
crosstown rivals, an unusual feat in local sportscasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have thought some people would hate him for that, but he
was manifestly a person of good will,'' said Curt Smith, a
sportscasting historian.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sportscasters of the 1940s and 1950s, Brickhouse
covered myriad events, and was part of the transition from radio to
television. His was the first voice heard on WGN-TV when it signed
on in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chicago Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, Brickhouse
called Chicago Bears games for 24 years. He also called Chicago
Bulls, Zephyrs and Packers basketball games, Notre Dame football
games, wrestling, golf and boxing, and covered five national
political conventions and Franklin Roosevelt's 1945 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Brickhouse retired as one of the Cubs' regular announcers after
the 1981 season _ succeeded by Caray, who left the White Sox _ and
received the Ford C. Frick for broadcasting excellence by the
Baseball Hall of Fame two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, fans flocked to his ``Walk of Fame'' stone outside
Wrigley to pay their respects. The famous red Wrigley sign said,
``We'll miss you, Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Brickhouse is survived by his second wife, Patricia; a daughter,
Jean Sky, from his first marriage, and a grandson.

RENO WOULD BE TRIED IN FEDERAL COURT IF CONTEMPT ACTION PROCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with RENO-CONTEMPT)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is doubtful that the case will go that far, but
if the full House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General
Janet Reno in contempt, she would be prosecuted in federal court,
most likely by the U.S. attorney's office in the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   If a grand jury indicted her and the dispute with Congress were
not settled one way or another, she would go to trial. If
convicted, she could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined up to
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fine might not seem like much, but $1,000 was a lot of money
in 1857, when Congress passed a law specifically authorizing
punishment for contempt of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, prosecution of the attorney general for contempt seems
rather far-fetched at this point, largely because only one federal
official, Anne Burford, has ever been held in contempt of Congress
for refusing to produce information on grounds of executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1982, Mrs. Burford, who was Anne Gorsuch before her
marriage in 1983, refused on orders from President Ronald Reagan to
produce documents related to an investigation of the Environmental
Protection Agency, which she headed at the time. That brought a
contempt citation in 1983, but it was canceled after the Reagan
administration yielded enough documents to satisfy a House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, 1982, another House committee voted to cite Interior
Secretary James Watt for contempt for refusing to turn over
documents sought by investigators, but that dispute was settled
when Reagan gave committee members enough access to the papers to
satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   It has been far more common for Congress to hold private
citizens in contempt when they have been deemed uncooperative in
investigations of criminal activities or, in the years after World
War II, inquiries into supposed communist infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional power to punish contempt, while never spelled
out in the Constitution, has been clear since the early 19th
century, when a land dealer named John Anderson tried to bribe a
House member. Incensed, Speaker Henry Clay had Anderson hauled
before the House, where he was upbraided and held briefly in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, Anderson sued the House sergeant-at-arms for false
arrest. The sergeant-at-arms insisted that he had acted within his
authority, whether the Constitution explicitly said so or not. In
1821, the Supreme Court agreed with him.

 &HT;    N.C. show reveals fate of unadopted animals
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C._ Sheriff BJ Barnes plans to use his weekly
television program today to show a dog being killed at the Guilford
County Animal Shelter, his way of illustrating the plight of
unwanted pets.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-second videotape segment already has pricked the nation's
fascination with animal euthanasia through snippets aired on
national TV news shows. The videotape shows a mixed breed dog
collapsing from lethal injection and being placed in a 55-gallon
disposal drum with other dead dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and do not think their little Fluffy is going
to be put to sleep,'' said Lisa Boughton, a veterinary technician
in Guilford County, where more than 10,000 animals were euthanized
last year. ``But little Fluffy is going to be put to sleep if there
is not room for it.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated six million to eight million animals are killed
annually in America's animal shelters because of disease or lack of
homes. ``It is inhumane what is being done here, when the answer
could be spaying and neutering,'' said Sheriff Barnes, 47, the
owner of a spayed Doberman Pinscher named Diamond. He said he has
been swamped by hundreds of phone calls, most praising his planned
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   But in Atlanta, Fulton County's animal control director, Robert
Fisher, said the broadcast is ``going to upset decent people and
isn't going to bother the irresponsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Sinclair, a director with the Humane Society of the
United States, commended Barnes. ``We think it will at least create
a discussion among people, and that is always good,'' Sinclair
said.

 &HT;    Smith suspended four years for tampering with sample
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Is the jig up for Irish swimmer Michelle Smith? The
1996 triple gold medalist at the Atlanta Olympics, whose victories
inspired mass celebration in her homeland, was banned for four
years Thursday after officials ruled that she had tampered with a
urine sample to spike a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   FINA, the international swimming federation, could have imposed
a life ban on Smith, 28, but the four-year suspension achieves the
same purpose by forcing her to miss the 2000 Olympics and the next
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was already considered old at age 26 in Atlanta, when the
remarkable drop in her times aroused suspicion. But Smith never
tested positive for drugs _ and still hasn't. Her downfall: Both
samples from an out-of-competition test in January contained a
lethal concentration of whiskey, which insinuates an attempt at
masking banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, would not comment until a news
conference today in Ireland. He said earlier that she would
consider an appeal to the International Court of Arbitration in
Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids or other banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Smith was anything but clean at the
'96 Games, where she won the 200- and 400-meter individual medleys
and the 400 freestyle, and was third in the 200 butterfly. However,
the case reinforces the belief on the pooldeck that something was
fishy.
</P>
<P>
   As Allison Wagner, who was second in the 400 IM, pointed out
Thursday, ``I don't know of anybody that would start using
performance-enhancing drugs after winning three gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wagner said it was ``a little comforting'' to know that
FINA took a stand to ban Smith, she added, ``They've found the
whiskey, but she still has the gold at home and I still have the
silver, so it's not quite the same satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   As the East German doping trials resume next week, the
International Olympic Committee has promised to evaluate Olympic
results from the 1970s and '80s on a case-by-case basis, given the
testimony that athletes took steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see that they would take a look at this one,'' U.S.
Swimming president Carol Zaleski said of Smith's case. ``There
really isn't proof that she was doing it back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``This test is the first real evidence of
wrongdoing. It certainly supports some of the suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion also was fueled by the fact that Smith's husband and
coach, Erik de Bruin, is a former discus thrower who was banned for
using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I showed up at the Olympics, I'd never heard of her
before,'' said Wagner, who has the dubious distinction of also
placing second at the 1994 World Championships to China's Lu Bin,
who tested positive for steroids a month later. After the Olympics,
people told Wagner that she was the champion ``because everybody
doubted Michelle's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a hero in Ireland during the summer of '96, Smith had
to defend herself to the rest of the world. She has been so hounded
by the drug rumors that her endorsement opportunities suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose best previous Olympic finish was 17th in 1988, said
she didn't take drugs. Her plight drew the admiration of President
Clinton, who congratulated Smith during the Games. ``He told me, 'I
admire the way you handled all the crap that they're throwing at
you. We've had to deal with that ourselves,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   FINA's doping panel, which heard Smith's case two weeks ago,
said its investigation found that the urine was ``manipulated by
the swimmer but the way of manipulation is uncertain.'' FINA said
it found that the manipulation was not carried out in the
laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who hasn't swum in a major competition since winning two
events at the 1997 Europeans, stressed the fact that no banned
substance has been detected in her urine, FINA said. She also
stated that
</P>
<P>
   ``from her side there was no physical manipulation of the
sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaleski said that the observer who witnessed the test _
observers are supposed to watch the athletes urinate _ testified
that Smith was in a baggy sweater that came down to her knees. The
observer couldn't see her produce the urine, but heard the
appropriate sound.
</P>
<P>
   FINA said the content of alcohol in the sample was ``in no way
compatible with human consumption and the sample shows a very
strong whiskey odour.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not the first swimmer accused of tampering. Prior to
the 1992 Olympics, East Germany's Katrin Krabbe and two others were
suspended for four years because of a ``suspicious'' drug test in
which their three clean samples all apparently came from the same
person. The suspension was overturned on appeal, but Krabbe later
tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the sports world has been slammed by
allegations of drug use in the Tour de France and by the
drug-related suspensions of Olympic track and field athletes Dennis
Mitchell and Randy Barnes and U.S. swimming's Gary Hall Jr.

HOUSE APPROVES SHAYS-MEEHAN BILL ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending a struggle that has gone on for months, the
House on Thursday approved a bipartisan bill to overhaul the way
the nation's political campaigns are financed and shifted the
spotlight back onto the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a final rebuke to the Republican leadership, the House vote
for passage of the measure sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., was 252-179. That was even
stronger than a preliminary vote earlier in the week. Sixty-one
Republicans split from their party to back the bill, while 15
Democrats broke party lines to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprising resiliency of the issue in the House, the
legislation is thought to have little chance in the Senate, where
it obtained bare majority support earlier this year and died in a
Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate has dealt with this issue already,'' said John
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
``There's no more of a consensus now than there was in the
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartened by a victory that would have seemed improbable
just a few months ago, the bipartisan House coalition immediately
turned its attention to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the House vote, Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., waved in
the air the green-covered record of last year's hearings in the
Senate, led by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., Tennessee, into
campaign finance abuses of the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate started this process,'' said Wamp. ``We have paved
the way. And we want the American people to weigh in over the next
five weeks, get on the phone and get the Senate to take this issue
back up in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, said Lott should be asked ``a simple
question _ what's wrong with a bill that has majority support in
the House of Representatives and majority support in the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would effectively end the unlimited
and unregulated donations to the political parties, known as soft
money, which have increasingly been used to evade the limits on
contributions to individual candidates that were enacted in the
wake of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It would also curb the practice, which has been growing in
recent elections, of independent groups running ads attacking or
supporting a candidate. The bill would more strictly regulate such
ads that identify a candidate within 60 days of an election.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is opposed by most Republicans, who say it violates
constitutional guarantees of free speech and weakens political
parties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., said that Watergate-era limits on
donations to individual candidates drove givers to issue advocacy
ads and to make ``soft money'' donations to the parties. ``Those
are the results of never lifting those hard dollar limits,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the House used every plan they could
to defeat the Shays-Meehan legislation. While they failed to kill
the bill, they took solace in the fact that they had delayed its
passage until a week after the Senate left on its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate returns there is only a month left before
adjournment and a long list of spending bills that must be passed
to start the new fiscal year. ``There's no way this bill,
Shays-Meehan, will ever become law,'' said Doolittle. ``So we are
really laying the foundation now for the next Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the sponsors of the
Senate companion bill, has said that the brief time remaining makes
passing a Senate bill ``an exceedingly difficult task at best.''
And while Democrats say they will use parliamentary tactics to try
to attach the bill to other legislation, they are also looking for
ways to use the same tactic for other competing election-year
priorities such as regulating health maintenance organizations and
increasing the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the House at least, campaign finance overhaul proved
to be the bill that would not die.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to dispense with the issue in
March under a procedure that never allowed a vote on Shays-Meehan.
When that backfired, he tried to kill the measure through openness.
</P>
<P>
   In the usually tightly controlled House, the bill was pitted
against 10 competing measures and scores of amendments in a debate
that went on for weeks, usually at night. Shays said Thursday at
almost all of the amendments were written by aides to Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip, and to Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who has led the Senate battle against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But by last week, Shays and Meehan had managed to defeat all of
the amendments that they feared could fatally fracture their
coalition and on Monday their bill won majority support, keeping it
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The one last threat to the Shays-Meehan bill was another
bipartisan bill, drawn up by freshmen led by Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   It contained a less stringent ban on soft money that did not
apply to state parties and it did not put the same limits on issue
advocacy as the Shays-Meehan legislation.
</P>
<P>
   While Hutchinson said that this bill was preferable because it
could withstand a Supreme Court challenge, the supporters of
Shays-Meehan said that the bill would simply allow large,
unregulated contributions to be funneled through state parties.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that both DeLay and the Republican National
Committee had been working to persuade opponents of campaign
finance overhaul would vote for the freshman bill as a tactic for
defeating Shays-Meehan. But in the end, the freshman bill could not
command a majority and was defeated, 222-147.

   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

WAIT `TIL NEXT YEAR, GINGRICH ADMITS ON BIG TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded Thursday that huge
tax cuts would probably have to be put off to next year, but House
Republican leaders said they would forge ahead this fall with a
more modest tax cut in the belief that President Clinton would
ultimately accept it.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with fellow Republicans over the last week, Gingrich
has said Clinton will probably accept a bill cutting taxes by a
maximum of $70 billion to $80 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the speaker's decision can be seen as a retreat
in the face of opposition from Clinton and moderate Republicans.
Gingrich and other conservatives had been promoting legislation
that would cut taxes by $167 billion over five years and by $700
billion over 10 years. On the other hand, Republicans said, the
strategy could prove to be a big advance toward getting a tax cut
enacted into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans had made clear that they would not approve
tax cuts of the magnitude Gingrich originally wanted. And the White
House sounded cool even to the idea of a more modest tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday night, Gene Sperling, assistant to the
president for economic policy, said: ``The president is not going
to sign any new spending or tax initiative if it drains any of the
surplus that is reserved for Social Security, whether it's $700
billion, $70 billion or $7 billion. We believe that all of the
surplus should be reserved for Social Security until we have a
comprehensive bipartisan reform solution for that program.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, at a caucus of House Republicans, Gingrich said
Thursday, ``We believe the surplus money will go to save Social
Security and to provide tax relief.'' He vowed that ``every penny
of Social Security payroll taxes'' _ but not necessarily every
penny of the surplus _ ``will be used to strengthen Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office foresees a surplus of $63
billion this year and a total of $1.5 trillion in surpluses over
the next 10 years. In this fall's elections, Gingrich said,
Republicans will ask voters, ``Do you want the money to go back to
the American taxpayer, or do you want the money spent by
bureaucrats in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' top priority for this year's tax bill is
to reduce the effects of a longstanding quirk in the tax code known
as the marriage penalty. Because of this provision, many married
couples with two incomes pay higher taxes than they would if they
filed separate tax returns as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who writes tax legislation as
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: ``I look forward to
producing a middle-income tax cut bill in September, and I hope the
president will sign it. If he doesn't, he risks being known as the
president who imposed a marriage penalty on the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the House Republican caucus Thursday, Gingrich
listed five other priorities for tax-cutting legislation this fall
and next year. For example, he said, Republicans will try to cut
capital gains taxes, eliminate estate taxes and increase the tax
deductions allowed for the purchase of health insurance by
individuals and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate
and other assets. Gingrich wants to reduce the top tax rate on such
gains to 15 percent, from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the Republicans also would work to repeal a law
that reduces Social Security benefits for elderly people who earn
over $14,500 a year. Critics say the Social Security earnings limit
punishes people for working and forces some people to retire even
though they would prefer to work.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gingrich said the Republicans would try to repeal
provisions of the 1993 budget law that increased the taxation of
Social Security benefits for people with substantial income from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Thursday that he would accuse the Republicans
of weakening Social Security if they pursued a big tax cut financed
by projected surpluses in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House, Clinton
declared, ``We should reserve every penny of the surplus until we
save Social Security for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the federal budget was last balanced in 1969, he
said: ``We waited 29 years for this, to get out of the red ink. It
looks to me like we could at least wait a year and enjoy it and
take care of future generations' challenges before we run right out
and spend this money.''

   STAMFORD, CONN. _ Everyone, it seems, has an opinion about
Monica Lewinsky and the investigation led by Ken Starr into
allegations that she and President Clinton had some kind of sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a sampling of conversations at a strip mall in Stamford,
Conn., suggested recently, the spectrum of views is wide.
</P>
<P>
   There are some common themes, however. Almost no one believes
the President was not lying when he said on television last January
that he had not had sexual relations with ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is whether Starr should continue to
pursue him and threaten his very presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprisingly consistent degree, Americans are concerned
about the amount of money _ their money _ that has already been
spent on the probe, which at the last count had topped $40 million.
Even those who support the investigation balk at the cost of it.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Gentile, for example, who manages a local video shop, is
visceral in his distaste for the President. ``I think they should
throw his ass out of there, because he is a liar. I think he is
guilty,'' he vented angrily, before adding quickly: ``But I don't
think we should be paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, a local school teacher, also worries about the expense.
``I think they should stop this, because they're spending so much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same goes for Paula, a property manager in this East
Coast town located about one hour north of New York. ``I think they
should get on with the business of running the country, instead of
spending all this money on Clinton's sex life, '' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Both women, who preferred to withhold their family names, fall
firmly in the ``leave-the-man-alone'' camp. Like many others
interviewed, they said that whatever happened between Lewinsky and
the President is no one's affair but their own and Hillary
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in who slept with whom, I'm just not,''
said Mary, adding a view that seems to be most commonly shared by
women: ``It's really between Hillary and Bill. If Hillary can deal
with it, then so should the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender, however, does not appear to determine the way Americans
think about the scandal. Lucia Hoffman, intercepted renting videos
for her children who are off school for the summer, believes Starr
is right to pursue the President, who, she said, had ``used his
power to press himself on co-workers and women.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests the President needs professional help because he is
a ``sex addict.'' Mary also prescribes psychiatric treatment, but
for Starr, ``because he is obviously anal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a lot of Americans seem unable to settle in either
camp. Donald Winfield, who drives a truck for an electrical
contractor, believes that the President is a ``philanderer,'' who
has ``lied about this. And if the President has lied about that,
what else has he lied about in office?''
</P>
<P>
   Winfield believes the President should be ``punished.'' But
should he be impeached? ``Oh no,'' he answers quickly. ``I think
that would just bring shame on the country.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the chairman of the Senate judiciary
committee, a Republican, Orrin Hatch, appealed to President Clinton
to ``pour out his heart'' to the American people and held out the
prospect of mercy, he was not going out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   He made a point of saying that his counterpart in the House of
Representatives, Henry Hyde, would probably agree with him. So
would a large number, perhaps even a majority, of Republicans both
in Congress and in the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone schooled in British politics, such an overture from
the opposition to get an embattled leader off the hook seems almost
inconceivable, still less when it comes from the chairman of a
committee that would constitutionally be his judge in an
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the leader of the ruling party has painted himself into a
corner, now is surely the time to go in for the kill, not extend a
helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, there are reasons of principle
and practical politics, why that argument does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   While the President is nominated and campaigns on a party
ticket, he becomes on election both chief executive, trying to get
legislation of his choosing through Congress, but also head of
state, duty-bound to represent not just his party, but the country.
Getting rid of a President thus becomes a national rather than a
party political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an age notorious for popular cynicism towards politics,
politicians and (outside the Beltway) towards Washington and all
its works, Americans retain a respect _ even awe _ for the
institution of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Impeaching a president is not something to be undertaken
lightly, nor is it something that automatically generates popular
approval. Democrats as well as Republicans felt the loss after
Richard Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the United States might lose two presidents
by impeachment, or the threat of it, is widely seen as a national
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   What claim can the United States have to world leadership, even
to hold its head up internationally, if its leaders are judicially
and/or morally discredited?, is a view heard repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a pervasive sadness about Clinton's predicament
that makes even diehard Republicans want the allegations not to be
true; especially, they want him not to have lied.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is genuinely liked and respected _ for his engaging
manner, his political skills, even his principles. There is regret
that someone so prodigiously talented should have got himself in
such a mess.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans, it must be said, also have selfish
practical reasons for wanting Bill Clinton to complete his term,
and not only because they have reached a modus vivendi with him in
Congress that is to their benefit as well as his.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to leave office for what are in effect moral
reasons, the Republican Party could be deeply and openly split
between those who wanted to go easy on the President, and those of
the religious fundamentalist tendency that wanted a stronger moral
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Moral Majority would be back with a vengeance, and the
ensuing divisions would persist through this autumn's midterm
elections probably until the next presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign is the other reason why Republicans are keen to
keep Clinton in office. Should he resign, Vice-President Al Gore
would automatically become president for the remainder of Clinton's
term. There would not be an immediate election. That would give
Gore a head start for the next presidential campaign in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would prefer to see Democrats fielding an Al Gore
who campaigns poorly and carries the liability of a tarnished
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   They would then be able to unite against a Clinton legacy of
``sleaze'' and low morals and have a reasonable expectation of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   As incumbent, Al Gore would be that much more difficult to beat.
He might have learned how to campaign effectively and he might have
built up a political record of his own. (His wife, Tipper, is
already a formidable campaigner.)
</P>
<P>
   How far Republicans are motivated by considerations of high
principle as opposed to low pragmatism is open to question. But the
combination offers Clinton allies he sorely needs. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just days after a serious security flaw was
revealed in two popular electronic mail programs, an equally
troubling vulnerability has been discovered in Eudora, the most
widely used of all e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora flaw makes it possible for a malicious computer user
with little or no programming expertise to booby-trap an e-mail
message by inserting a seemingly harmless link to an Internet
location that in fact executes malignant code. This could permit an
attacker to destroy or steal data or to otherwise tamper with a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The security flaw was discovered early this week by a
Massachussets-based software company. There are no known instances
of anyone actually taking advantage of the weakness to send
damaging e-mail. The Qualcomm Corp., which makes Eudora, announced
Thursday that a repaired version of the software would be made
available on it Web site on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora's vulnerability is a consequence of the growing power of
e-mail software. Once used largely to send simple text messages,
new versions of electronic mail programs are increasingly
incorporating features that originated in browser programs for
using the World Wide Web. These features allow e-mail messages to
contain software code as well as text.
</P>
<P>
   The growing interconnectedness of most personal computers and
devices as diverse as laboratory equipment, cellular telephones and
cable set-top boxes raises the specter of increased vulnerability
for all these devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is a growing trade-off between convenience and
security,'' said Edward Felten, director of the Secure Internet
Programming Laboratory at Princeton University. ``By making it easy
to launch a program with a single click, you're also making it
possible to launch a dangerous program with a single click.''
</P>
<P>
   The flaw is found in Eudora versions 4.0 and 4.0.1 as well as in
4.1, a version being circulated in test form. Qualcomm is a San
Diego-based telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   In all, market researchers estimated Thursday that there are
more than 18 million copies of the commercial and free versions of
the Eudora program in use, only a small portion of which are
version 4.0 or 4.0.1. The security flaw is present in the Windows
version of Eudora, but not in the Macintosh version, which has
fewer features, enabling it to take advantage of Web-based
programming code from within an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora vulnerability is a direct descendant of the ancient
Trojan Horse deception in which a seemingly harmless item harbors
great danger. In the modern version, a malevolent program is masked
by a seemingly benign pointer known as a universal resource
locator, or URL, which is the fundamental underpinning of the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on a URL with a mouse button is supposed to take the
user to a page on the Web, but if this flaw was exploited, the user
could unknowingly launch a malicious program .
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancient Greeks knew a lot about this hazard,'' said Robert
Frankston, a veteran software developer and the co-inventor of the
software spreadsheet. ``Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora vulnerability is linked to the Internet Explorer
browser software that Microsoft integrated into the most recent
versions of its operating system, Windows 95 and Windows 98. As a
result Eudora programmers used the browser capability within the
operating system rather than coding their own.
</P>
<P>
   Security features in the Windows browser can be set to filter
out dangerous or forbidden commands coming in from the Internet,
like orders to format a hard drive or insert code into an existing
file. But because Windows assumes that anything already on your
computer's hard drive is in a ``safe zone,'' its browser opens and
closes local files and runs most kinds of local code without such
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   This underscores a basic weakness in the security of personal
computers that are connected to today's computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora flaw came to light just a little more than a week
after security researchers announced a similar problem in versions
of Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs and in
Netscape's Mail program. In that case, a group of researchers in
Finland discovered in late June that it was possible for an
attacker to exploit a programming error to force the mail program
to crash and then run a malicious program in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, both Microsoft and Netscape quickly developed fixes,
which can be obtained by contacting the companies' Web sites.
Thursday, Microsoft began notifying registered users of its
software about the problem via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora vulnerability was brought to light earlier this week
by Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a Cambridge,
Mass.-based maker of operating system software and products for
Microsoft's MS-DOS, the operating system that predated Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the software that Phar Lap sells is designed to
run in small devices that are increasingly connected to the
Internet, Smith said that he had grown increasingly cautious about
the risks of software transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the flaws in the Microsoft and Netscape e-mail
programs, Smith began examining the security of Eudora, the mail
program he used.
</P>
<P>
   He soon discovered that it was possible to attach a program to a
mail message and then use the Javascript programming language to
mask the identity of the illicit program, thereby tricking the
recipient of the electronic mail message into inadvertently
starting the program by clicking on the URL.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Java programming language created by software designers
at Sun Microsystems Inc. and the Javascript language created by
designers at the Netscape Communications Corp. are attempts to
develop programming languages that incorporate special security for
Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   After contacting both Microsoft and Qualcomm to alert them to
the problem, Smith said, he determined that the problem lay in the
way the Qualcomm mail program interacted with the Javascript
programming language, permitting the URL to point to and run a
local program rather than pointing to a Web page as the user
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to have both security and convenience for our
users,'' said Matthew Parks, Qualcomm's Eudora product line
manager. ``The real challenge is for people like us, who are
developing these programs so users don't have to worry about these
things.''

MICROSOFT TOLD TO SURRENDER CODE FOR WINDOWS 95, 98 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over strong objections from Microsoft Corp., a
federal judge ordered the company Thursday to turn over to the
government the source code for its operating system and to make its
chairman, Bill Gates, and 16 other executives available for
pretrial depositions that will last as long the Justice Department
deems necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was ordered to give Justice Department lawyers
preparing for a Sept. 8 trial in the government's antitrust suit a
copy of the source code for the latest two versions of its
operating system, Windows 95 and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had asked that Gates' testimony be limited to eight
hours, and had wanted to provide only seven other executives for
pretrial interviews. The company had offered to turn over the
source code _ the dense technical blueprint _ of the operating
system under conditions that would have made it difficult for the
government to bring in outside experts to analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hearing called to settle these and other disputes
Thursday afternoon, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court ruled in favor of the government on every question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to put a time restraint on the length of time
Gates may be deposed,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered that the deposition be taken beginning Aug. 12, four
weeks before the scheduled opening of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Microsoft gave the source code for Windows 95, the
operating system version that was replaced this spring by Windows
98, to 20 state attorneys general. They have also filed an
anti-trust suit against the company. In that case, the attorneys
general agreed to Microsoft's request that no one who looked at the
code would be allowed to work for most major software companies
during the following 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   When Justice Department lawyers entered their own request for
the Windows 95 and and Windows 98 code, they argued that the
government ``will be unable to utilize the services of their
consultants or experts'' under such a restriction ``unless they are
willing to give up their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the judge agreed but told Microsoft that he would
order severe penalties if any of the government's consultants
misused the data.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the source code for Windows 95 and Windows
98 to help prove its assertion that Microsoft is improperly
bundling its browser, the software used to navigate the World Wide
Web, with its operating system. The Justice Department argues that
bundling the browser was a tactic intended to harm Microsoft's
primary competitor in that business, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that the company's leaders were planning to
include browser capabilities in Windows as early as April 1994 _
long before Netscape had grown to be an important player in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, the Justice Department vigorously disputes
that notion. One brief, filed last November, quoted from numerous
internal Microsoft documents indicating that as late as 1996, the
company had made no decision to bundle the browser with Windows.
This was well after Netscape had grown to dominate the browser
market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government quotes from 1994 e-mail messages to and from
Steven Sinofsky, who was technical assistant to Gates, in which
Sinofsky says the company has made no decision to integrate Web
browsing software with Windows. Instead, one June 1994 message from
him says, ``What we should be doing is getting as many third
parties writing Internet things on top of'' Windows ``as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another internal electronic message in December 1996, Jim
Allchin, another Microsoft executive, is quoted as urging others
within the company to begin bundling the company's Web browser,
Internet Explorer, with Windows. ``My conclusion is we must
leverage Windows more,'' he wrote. Otherwise, ``I don't understand
how IE is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should think about an integrated solution,'' Allchin wrote.
``That is our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Microsoft employees and executives quoted in the
Justice Department brief have since filed declarations with the
court saying that their earlier e-mail messages were being
misinterpreted or taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sinofsky asserted that he wrote those
tentative-sounding messages only because not everyone within the
company had been told that the leaders had decided to bundle a
browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, a Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, said that
the company would file a petition next Monday asking Jackson to
dismiss important parts of the antitrust case _ primarily the part
dealing with bundling the browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly are entitled to do that,'' Jackson said. But he
indicated that he probably would not approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said its motion would be framed by a federal Appeals
Court ruling in June that struck down an earlier preliminary
injunction issued by Jackson, requiring Microsoft to offer Windows
without its browser.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court said the injunction had been ordered before
the District Court had gathered enough evidence to support it. This
time, the judge told Warden, ``I am going to be finding facts
here'' _ that is, gathering evidence during the trial. With that,
the judge appeared to be saying that he did not think the Appeals
Court ruling had much direct bearing on the current case.

MOTHER CHARGED WITH MURDER DECADES AFTER CHILDRENS' DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Endless tragedy had cast Marie Noe as a martyr,
the cheated mother who had endured the death of 10 sons and
daughters, one by one. It was a fate almost too cruel to be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday Assistant District Attorney Jay Feinschi argued
that Mrs. Noe was, instead, ``as much a mass murderer as Ted
Bundy'' and said that the court should show her no mercy. Mrs. Noe,
69, who was accused this week of murdering eight of her infant
children from 1949 to 1968, was denied bail.
</P>
<P>
   Life Magazine featured the woman who lives on North American
Street and her millworker husband, Arthur, as emblems of tragedy in
1963, after six of their children had died. The first baby was
stillborn. The second died hours after birth at the hospital. The
other eight infants went home healthy, but none lived longer than
14 months. Most of the mysteries were eventually attributed to crib
death, now called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
</P>
<P>
   ``This case involves a great American tragedy,'' District
Attorney Lynne Abraham said. Ms. Abraham said Mrs. Noe had
confessed to the police to killing four of the children, and had
told police she could not recall the circumstances of the other
deaths. Her husband, 77, was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had suspected foul play for years, but had not found
proof, said Halbert Fillinger, the coroner of Montgomery County,
who worked in the Philadelphia medical examiner's office in the
1960s and helped conduct autopsies on some of the Noe babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One SIDS death is a tragedy,'' he said. ``Two is a mystery.
Three is murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said the eight children had been smothered with a
pillow or another soft object. The state cannot seek the death
penalty because the deaths happened before states were permitted to
resume imposing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Noes had taken out nominal life insurance
policies on some of the children, but that was not seen as a motive
for the killings. Ms. Abraham said evidence of a motive would be
shown at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said that when each of the eight children died, Mrs.
Noe was alone at home with the child. She said Mrs. Noe would
sometimes call a neighbor for help, saying, ``Something's wrong
with the baby.'' Each of the children was pronounced dead on
arrival at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Perlman, a pediatrician who treated one of the Noe
children, Constance, in 1958, had run extensive tests on the
newborn because of the earlier unexplained deaths and found nothing
abnormal, a police affidavit in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   When Perlman told Mrs. Noe that she had a beautiful child,
according to the police affidavit, Mrs. Noe replied, ``She's not
going to live . . . just like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Noe's old working-class neighborhood of row houses in the
Kensington section, most people interviewed expressed shock over
the charges. In the living room of the Noe's home, two doors away
from the row house where they lived when the children died, is a
framed photograph of one of their children, Catherine Ellen, a
10-week old who died in February 1966.
</P>
<P>
   David Rudenstein, a lawyer for Mrs. Noe, told reporters on
Wednesday that police had coerced the statement by grilling Mrs.
Noe, who is diabetic and was not feeling well, throughout the night
for a total of 11 hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am appalled at the way this case has been handled,'' said
Rudenstein, who said that Mrs. Noe had told police she wanted to
call a lawyer, but that they ignored her. ``They intimated that if
you sign this, you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he found it ``inconceivable'' that Mrs. Noe would
keep the killings a secret for nearly a half-century, then suddenly
acknowledge committing murder to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstein also accused the district attorney's office of
looking for ``a big splash of a case.'' He indicated that Mrs. Noe
would plead not guilty at her preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsies of the Noe children were studied by Dr. Stephen
Ludwig, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in
Philadelphia, who concluded that the deaths were caused by
suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said medical authorities in the 1950s and 1960s were
reluctant to make accusations against parents in cases of crib
death. But he said that the ``medical community has now
acknowledged that one of the provable explanations for SIDS is
really infanticide,'' the police affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said the case was ``a wake-up call'' to police
officers and health workers to be vigilant in such cases. She said
several factors had prompted her to pursue the investigation,
including the book, The Death of Innocents, published in 1997,
which examined the case of a New York State woman convicted of
murder in 1994 for killing her five children two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Noe children all died at home. When questioned after
the death of a seven-month-old daughter, Mary Lee, in 1963, Mrs.
Noe told police that she had left the baby in the crib for a few
minutes and returned to find the child ``gasping for breath and
turning blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Noe, who worked in textile mills and later became a
Democratic committeeman, told the Philadelphia Daily News, in an
article published in January, that he was still burdened by the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to see is this thing brought up
again,'' he said. ``It brings up all the pain and troubles and
heartaches. Maybe it's news to others, but it's pain to us.'' &QL;

HOW TO GET AROUND PROBLEM IN EUDORA E-MAIL PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are relatively easy ways to avoid the recently discovered
security flaw in Eudora, the world's most popular electronic mail
program, but the quick fixes should not obscure the need for
caution when reading unsolicited e-mail messages, Internet experts
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, which could allow malicious programmers to mask
harmful programs as simple links to the World Wide Web, affects
only the 4.0 and 4.0.1 versions of Eudora running on computers that
use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 or 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   People who use Eudora on a Macintosh are not vulnerable. Windows
users can find out which version of Eudora they own by choosing the
``About Eudora'' option under the program's ``Help'' menu.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Qualcomm, which makes Eudora, would not say how
many thousands of people have bought the 4.0 and 4.0.1 versions of
the program since they were introduced last December. But by this
afternoon on the East Coast, Qualcomm plans to post a free software
``patch'' at www.qualcomm.com/eudora on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A patch is a small program that changes the code inside another,
larger program. Users who run the patch will be able to fix their
copies of Eudora so they are no longer vulnerable to the security
problem.
</P>
<P>
   People who like the latest software can also download a
``beta,'' or test, copy of the next version of Eudora, version 4.1,
from the same Web address. Qualcomm executives said version 4.1 did
not contain the security flaw.
</P>
<P>
   People who are unable or unwilling to download new software from
the Web can alter their current versions of Eudora so the security
flaw can no longer affect their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora uses portions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software
to view e-mail messages that can look as polished as Web pages. By
severing Eudora's relationship with Internet Explorer, the security
problem can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, users must select ``Options'' under Eudora's
``Tools'' menu. Under the category of ``Viewing Mail,'' the user
must turn off the option ``Use Microsoft's Viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that by disabling the Microsoft component, users
can no longer view e-mail that contains complex formats from the
Web, including tables and charts.
</P>
<P>
   But by fixing the security problem in Eudora, users are assuring
only that programs that are attached to incoming messages reveal
themselves as icons that can be clicked on like any other.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs can still be destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attachments have always been dangerous,'' said the programmer
who discovered the problem, Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap
Software Inc., which is based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sending stuff down the wire, and it could have bad
stuff in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said people should be wary about opening attachments that
come with unsolicited electronic messages.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Parks, Qualcomm's product manager for Eudora, said:
``People with e-mail in general need to be careful with
attachments. People should be aware of who is sending them
information.''

REPUBLICANS AREN'T ANXIOUS TO OPEN IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ark., Ga., Pa., Calif., Mo., Okla., Wyo.)   (With CLINTON-STARR and CLINTON-LEWINSKY)  
(lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Monica Lewinsky testifying before a grand jury
at the federal courthouse, Republicans a few blocks away on Capitol
Hill were sensing the gravity of the task that might well await
them.
</P>
<P>
   They may have to investigate whether President Clinton lied
under oath or otherwise obstructed justice in covering up any
sexual involvement with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The House, where Republicans hold a 229-205 advantage, would
conduct any congressional investigation and initiate any
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every member has to be reflecting in his own mind, `Is this a
question we have to resolve?''' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind.
``As evidence is developed in the grand jury, we have to take that
very seriously. But it's not a good assignment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most House Republicans, McIntosh has little use for Clinton
or his policies. But he and many others still said they wished the
matter would vanish. He said he gave the president the benefit of
the doubt at the moment and that any impeachment proceedings would
undermine the stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with scores of Republican House members, most
expressed no desire for the task that may loom ahead, possibly as
soon as a week or two after they return from their summer vacation
in September. The distaste is both personal and political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that something is coming in our direction,''
said Rep. Asa Hutchison, R-Ark. ``I don't think we want to receive
it, but it's a duty that we have to deal with it when it comes, not
at a politically convenient time.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one member, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., expressed an urgency for
a report from the independent counsel and for the House to get an
investigation underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that the inquiry into impeachment was justified back in
November, and there's nothing that has changed my opinion,'' he
said. ``I think it's even more appropriate today,'' he said.
``There seems certainly to be a fairly substantial body of evidence
that's being developed that perjury has been committed, that
subornation of perjury has been committed, there's a further
pattern of obstruction of justice _ none of that did we know about
back in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said it was important that the House investigate the
questions surrounding President Clinton's behavior. ``If we let
them slide, we're telling the rest of the world that it doesn't
matter to us that we have a president who, from all appearances,
can't be trusted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less eager, saying they could do little until
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, issues his report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to focus on it, I don't really care about it,''
said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa. He said he expected to have to
``engage'' in mid-September _ a time when Congress will also be in
the midst of tough negotiations with the Clinton administration
over the 13 spending bills that must be passed and signed to keep
the government running in the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have a life of its own beyond anything I can say
or do about it,'' Weldon said, ``so it's just not worth me getting
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., was equally dismissive. ``That's a
different planet,'' he said of the Lewinsky matter after talking to
reporters at length about health care. ``It doesn't affect anything
I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans said they could not help but think about
the political ramifications of and any House action. Some said they
worried that if Republicans went after Clinton on sexual matters,
the Democrats would do the same thing to them.

   ``The War Room will be cranked up to a brand new height,'' said
one Republican lawmaker, referring to Clinton's political team.
``They'll all be working overtime.'' Said an aide to another
Republican: ``If they go after him on that, it will be no holds
barred.''

<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said Republicans had to be careful
to center any investigation on legal questions of perjury and ``not
violating President and Mrs. Clinton's privacy.'' She said that
women she talked with ``are very sensitive to Hillary and Chelsea
as being so vulnerable _ they identify with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many seemed particularly concerned about the timing of Starr's
report to the House. The Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, addressed that issue Thursday, saying that sending it to
Congress before the November elections would be ``very partisan,
very unfair and very demeaning to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican from the Northeast, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he believed that party leaders wanted the report to
leak out before the elections but would not force the rank-and-file
to cast any difficult votes on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing our guys want to do is pick up seats in
November,'' he said. ``That's all this is about.'' The idea, he
said, would be for damaging bits leak out before the elections so
that Democratic voters are ``so discouraged or turned off that they
don't go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think that because of that very potential for
partisanship, the report should be held off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't even talk about this until after the
election,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. He said that injecting a
House investigation into the fall campaigns would bring out ``the
dishonesty'' in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that voters are going to lose even more confidence in
the political process because the politicians are going to
politicize it and demagogue it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barbara Cubin, R-Wyo., said the political process was
already damaged because the Lewinsky matter was dominating all news
from Washington. Having to deal with it head on before the election
``can't be good for the country,'' she said, ``but what's happening
now is not good for the country.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American public has not yet heard the voice of
the young woman whose appearance at a federal courthouse Thursday
morning drew a dozen satellite trucks and scores of reporters who
mostly wound up interviewing each other about their brief glimpse
of her.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Lewinsky has plenty to say, according to several
people she has spent time with since the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, began investigating her relationship with the
president more than six months ago. Sometimes, they say, she yells
at the televised image of her former friend and Pentagon colleague,
Linda Tripp, who after taping hours of her late-night confidences
is at the very top of her enemies list.
</P>
<P>
   Also prominently featured there is her former lawyer, William
Ginsburg, who sometimes embarrassed her with his public comments.
Another friend said she regrets having posed for a seductive Vanity
Fair photo spread and blames Ginsburg for pushing her to do it.
Neither, of course, was she thrilled with his comments to reporters
that she would ``tend to embellish.'' In the end it was Ms.
Lewinsky herself who made the decision to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, is apparently not counted as an
adversary. One friend said, ``It's pretty obvious she cared about
this man, and it's also pretty obvious he cared about her. Somebody
doesn't get that kind of access to the White House if they're not
wanted.'' Now, the friend said, she has ``mixed feelings'' of hurt
along with respect. Clinton has denied he had any sexual
relationship with her, and some of his supporters have suggested
she only fantasized a liaison with him.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Ms. Lewinsky's friends talked, none for attribution,
about her isolated existence, holed up in the Watergate apartment
she shares with her mother, Marcia Lewis. They said she worries
about the future. Sometimes she has trouble sleeping. And she has
been hurt by former acquaintances who exploited their friendship.
On occasion, they said, she breaks down and cries for her
interrupted life.
</P>
<P>
   But they also said she has never seen herself as anyone's
victim, and described her as a savvy and self-confident woman
worlds tougher than she has been portrayed. Just turned 25, the
one-time White House intern has the steel to wade through a press
gaggle without ever dropping her smile. And she is game enough to
sneak out in a wig and sunglasses in return for the freedom of a
run through Washington's Rock Creek Park.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest misconception about Ms. Lewinsky in her own
mind, friends said, is the notion that she is enjoying any of the
circus that has surrounded her since allegations of an affair with
the President first broke in January.
</P>
<P>
   To fill her days in Washington, where she has few friends and
has largely stayed confined to her apartment, she walks on a
treadmill, reads voraciously and knits an endless series of
scarves. She favors romance and mystery novels, including ``Point
of Origin'' by Patricia Cornwell, whose work chronicles the
exploits of a medical examiner who has had a tumultuous affair with
a married official in the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also reads several newspapers regularly and watches
a massive amount of television, mostly news shows obsessed with her
case, though her mother has tried to get her to stop watching.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't dare to use the in-house gym in the Watergate, and
sends others out to pick up anything she needs to avoid setting off
a press frenzy. When her mother, who is her closest confidante,
recently married a New York businessman, R. Peter Straus, at a tiny
ceremony in New York, Ms. Lewinsky did not feel she should attend
because of the attention she might draw.
</P>
<P>
   She is afraid to call friends because she believes her phone is
tapped _ especially since a couple of those she has called soon
found themselves talking to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But she has had some lighter moments, too, particularly in Los
Angeles, where the press has been less attentive. She spent much of
the summer on the West Coast, living with her father, a radiation
oncologist in Beverly Hills, and her younger brother, a student at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. And in Los Angeles, she
was able to resume some semblance of a normal life, going shopping,
catching a few movies, and relaxing at a family friend's pool.
Sometimes, she makes dark jokes about her predicament.
</P>
<P>
   And on occasion, she even allows herself to speak about the
future, and her old dream of attending graduate school in
psychology or social sciences. At a small dinner two weeks ago at a
restaurant in Brentwood, where her father lives, she said that for
her 25th birthday, what she wanted most was to get her life back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when she is not in disguise, strangers sometimes feel
free to give her a hug and a few words of encouragement. Others
apparently cannot quite believe she exists outside the television
world in which she is endlessly shown going through revolving doors
and getting in and out of cars. At a Los Angeles clothing store
recently, a shopper approached her and said, ``I'll bet people tell
you all the time you look just like Monica Lewinsky.'' Said her
companion, ``You know, they do.''

 &HT;    Gingrich leads trip for peace in Ireland
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich will lead a 28-person
contingent of House members, spouses and staff on a taxpayer-funded
trip to Ireland today that will focus on the peace process in
Northern Ireland _ and, to a lesser extent, the speaker's roots.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Gingrich's controversial trip to Israel in the
spring, when he criticized Clinton administration policy in the
Middle East, Gingrich's Ireland visit will lend support to the
president, who helped broker an agreement between Catholic and
Protestant groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is the U.S. legislative leadership supports the
process 100 percent,'' said Rep. James Walsh (R-N.Y.), one of seven
House members who will make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to visit Ireland next month. His 1995 trip
to British-ruled Northern Ireland was a symbolic boost to efforts
to end the sectarian violence there.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's weeklong visit includes two days in Belfast, where he
will meet with leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, and other Catholic and Protestant leaders.
``That is clearly the most important aspect of the trip,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker appeared at a hastily arranged performance by cast
members of the Irish revue ``Riverdance'' outside the Capitol on
Thursday. He declined requests to show off his dance steps, but
reaffirmed his support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   While in Belfast, the delegation is expected to work on two
houses being built by Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's first visit to Ireland also will take him to Donegal,
where the speaker will try to trace his maternal ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule leaves ample room for sightseeing, including a tour
of Trinity College in Dublin and a visit to Kilkenny Castle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the members, six of whom will be accompanied by
their spouses, three Gingrich staffers, three other congressional
staffers, five military aides, House Sergeant-at-Arms Bill
Livingood, House Parliamentarian Charles Johnson, a security
officer and a Navy physician also will make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman and a member of the
traveling party, said Livingood is accompanying the speaker for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the third-ranking constitutional officer of the United
States travels outside the country, security is always an issue,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's usual complement of plainclothes Capitol Police
officers is prohibited by law from making international trips.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, the group will use a government plane and have
U.S. diplomats at their disposal

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee voted along party lines Thursday
to charge Attorney General Janet Reno with contempt of Congress,
transforming into a criminal case the battle over whether an
independent counsel should be appointed to investigate and
prosecute campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Reno's refusal to give the committee reports on the
issue from the top Justice Department investigators: FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, former chief of the department's
task force on campaign finance. They testified Tuesday that their
memorandums argued that the law required Reno to ask a special
court to name an independent counsel in the investigation of
Democratic fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans on the committee, the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight, have demanded that Reno seek an
independent counsel, but she has adamantly and repeatedly declined
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, in a decision that was not publicly disclosed,
Reno ordered a formal 30-day review of what government officials
described as a previously unexamined campaign finance issue that
could ultimately lead the attorney general to refer the tangle of
political finance issues to an independent prosecutor. The
officials would not disclose the nature of the accusations under
review or the identity of the subject of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Reno's decision seemed at odds with her public
refusal _ reiterated Thursday _ to seek an independent prosecutor
and her willingness to battle Congress in an effort to keep
lawmakers from obtaining the investigative memos.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view in the Capitol on Thursday was that an
accommodation would be reached and that the contempt issue would be
resolved before it reached prosecution. Congress often threatens
contempt proceedings, but no top government official has ever been
prosecuted on such a charge. Compromises have always been found
first.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday _ with 24 Republicans in favor of contempt and
18 Democrats and Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an Independent,
opposed _ came at the end of a four-hour meeting infected with
partisan acrimony and personal animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe that the attorney general is not following the
law, then we have a responsibility to find out why,'' declared Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's top Democrat, Henry Waxman of California,
accused Burton of a ``blatant strong-arm tactic'' and said that his
request for the investigators' memorandums was ``ludicrous on the
merits.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the vote, Reno accused the committee
of tampering politically with a criminal investigation. She gave no
indication that she would ever comply with the subpoena for the
memorandums.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives will not take up the matter until
after a four-week recess that begins Friday. If a majority of the
House votes for contempt, the matter will go to the Justice
Department for prosecution. Under an 1857 law, refusal to cooperate
with a congressional committee is punishable by up to one year in
prison and a fine of up to $1,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House committees have voted twice to cite Cabinet officers for
contempt for refusing to turn over documents. But these cases _
involving Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1975 and Interior
Secretary James Watt in 1982 _ were dropped after compromises were
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The full House voted to charge Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford with contempt in 1983, but this
case was also dropped before prosecution after lawmakers were given
access to the documents they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has made clear that he would withdraw the subpoena for
the Freeh and La Bella memorandums if Reno asked for an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Burton committee appears to be on solid legal ground. Courts
have ruled repeatedly over the years that Executive Branch must
comply with congressional subpoenas unless the committee issuing
the subpoena lacks jurisdiction or the president asserts executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, there is no question of jurisdiction, and no claim
of executive privilege has been brought.
</P>
<P>
   But the wisdom of the subpoena and the contempt citation is
another matter. At her news conference Thursday, Reno said that
important principles were at stake. ``The department cannot do its
duty if it is subjected to a process that can only shake public
confidence in our ability to make law-enforcement decisions free of
political pressure,'' she asserted. ``And it cannot perform the way
it should if required to submit internal memoranda to political
scrutiny in a manner that can only squelch candid, honest, open
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Freeh and La Bella pleaded with the committee not to
demand access to their memorandums. Release of the documents, La
Bella said, would be ``devastating to the investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman played a videotape Thursday of that portion of the Freeh
and La Bella testimony. ``They're telling us that releasing the La
Bella memo would provide a road map to their case,'' Waxman said,
``and the chairman pays no attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burton was unswayed. He said: ``I understand their concerns.
I know why they fell that way. Under normal circumstances, we would
not have subpoenaed them. But these are not normal circumstances.
We have a reasonable basis for believing that the attorney general
isn't upholding the law, and we have an obligation under the
Constitution to find out if that is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton insisted that ``the documents are not for public
consumption'' and that the committee would would be careful to keep
them confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said all along that she had not ruled out seeking an
independent counsel and would so if she received compelling new
evidence. In her recent statements, she has left a vague impression
that the La Bella memorandum, given to her July 16, might give her
the opportunity to reconsider her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she asked for three weeks to review La Bella's
document, 94 pages with a foot-thick stack of exhibits attached.
After that, she told Burton, she would brief him privately on the
contents of the memorandum and testify publicly if he wished.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not satisfied. He said: ``The August recess is coming
up, and we'll be rushing to finish up in September. I'm not
inclined to leave this matter unresolved. At any rate, the attorney
general has given no indication that she is willing to be any more
forthcoming in September than she is today.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the contempt vote Thursday reflected the frustration of
Burton and his fellow Republicans over the obstacles they have
faced in their campaign finance investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been less than fully cooperative.
More than 100 witnesses have fled the country or asserted their
Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. And
just last month, there were indications that Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., had access to the Freeh memorandum that was being withheld
from Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois expressed these frustrations.
``This committee has been shut out,'' he declared. ``Day in and day
out, week in and week out, month in and month out, year in and year
out. It's time to change the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona, a former prosecutor, accused Reno
of ``prosecutorial malpractice'' and ``incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats maintained that the investigation had been
crippled by the partisan spirit in which Burton and his committee
operated. ``The whole thing is about embarrassing the attorney
general,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin. ``It's not about
justice. It's not about the seeking of truth.''

MEXICO'S DEBATE ON BANKS GETS NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A six-month discussion about Mexico's $62 billion
bank bailout has suddenly turned into a national brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians are accusing pro-government businessmen
of enriching themselves at public expense, while government
officials are warning that the debate is degenerating into a witch
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began when President Ernesto Zedillo proposed that
vast debts from the government's rescue be assumed by the Mexican
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The widening confrontation of recent days led to opposition
demands for an investigation into the financing of Zedillo's 1994
campaign as well as to threats of lawsuits by wealthy bankers who
say they have been unjustly accused of financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are calling the debate a watershed in Mexico's
political life.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time powerful forces, including the opposition
parties in control of the lower house of Congress, are demanding a
thorough airing of the cozy dealings between government officials
and the circle of wealthy industrialists and bankers who finance
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The latest battles flared on Monday, when the leftist Party of
the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, made public a list of 310
people, including several billionaires, characterizing them as
beneficiaries of the bank rescue that followed the 1994 peso
devaluation, though the party acknowledged that in many cases its
information was sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the PRD president, said the party
pieced the list together from people in the banking and business
worlds after the government cited bank secrecy laws for refusing to
provide details of the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asking for information, bank by bank and file by
file, but the executive has refused,'' Lopez Obrador said at a news
conference. ``If this was a matter between two private parties,
where one owes and the other is trying to collect, we wouldn't care
about knowing secrets. But any attempt to make the debt of a
handful of private people public makes full information
indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the government contends that the bailout was aimed
at supporting ordinary depositors by saving the banks, but it
acknowledges that the banks cannot collect some very large loans
made to wealthy people, some of them bankers themselves, on the
basis of their reputations, and without collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD's defiant action has provoked angry criticism from the
government and its supporters.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials at the bank rescue program, the Fund for Bank Savings
Protection, immediately attacked the PRD list as inaccurate and
sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This list does not agree with the information that exists in
our databases,'' the fund said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's spokesman, Marco Provencio, said at a
news conference that the PRD's tactics were similar to Sen. Joseph
McCarthy's demagogic use of a list of supposed Communists in
Washington in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Bankers Association published full-page
advertisements in newspapers, expressing concern about the
``radicalization of positions,'' and the PRI issued a statement
calling publication of the list ``political impertinence.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the showdown is the government's argument that while
it wants to inform the Congress fully about the bank rescue, and
has already made available 8,000 pages of documentation, it cannot
share the names of people whose unpaid loans have been assumed by
the fund. Mexico's bank secrecy laws prohibit such identification,
the government says.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has a history of enormous flexibility in
interpreting, and reinterpreting, statutes in ways convenient for
the PRI and its supporters. Given that, opposition leaders and some
independent analysts have characterized the government's legal
arguments as tactics to protect inappropriate transactions from
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the tight alliance between the government and the
economic elite permitted that the most powerful industrial groups
could do almost whatever they wanted, as long as they did it within
a framework of support for the official party,'' Jonathan Heath, a
prominent private economist, wrote in a newspaper column on
Thursday. ``The publication of the list by the PRD, despite its
inaccuracies, has broken that taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the debate has begun to challenge longstanding relations
between government officials and wealthy supporters, ``it is
marking a watershed in our political system,'' Heath said.

EXPOS COMPLETE SWEEP OF DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Dodgers' season did not end Thursday afternoon
with a 9-0 loss to the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   It might have ended two days earlier when they blew a four-run
lead in the eighth inning and lost in 10.
</P>
<P>
   There are games every year that players remember as the turning
point, a yardstick that can be used to measure greatness or to wrap
a team across the knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros wasn't about to say getting swept in three games by
the lowly Expos was the Dodgers' last stand. He knows the wild-card
race means never having to say you're lousy.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembered a bad game last season that seemed to have a
haunting ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in Texas, where we had a 12-7 lead in the ninth and
lost,'' said Karros, remembering when the Dodgers were beaten 13-12
by the Rangers. ``The routs aren't as bad as the ones you let get
away. People point to the Giants series (a sweep Sept. 17-18), but
we just never were the same after that loss in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros said the 1997 Dodgers, who finished two games behind San
Francisco in the West, didn't know they were doomed at the time,
just as it might be a week or two before they can assess the damage
of this series with the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disappointing performance, the Dodgers' 4-6 trip
cost them only one game to the wild-card leading Chicago Cubs in
the 10 days. Getting whacked by nine runs to a team 30 games out of
first place puts them six games behind the idle Cubs with 47 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And though they face the mighty Braves next weekend, the
Dodgers' next six games are against two of the league's worst
teams, Pittsburgh and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you're a kid and you get your butt whipped,''
second baseman Eric Young said. ``You're supposed to learn
something from it. We'll see what we've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield returns from his three-game suspension tonight
against the Pirates. Sheffield and Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall
were involved in a June 28 brawl that led to the suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, sidelined Thursday with more lower back pain, will
be examined today and is not expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think once we get Mondesi and Sheffield back, we'll be
OK,'' said Karros, who made outs to end three innings after doing
it four times Wednesday night. ``And if you look at the wild card,
I still think we are in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last three games also looked very similar to 1991, when
the Dodgers were swept in four games at Olympic Stadium to begin
the second half. The Braves were in third place at the time, but
they picked up four games in the standings and wound up winning the
National League West on the next-to-last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 11,791 on Thursday, the Dodgers were shut down by
right-hander Jeremy Powell (1-1), who was making only his third
major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a first-inning single by Trenidad Hubbard and a
sixth-inning base hit by Young, the Dodgers hopped on the team
plane a couple hours early.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, on the other hand, have gone 7-4 in their past 11
games _ against San Diego, San Francisco and the Dodgers, the three
top teams in the West.
</P>
<P>
   And they have done it without center fielder Rondell White, who
went on the disabled list July 21 with a fractured right ring
finger. White's replacement, Terry Jones, went 2 for 4 Thursday
with a three-run double off Darren Hall that broke the game open in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the expectations are different here than they are with
the Dodgers,'' said Expos first baseman Ryan McGuire, a product of
El Camino Real High and UCLA. ``But this is a place for
opportunity. Rondell went down and Vladimir Guerrero (NL Player of
the Month) had an incredible July. Then we had the big trade. But
we don't get down, we just keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire was referring to last Friday's seven-player swap that
sent left-hander Carlos Perez and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to
the Dodgers for Wilton Guerrero and three prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Perez (7-11) started Thursday against his former team and said
he was very nervous after pitching seven scoreless innings against
the Mets last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the fourth, Perez allowed a two-run double to
catcher Bob Henley, who played at Double-A in 1997 before a
concussion ended his season. Mike Mordecai, once a promising
infielder with the Braves, followed with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it is done here,'' said Grudzielanek, who went 2
for 13 in the series. ``They play well against the good teams up
here. You always wanted to prove yourself against the Dodgers and
the Braves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEASIDE, Calif. _ Nestled alongside this small town on the
Monterey Peninsula is the old Fort Ord, a sprawling Army post on
the Pacific Ocean, once home to 36,000 people but rendered obsolete
by the round of military base closings several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the community has scarcely one-tenth of its former
population, and when people who work nearby return every night to
Spartan homes among abandoned buildings, the streets are so quiet
that even a soft breeze makes a racket.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is quieter than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two months, 13-year-old Christina Marie Williams has
been missing. The youngest in a family of five that lives in a
house on a sleepy cul-de-sac, Christina took her dog, Greg, for a
walk in the neighborhood on the evening of June 12. About a
half-hour later, Greg wandered back alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, witnesses reported seeing two men in an
old sedan lurking in the area before and after Christina and the
dog went walking. One woman told the authorities she saw a girl who
matched Christina's description sitting in the car, looking
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Those sightings, unusual for a kidnapping case, enabled the
federal authorities to develop sketches of the men and the car they
were driving. But in the seven weeks since Christina disappeared,
the drawings remain all they have to go on. That, and fervent
prayers that Northern California does not have another Polly Klaas
case on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're stuck in a bad `Twilight Zone' episode,''
Christina's father, Michael Williams, said Tuesday, describing
anxious weeks when only fitful sleep brings any relief for him, his
wife, Alice, and their two other children, Jennifer, 18, and
Michael, 16. ``You can't get out. There's no resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams family is hardly alone in its anguish. A recent
study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a
nonprofit organization whose headquarters are in Arlington, Va.,
found that among the nearly 1 million people reported missing last
year were 200 to 300 children who were kidnapped by a stranger.
Ernie Allen, the center's president, said that about two-thirds of
the children were girls 18 or younger, and that half of those
kidnapped were found slain. The others, he said, returned safely or
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 41, is a Navy meteorologist for the Defense Department
who moved his family here last winter after 12 years in Japan and
the Philippines. He has not returned to work since Christina
vanished. His wife finally went back to her job as a housekeeper at
the local Hyatt Regency Hotel this week, just to get her mind off
things for a few hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their home on Nijmegen Street has become Williams'
personal command post. The telephone rings constantly with calls
from law-enforcement officers and well-wishers. Friends stop by.
The stereo, television and family pictures sitting on shelves in
the living room are almost obscured by cards of sympathy and
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   From the bedroom where he keeps his computer, Williams brought
in a stack of printouts, more than 1,400 messages the family has
received electronically from people all over the world. ``Forty
countries so far,'' he said. ``We're getting 50 to 100 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   After Christina disappeared, Williams said one of the first
people to contact his family was Marc Klaas, Polly's father, who
knows a thing or two about the nightmare of a missing young
daughter. His family's case came to a brutal end five years ago
when a man arrested for drunken driving confessed to kidnapping
Polly, who was 12, from a slumber party in her Sonoma County home,
strangling her and leaving her body at an abandoned lumber mill 30
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later the killer, Richard Allen Davis, was convicted
and given a death sentence. He remains in prison while his lawyers
appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Klaas case captured national attention not only for Polly's
age and the brazen acts of the killer, but also for the protocols
employed by law-enforcement agencies after the abduction was
reported. Fearing that news reports of Polly's disappearance would
hinder efforts to find her, investigators in Sonoma County delayed
releasing any information, including a description of the suspect,
his car and the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Left in the dark were two Sonoma County deputies who encountered
Davis on the night of the kidnapping, after a woman called to
complain about a trespasser. They found Davis with a car in a ditch
and questioned him for 30 minutes, then helped him pull the car
onto the road and let him go. Six minutes later, his description
was released. He was not caught for another two months.
</P>
<P>
   The delay and its consequences led to new procedures for child
abduction cases that stressed dispensing information quickly,
widely and continually through fliers, news conferences and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Williams has worked nonstop to keep Christina's
case in the public eye, winning widespread help from friends and
strangers alike. His boss, Paul Brewer, set up a volunteer center.
Celebrities like Clint Eastwood, Mariah Carey and Reggie Jackson
have made public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Christina began here on the Monterey Peninsula,
where investigators were helped by volunteers on horseback, by
psychics and even by people who said they could communicate with
Christina's dog. The search quickly expanded to contiguous counties
and beyond as the San Francisco office of the FBI made the case its
highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have received leads from 50 of our 56 divisions around the
country,'' said Gerald Buten, assistant special agent in charge of
the case, acknowledging the ambiguous impact of such a response.
``That's a positive development from the investigation standpoint.
But she could be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The search has had at least some residual benefits. In recent
weeks, the authorities have found the bodies of three other missing
young women in Northern California counties. At least one discovery
set off rumors that the victim was Christina.
</P>
<P>
   And so the wait goes on.
</P>
<P>
   `'You have to be positive _ you have to have hope,'' Williams
said. `'That's what keeps us going. You can't give up. It's your
child. How could you possibly give up hope on your child?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many negatives,'' he added. ``The only positive
thing to believe is that we'll get her back safely. We just have to
believe we will.''

OWNERS GROUP ABRUPTLY ENDS BARGAINING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Negotiators for the National Basketball Association
and its players met constructively, they thought, for nearly two
hours Thursday morning. Then they broke for lunch, and each side
had to wonder what was in the water that the other side had with
its food.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes after the negotiators returned from lunch, the
owners' group abruptly ended the bargaining session, leaving both
sides accusing the other of deliberately torpedoing the meeting and
the immediate chance for progress in the off-season lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like my four-year-old,'' said Karl Malone, who
traveled from Alaska for his first taste of collective bargaining.
``I don't want to play anymore so I'm going home.''
</P>
<P>
   The half dozen owners who were in the conference room of a
midtown Manhattan law office, on the other hand, were described as
stunned and insulted by post-lunch developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the best thing to do to preserve any semblance of a
bargaining balance for continuity would be to end discussions right
there,'' said Commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators were meeting for the first time since June 22,
the first time since the league imposed its lockout July 1,
suspending all NBA business, including the signing of free agents
and the payment of salary teams contractually owe players for the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now no further bargaining sessions are scheduled, though lawyers
for the league and the players will meet Friday with an arbitrator,
John Feerick, to schedule a hearing on the union's grievance over
the teams' failure to pay guaranteed salaries. Feerick's decision
in that case is expected to have a major impact on the future of
talks.
</P>
<P>
   League officials, in fact, suggested that the union strategy
centered not on negotiations but on the salary grievance and an
unfair labor practice charge it filed with the National Labor
Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy here is to litigate, arbitrate and make no
concessions,'' Granik said. Billy Hunter, the union chief,
countered by saying the players will use every avenue available to
them to undermine the lockout but that they want to negotiate a new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning session, the owners who were present engaged in
dialogue with the 13 players who were at the large table. Stern
called the exchange constructive. Hunter said at least part of it
was acrimonious, particularly an early exchange between Malone and
Jerry Colangelo of the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchange prompted the union to make a post-lunch
proposal. ``Colangelo,'' related Jeffrey Kessler, one of the
union's outside lawyers, ``said we had to address the drug
agreement, rookie issues and a hard salary cap. They want to slow
the growth of salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   So the union returned from lunch with a proposal that would
change the 20 percent salary increase veterans receive in new
contracts, grant clubs the right-of-first refusal on players ending
their three-year rookie contracts and would add marijuana to the
drug-testing list if all economic issues were resolved first.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners viewed the over-all effect of the elements of the
economic proposal as perilous. The union's ideas, they said, could
increase, not decrease, the percentage of revenue that would go to
player salaries. In addition, the owners took offense at remarks
made by Kessler after they said the proposal wasn't productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lecture you on the grave risk you face if you don't
take their proposal, that's when it's time to leave,'' Stern said.
``That's not the tone in which we address the players.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending months of anticipation with a resigned
shrug, Monica Lewinsky, the former intern, walked into a federal
courthouse here Thursday and testified that she and President
Clinton carried on a sexual affair within the White House,
according to a lawyer familiar with her account.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony before a federal grand jury, which contradicted a
previous sworn statement, tightened the legal and political vise
squeezing President Clinton. The president denied a sexual
relationship under oath in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit, and he has denied it as well to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, is investigating
charges that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice by
trying to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months of waiting for Ms. Lewinsky to tell her
story ended just before 8:30 a.m., when she stepped from a dark
green Toyota Land Cruiser, embraced a lawyer, shrugged and vanished
inside. As portable generators rumbled in the background and one
cameraman swept the scene from a cherrypicker 50 feet over 3rd
Street, about 20 satellite trucks beamed images of Ms. Lewinsky _
once an unpaid, anonymous sorter of White House mail _ around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, answered questions in exchange for immunity
from prosecution for any wrongdoing she describes. In a deal worked
out with prosecutors nine days ago, she is vulnerable to
prosecution only if she lies in her testimony. In an affidavit in
January in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky swore that she did not have
a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's described her six and a half
hours before the grand jury as grueling. ``She was asked very
specific questions about very private matters which are very hard
to discuss in public,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky has agonized for months over the prospect
of damaging Clinton's presidency, friends have said. One of her
friends described Ms. Lewinsky as saying Wednesday night, as she
prepared for her testimony, ``What I'm doing tomorrow is something
I never ever wanted to do. It breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Before another media mob scene after Ms. Lewinsky completed her
testimony, her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said that she answered
questions from prosecutors and jurors ``truthfully, completely, and
honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal finally
appears to be coming to an end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never publicly described his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky in any detail, beyond saying that it was not sexual.
</P>
<P>
   In a capital whipsawed between disclosure and denial, starkly
different days unspooled at the federal courthouse and the White
House. Summoning the authority and trappings of his office, as well
as his own storied political resilience, President Clinton went
about his official duties Thursday without betraying a hint of
interest in his former intern's testimony just a few blocks down
Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this day for quite a long time,''
Clinton said in one speech at a Washington hotel, referring to his
opportunity to address a White House conference on building
economic self-improvement in Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president appeared before a row of
uniformed police officers in the sun-gilded Rose Garden to call for
a permanent five-day waiting period for people seeking to buy
handguns. With a quick left-handed salute after the official
remarks, the president cued a brassy Marine band to strike up
``Stars and Stripes Forever.'' Reporters waiting to shout questions
about Ms. Lewinsky were stymied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some White House advisers gave vent to frustration over the
media spectacle at the courthouse and the unremitting pressure of
the Lewinsky investigation. ``I hate the whole thing,'' said one.
``I hate you, I hate us.'' Then, in his disgust, words failed him.
``Uggh,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, provided the official
reaction to the testimony. ``The president has not expressed any
views to us on this,'' he said, ``except we know that he does agree
with us _ and probably all Americans _ that if this means that
we're coming to the end of this four-year, over $40 million
investigation, then that would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the White House had no interest in
drawing attention Thursday. ``We're showing wise restraint,'' he
said. ``Nobody's going to criticize Ms. Lewinsky, and we're not
going to get in the story. It's a big enough story without us.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their restraint, White House advisers telephoned
reporters late Thursday evening to ask what they knew of Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Ms. Lewinsky's version of her relationship with
the president was still in doubt. But Starr's investigation has
rushed forward since then, with her immunity agreement and
Clinton's own promise to testify at the White House on Aug. 17. In
striking the deal with Starr, Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a navy
blue dress that prosecutors have sent for testing by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. They are trying to determine if the dress
stained in a sexual encounter with the president.

Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, is
guaranteed to do well, documents released by the companies showed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Eaton, 58, to stay on for three years under the
combined DaimlerChrysler, he can earn nine extra years on his
pension _ in addition to the three he would earn anyway. Those nine
extra years alone are worth $30,000 a month for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   But if he quits or is dismissed during the two years after the
merger, he will be paid $24.4 million, with DaimlerChrysler paying
the ``golden parachute'' tax for him and the taxes on the
compensation paid to cover the tax.
</P>
<P>
   And he will also get stock appreciation rights on 2.27 million
shares of DaimlerChrysler, a benefit worth almost $23 million for
each $10 rise in the price of the company's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Severance benefits and stock appreciation rights were also
issued to 29 other Chrysler executives, but only Eaton was given
the pension sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   The pay plans were disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by the the No. 3 United States auto maker and
the German luxury-car company in anticipation of closing their
merger in November.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler has scheduled a special shareholder meeting for Sept.
18 in Wilmington, Del., to vote on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be issued DaimlerChrysler shares, which will
trade on exchanges around the world, including the New York Stock
Exchange. Each Chrysler share will be exchanged for 0.6235 share of
DaimlerChrysler. A holder of 100 Chrysler shares would be issued 62
shares of the new company and a cash payment for the difference,
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz shareholders will exchange shares on a one-for-one
basis unless 90 percent swap their shares for DaimlerChrysler
stock, in which case they will receive a bonus of one-half of a
percent, giving them 1.005 shares of DaimlerChrysler for each
Daimler-Benz share. That bonus is so small that either way,
Daimler-Benz shareholders will have 58 percent of the new company
and Chrysler shareholders the remaining 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how the global economy will make life more
complicated for investors, the two companies said that Americans
who hold DaimlerChrysler shares would also face new tax
complications. One-quarter of each dividend payment will be
withheld to pay German taxes, but by filing a German tax form most
of the tax can be refunded, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger highlights key differences in the compensation styles
of German and American companies.
</P>
<P>
   No compensation details were disclosed for Jurgen Schrempp, the
chairman of Daimler-Benz, and the nine other top executives there
because their compensation packages are not being changed by the
deal. Schrempp was paid no more than $2 million last year, compared
with $6.1 million in salary, bonus, incentive pay and other cash
for Eaton, who also made $5.3 million from exercising stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger is complete, Eaton will also receive $66.2
million in DaimlerChrysler stock in exchange for Chrysler options
of the same value, and $3.7 million in cash, the bonus he earned
for the first 11 months of the year under Chrysler's pay plan.
</P>
<P>
   Chris P. Theodore, a vice president for engineering at Chrysler,
said that he and colleagues were joking recently about how they
hope compensation changes after the merger. ``What we said was: `We
have a great idea. We'll have Daimler vacation policy and Chrysler
pay policy,' '' Theodore said.

GLOBE COLUMNIST REFUSES TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Globe and columnist Mike Barnicle found themselves at
a standoff Thursday, with the newspaper continuing to demand his
resignation and Barnicle declining to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper spokesman Rick Gulla said management had not fired
him, but still wanted him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides continued their delicate dance, newsroom
employees reeled over the allegation that Barnicle had plagiarized
some material from a book by comedian George Carlin and had then
been less than truthful when questioned about it by the newspaper's
top editors.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the paper and one its star columnists came
barely two months after another Globe columnist, Patricia Smith,
was forced to resign after she admitted fabricating characters in
some of her columns. And it comes in a year in which several other
publications and a television network have had to retract
controversial stories deemed to have been inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail message to the staff from Globe Editor Matthew Storin,
who was vacationing in Italy, did little to dispel the gloom and
confusion. An executive of The Globe, which is owned by The New
York Times Co., said Thursday night that Globe Publisher Benjamin
Taylor would meet with Barnicle Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   One senior newsroom employee _ who, like most others
interviewed, requested anonymity, _ said: ``People are really
dispirited, they are upset and a lot of people are angry that all
they know about this is from what they've read in the paper. It's
like the second death in the family in six weeks and the head of
the family hasn't got time to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to force out Barnicle, the Globe has taken on one
of the last in a breed of powerful big-city newspaper columnists.
While he has his critics, Barnicle has built a reputation for
speaking for the working-class neighborhoods of Boston. Calls and
e-mail messages to the newspaper on Thursday were heavily in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters contended that newspaper management was trying to
sacrifice him in a misguided attempt at fairness, that his offense
was not on a par with the admitted fabrications that led to the
forced resignation of Ms. Smith in June.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, 55, is white and close to what Globe insiders call the
paper's ``Irish mafia.'' Ms. Smith, 42, is black and was brought to
the Globe by Storin, who was her editor at The Chicago Sun Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barnicle's colleagues, however, supported Storin's
decision to ask for Barnicle's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk radio chat has been, `Oh, this was a tit-for-tat
firing, a white columnist to make up for firing a black one,'''
said one newsroom employee who requested anonymity. ``But we know
and he knows, I think, deep down that we are a profession and we
have to have standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In between writing two to three columns a week, Barnicle has
often been among the guests at the wakes of his colleagues' parents
or slain policemen. He gave his Red Sox tickets to janitors and
telephone operators at the Globe. In print, he made a name with
two-fisted prose attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1988 column he wrote, ``The people who dish out beatings,
robberies and rapes too often are not afraid of the police and
certainly do not fear the courts.'' And he added, ``A jail term is
too far down the road to be a factor in the daily life of a
maggot.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he rose to prominence, he also gave the impression of
bending the rules that bound his colleagues and ignoring criticism
that some of his quotes and characters were too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   An early example came in 1979, six years after he was hired at
the Globe. A former political speechwriter, Barnicle was invited on
a congressional trip to Southeast Asia and offered to write about
it for the paper. According to Barnicle, the Globe declined.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle took vacation time and went on the trip anyway, writing
articles for James Bellows, then the editor of The Los Angeles
Herald Examiner. One of those articles ended up on the front page
of The Boston Herald American, the Globe's arch-rival, according to
both men.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the competition is forbidden by most newspapers. In
an interview earlier this week, before the latest furor, Barnicle
said, ``That was back in the time when we took ourselves far less
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's flouting of that professional convention in the late
1970s was matched in the mid-1990s by his willingness to flout the
convention that there should be no smoking in a no-smoking
building. Barnicle said he smoked cigars in his office and welcomed
other smokers there.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his refusal to address criticisms of his work that
most concerned his colleagues. In 1991, Boston Magazine examined
one of Barnicle's articles and could find no evidence that two
characters in it ever existed. In the article, Barnicle was quoted
as telling the reporter that he had given one of the people he had
written about the magazine's telephone number. ``If he wants to
talk to you, he'll call you,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, attorney Alan Dershowitz had accused Barnicle of
falsely attributing a racist quote to him. Neither Barnicle nor the
Globe retracted the column, but in a confidential legal settlement
reached after his complaint, the Globe agreed to pay Dershowitz
$75,000, according to a lawyer who has been briefed on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to police reporting, ``it's safe to say ...
Barnicle has a reputation for having an unusual high level of
access'' to police sources, said Alfred S. Larkin Jr., a former
managing editor who is now the Globe's vice president and assistant
to the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   One story that Barnicle based on sources, however, came under
heavy criticism. In early 1990, Barnicle had been leading the
coverage of Charles Stuart, a Boston man who shot and killed his
pregnant wife, blamed the shooting on a black man, then jumped to
his death from a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his reporting proved solid, Barnicle wrote one
article no other reporter could confirm. Under a banner headline,
he reported that the Prudential Insurance Co. had issued a check
for $480,000 to Stuart, in payment of a life insurance policy for
his wife, Carol DeMaiti Stuart. The day the article ran, the
company denied it. No similar check has been found. The Globe,
which has occasionally corrected other facts in Barnicle's columns
over the years, ran no correction.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Moore, the Globe's managing editor, said last week, ``Our
reporting on the Carol Stuart case after Charles Stuart committed
suicide still stands, except for the $480,000 check. I don't think
anyone involved in that case thinks we shouldn't have corrected
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle said of the incident, ``Three different people told me
about the check.'' Was it worth correcting? ``No. It had nothing to
do with Chuck going off the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   But it fueled the pervasive sense that Barnicle operated by his
own set of rules.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When in late 1995, Walter Robinson, who was running the Globe's
Metro desk, brought to the top editors evidence of his suspicions
that Patricia Smith had been fabricating characters in 27 columns,
the issue of Barnicle's reputation quickly became part of the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dealing with a number of different factors,'' Storin
said in an interview last month. ``There were the rumors and
rumblings about Barnicle, none of them proven.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Smith had been confronted with her alleged fabrications
in 1995, Storin said last month, the issue of Barnicle would
inevitably have been raised. ``If we had to dismiss her in that
time frame, then Barnicle would be caught up in the wake of that
and I wasn't sure if I could save him, even if the charges had been
unfounded,'' Storin said. ``He and the paper had been a little
dismissive and a little arrogant about the charges, unfair as they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the choice of enforcing journalistic standards on Ms.
Smith, at the risk of seeming unfair, or choosing an approach they
believed would be fair to all, Storin and his top editors agreed
that the three Metro columnists _ Barnicle, Ms. Smith, and Eileen
McNamara _ would be informed about the paper's standards of
accuracy and that their columns would be spot-checked from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, a reader called The Globe asking about the
similarities between Barnicle's column and Carlin's book. Two days
later, the paper asked for Barnicle's resignation.

UNITED HEALTHCARE TAKING A $900 MILLION CHARGE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proving that few, if any, companies are immune to the financial
perils facing health care providers, the United Healthcare Corp.,
one of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations, said
Thursday that it was taking a $900 million charge in its second
quarter, in part to abandon unprofitable Medicare plans.
</P>
<P>
   The move ignited an investor stampede out of health care stocks
and possibly jeopardized United Healthcare's proposed $5.5 billion
merger with its rival, Humana Inc., which would create the nation's
largest HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, United Healthcare's announcement, unexpected by
Wall Street analysts and investors, raised serious questions as to
whether HMOs can make money covering Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to forget that Medicare was created because
private insurers could not make money on the elderly population,''
said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights
Center, a consumer organization in New York. ``Now managed-care
plans are discovering the same lesson all over again and are
getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that many people on Medicare will not be
affected. But the company did not give details about which markets
it might leave or how it might change its coverage. Analysts said
that the most vulnerable markets were those where United Healthcare
does not have enough enrollees to negotiate steep discounts with
hospitals and doctors. For example, Utah is nearly devoid of
managed-care coverage for people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While United Healthcare had said it would realign its
operations, few analysts expected the scope to be so broad or the
write-off, covering future Medicare losses and its exit from some
markets, so steep. Having watched many of its competitors like
Oxford Health Plans stumble, United Healthcare, based in
Minneapolis, had emerged as Wall Street's best hope for managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman and chief executive, William McGuire, was
well liked and viewed as having a strong grasp of the fundamental
issues of managed care. ``They were and supposedly are the best in
the industry,'' said Larry Feinberg of Oracle Partners, a New York
hedge fund that specializes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   That belief was largely shattered when the company revealed the
reorganization charge as the cause of its $565 million loss in the
second quarter. United Healthcare said that the company's
continuing operations remained profitable, with its commercial
business remaining robust, but acknowledged that it could not
afford to cover Medicare patients in some areas. The company said
it was losing money in two-thirds of the 24 markets where it
provides care to people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is clearly our largest disappointment,'' McGuire
said. The company also said it was leaving several commercial
markets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who were caught completely off guard by the news,
immediately fled the stock, dumping many other health care stocks
in their wake. United Healthcare plunged $15, or 28.4 percent, to
$37.875. Humana dropped $6.625, or 25.7 percent, to $19.125.
Pacificare Health Systems fell $5.375, to $63.75, and Wellpoint
Health Networks dropped $1.6875, to $56.25.
</P>
<P>
   With health care stocks tumbling, and with United Healthcare
indicating that it was rethinking its aggressive push into the
Medicare market, analysts questioned the fate of United
Healthcare's pending acquisition of Humana. A spokeswoman for
United Healthcare said Thursday that the deal was still progressing
on schedule, but Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., was not so
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the announcement was made public, Humana, which
received no warning of United Healthcare's write-off, released a
terse statement saying it would not comment on the charge until it
discussed the matter with United Healthcare executives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McGuire said Thursday during a meeting with analysts that
federal and state regulatory review of the merger was continuing
and that the shareholder vote was expected at the end of this
month. Asked about Humana's statement, he refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stock prices so low, the acquisition may be
renegotiated,'' said Linda Varoli, an analyst with Merger Insight.
``Humana's board of directors has a responsibility to their
shareholders. They may want more assurances from United Healthcare
or get more considerations from them in the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And much of the merger's appeal is Humana's strong presence in
the Medicare market, although McGuire emphasized that United's
losses were caused by the start-up nature of its programs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the acquisition is completed, United Healthcare, which
says it has 1.3 million people in New York, Connecticut and New
Jersey and is an aggressive player in the area, will face questions
about its commitment to Medicare patients. Consumer advocates
clamored Thursday that United Healthcare's move to drop certain
counties was typical given that HMOs tended to put profits in front
of health care.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuire said that United Healthcare was not abandoning this
group. ``We remain committed to serving seniors in a variety of
ways,'' McGuire said Thursday. United Healthcare will re-evaluate
its programs in specific markets to see whether it can generate
what he described as ``acceptable margins.'' Still, the company is
prepared, he said, to leave markets where it cannot make money.
</P>
<P>
   United is the latest managed-care company to stumble in an
attempt to make money serving the Medicare population, and many of
its competitors have decided to withdraw from that market. Oxford
has attributed some of its heavy losses on its Medicare programs in
some areas, and several companies, including Anthem Blue Cross and
Blue Shield and Health Net in California, have recently decided to
throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of serving people on Medicare make it virtually
impossible to make money, said Karen Korn, a health care services
analyst at Putnam Investments in Boston. The government has
approved rate increases for Medicare-managed programs of about 2
percent while medical costs are rising at 4 percent or higher.
``There's no way that translates into OK margins,'' Ms. Korn said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's push to have more Medicare members in
managed care, there may be few providers who remain interested in
serving the population. ``We'll see a lot more dropping out of it
than getting into it,'' predicted Barry Barnett, a principal at
Kwasha HR Solutions, a unit of Price Waterhouse Coopers.
</P>
<P>
   But United Healthcare's woes also raise the question of whether
managed care works as a model for the future of health care in
keeping costs under control. While the company's difficulties are
limited to caring for the elderly, it is unclear how successful any
managed-care company will be once it covers more people. The
backlash from consumers, who are increasingly demanding more from
their plans and want more choice of doctors and hospitals, adds to
the difficulty of containing costs. ``You can't make huge margins
in this business long term,'' Feinberg argued.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Thursday's announcement on employers, many of whom
are now choosing health plans for their employees, is unclear.
While some benefits consultants said that they thought the news
would have little effect, others said that it would give some
employers pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of managed-care companies believing they can control
health care costs,'' said Todd Richter, a health care analyst at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They need to learn how to price
health care. They are insurance companies. And that means they are
in the risk-management business.''

FEC TOLD OF FBI RECORDINGS OF EAST TEXAS CANDIDATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Orange, Texas) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Telephone conversations secretly recorded by the FBI
show that east Texas congressional candidate Brian Babin knew about
the illegal funneling of contributions to his 1996 campaign, a
central figure in the case told the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Babin, a Woodville dentist running this year for the
second time against Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Turner of Crockett,
has denied knowing about or participating in the illegal donation
of $37,000 through Cloeren Inc., a plastics manufacturer in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Babin maintained his innocence Thursday, saying that federal
prosecutors would have brought charges against him if the
recordings contained evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But company owner Peter Cloeren Jr., who is serving two years on
probation and paying a $400,000 fine for his role in the scheme,
says in a complaint to the federal agency that Babin admitted last
February that he had known about the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cloeren met with Democratic congressional
investigators Thursday in Houston to discuss his allegations, said
a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``so rare that you have one of the participants coming
forward. What Mr. Cloeren does moves this from being an allegation
to something specific and concrete,'' Waxman spokesman Phil
Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of Cloeren's complaint to the Federal Election
Commission says that Babin and Cloeren talked on the telephone Feb.
13, a day after both were interviewed by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Babin remarked in the call that he was glad that he and his son
had personally picked up the contribution checks from Cloeren
employees, ``or else the government would have us on mail fraud as
well,'' according to Cloeren.
</P>
<P>
   Babin also expressed concern that a disgruntled Cloeren employee
had exposed the scheme, Cloeren told the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant for Babin's 1996 campaign, Walter Whetsell of South
Carolina, confirmed in a separate talk with Cloeren that day that
Babin had known about the illegal money transfer, according to
Cloeren.
</P>
<P>
   Babin said Thursday he was unaware until this week that FBI
agents made the recordings after asking Cloeren to make the calls.
</P>
<P>
   He denied making a remark about mail fraud and added that he may
have expressed concern that Cloeren may have been implicated by one
of his own workers.
</P>
<P>
   But, Babin said, he has already been cleared by the federal
prosecutors in Beaumont who brought the charges against Cloeren.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prosecutors said they have no evidence of wrongdoing by
Babin. They were unavailable for comment Thursday about Cloeren's
complaint to the Federal Election Commission. Whetsell also could
not be reached, and the FEC does not discuss the specifics of the
complaints until they after they are processed.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Cloeren pleaded guilty to using his employees as a
conduit to evade the $1,000-per-person federal limit on
contributions to Babin's campaign. The company used fake travel
vouchers to reimburse employees who wrote checks to Babin,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Babin said Thursday that Cloeren, his former supporter, is
making the allegations out of bitterness about being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Babin also charged that Democrat Turner was manipulating Cloeren
to turn attention away from investigations of alleged fund-raising
violations by the Democratic Party. Turner is a member of the House
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, which is conducting
hearings on campaign irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said his actions are not personal but are instead part
of the national effort to reform campaign practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecuting John Q. Public (himself) doesn't solve this
campaign finance issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed a letter he received from Babin two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could take it all back I would,'' the letter said. ``I
would never have run had I known what would happen to you. I am
sorry. I am very sorry.``
</P>
<P>
   Babin said Thursday he was ``reaching out'' to his former
political supporter rather than apologizing for his own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren declined to discuss any meetings with congressional
staffers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman, the Democratic congressman from California, on Thursday
urged the chairman of the oversight committee, Republican Dan
Burton of Indiana, to investigate the allegations about Babin.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman noted Cloeren's additional allegation that the Republican
majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, participated in discussions
about using Cloeren's money to help Babin in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has denied wrongdoing
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that while no hearing has been scheduled on
Republican fund-raising groups, the committee has received
documents on Triad Management Services, which allegedly funneled
money from conservatives to key congressional campaigns. Cloeren
contributed to an offshoot of Triad which paid for television
advertisements in 1996 attacking Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Babin are vying to represent the 2nd Congressional
District, which runs from the northeast border of Harris County to
parts of East Texas and the Louisiana border.

LEWINSKY TELLS HER STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern
at the center of a national scandal that has jeopardized the
Clinton presidency, broke nearly seven months of silence Thursday
by testifying before a federal grand jury investigating her
relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was expected to tell the grand jury that she had a
sexual relationship with Clinton. She was also expected to say she
does not believe he encouraged her to lie under oath, though they
explored ways to keep the relationship a secret, a source close to
the case said.
</P>
<P>
   As the major witness against him finally started detailing the
events in the biggest personal crisis of his presidency, Clinton
tried to go about business as usual. A mile from the federal
courthouse, the president appeared at a Rose Garden ceremony with
gun control activists and later spoke to the Conference on Building
Economic Self-Determination in Indian Communities at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel, a few blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, spent about six hours in the closed grand jury
room and left without a word to the hundreds of journalists and
onlookers camped outside. Her family spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said
only: ``She answered each question truthfully, completely, and
honestly that was posed to her'' by prosecutors and some of the
grand jurors. ``Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal
finally appears to be coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Lewinsky's lawyers, said his client has
not been told if she has to reappear before the grand jury. ``I
think she did a fine job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A relationship that allegedly began in private in a room off the
Oval Office two years ago is being dissected in public _ on radio
and television and in print media across the United States and
around the world. What started out as Internet gossip at the
beginning of this year has evolved into a full-sized scandal, with
Supreme Court rulings, speculation about a presidential apology,
and even talk of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The case goes beyond sex: Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
is attempting to put together a case that shows a pattern of lies
and obstruction of justice by the president.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's two public appearances, Clinton slipped out of
view for the rest of the day. He spent part of the afternoon with
his attorney, David E. Kendall, to prepare for his grand jury
appearance via closed-circuit television Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of the Rose Garden, Clinton did not respond to
reporters' shouted questions. The Marine Band struck up ``Stars and
Stripes Forever,'' drowning out the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Later, deputy White House press secretary Barry Toiv said, ``I
found that music refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Toiv, who has followed a policy of saying as little as possible,
described Clinton's mood as ``great.'' Asked how Clinton felt about
Lewinsky finally testifying, Toiv repeated the official White House
line: ``If this means that we're coming to the end of this
four-year, over $40 million investigation, then that would be a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who can shed light on whether Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice to hide the affair, arrived at the
US District Courthouse at about 8:30 a.m. under heavy security.
Dressed in a dark blue suit and pearls, Lewinsky gave a nervous hug
to Sydney Jean Hoffman, one of her lawyers, with whom she has
developed a special bond.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lewinsky disappeared through a side door, her legal team
and press spokeswoman in tow. She was whisked away to the third
floor on an elevator normally reserved for judges. She entered the
grand jury room alone; her lawyers had to wait outside.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no word on a navy blue dress belonging to
Lewinsky that the FBI is testing for genetic material that could be
linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony followed an agreement reached last week
with Starr for full immunity in exchange for her truthful
testimony. Her mother, Marcia Lewis, also was given full immunity,
and reportedly, so was her father.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified amid questions about her credibility from
Clinton's allies and critics alike. In the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, Lewinsky signed an affidavit stating she and
the president had never had sexual relations. But Thursday she
reportedly planned to contradict that statement. And in a taped
conversation with her former colleague, Linda R. Tripp, she
portrayed herself as a compulsive liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is damaged goods any way you look at it,'' said Laurie
Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and associate dean of the
Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ``She's given conflicting
stories, and you can't be sure which time she told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, a prosecutor would likely say that a witness
lied because of fear or pressure, Levenson said. But now, the
prosecutor would argue, Lewinsky is telling the truth because she
does not want to jeopardize her immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gloria Allred, president of the Womens Equal Rights Legal
Defense and Education Fund in Los Angeles, said Lewinsky's taped
statements could haunt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would lie for her family, does that mean she
would lie for the president of the United States? ... Would she
encourage other people to lie?'' Allred said.
</P>
<P>
   The indications are that Lewinsky testified that she had sexual
relations with the president but that he did not ask her to lie
about their relationship. That mixed message, Allred said, would
confound the president's critics, who say they believe he pressured
Lewinsky. ``Are they going to pick and choose what they believe of
Monica Lewinsky, cafeteria style?''

LEWINSKY DETAILS SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CLINTON TO GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky, the former intern at the center of
a sex-and-perjury investigation that has rocked the White House,
appeared before a federal grand jury Thursday and described a
sexual relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky spent a little over six hours providing grand jurors
with a first-person account of a relationship that reportedly
contradicts the president's denials six months ago that they
engaged in sex or talked about covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from prosecutors and grand jurors, Lewinsky
provided details of a dozen sexual encounters with Clinton at the
White House over an 18-month period, The Associated Press reported.
She also recounted their discussions of ways to keep the trysts
secret, according to the account, based on unnamed sources. At the
same time, Lewinsky told the grand jury that Clinton never urged
her to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The claims by Lewinsky, if supported by other evidence or
testimony gathered by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, open the
president to possible charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
in the now-dismissed Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Lewinsky left the courthouse, family spokeswoman
Judy Smith told reporters that Lewinsky ``answered each question
truthfully, completely and honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewinsky, 25, began her testimony in the investigation that
imperils his presidency, Clinton and his aides tried to maintain a
business-as-usual front several blocks away at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden with Vice President Al Gore,
Attorney General Janet Reno, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Jim
and Sarah Brady and several police officers to call on Congress to
make permanent the five-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second time this week, the president employed the
Marine Band to drown out reporters' questions. This time, the band
struck up a medley of patriotic tunes when Clinton gave a
left-handed saluted to the conductor, then began to make his way
through the crowd toward the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later met with his private attorneys to continue
preparing for his Aug. 17 testimony to grand jurors via
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Barry Toiv insisted that Thursday was
another routine day at the White House. ``What event?'' he
deadpanned when asked about Lewinsky's visit to the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv insisted Clinton had expressed no opinion about Lewinsky's
grand jury appearance. ``But he does agree with us and all
Americans (that) if we are coming to the end of this four-year, $40
million investigation, that would be a good thing,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's long-awaited appearance comes on the heels of a
parade of lawyers, secretaries, presidential bodyguards and other
former interns called by Starr's prosecutors to testify before the
grand jury over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed four years ago to investigate Clinton's business
dealings in Arkansas and later broadened to include various
scandals at the White House, Starr's inquiry was expanded in
January to include allegations of sex-and-perjury involving the
president and the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   Since reaching an immunity deal in which she can only be
prosecuted if she lies to Starr or the grand jury, Lewinsky has
told prosecutors about efforts by herself and Clinton to conceal
the relationship that they had denied under oath as part of Jones'
lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lewinsky reportedly was prepared to recount
conversations with Clinton in which they allegedly discussed how to
use Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary, as an
intermediary for returning gifts he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her deal with Starr, Lewinsky also turned over
voice-mail messages she had saved of telephone calls from Clinton.
She also has turned over a blue dress that the FBI was testing to
determine if it contains any DNA material that would prove Lewinsky
wore it, as she reportedly claims, during a sexual encounter with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Until Lewinsky testified Thursday, grand jurors had only heard
her voice on tape recordings of telephone conversations with Linda
Tripp reportedly about the affair. The tapes were made by Tripp,
who triggered the investigation when she turned the illicit
recordings over to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain late Thursday whether Lewinsky would be called
back for more questioning before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony and what Clinton has to say in his Aug. 17
appearance are key to a decision by Starr on whether, or when, to
send Congress a report that could cite possible perjury and
obstruction of justice by the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt said
he was ``sick of hearing'' about the Lewinsky investigation and
said Starr would be making a ``grave mistake'' to send an
impeachment report to Congress before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very partisan, very unfair and demeaning to the
process that I think all of us believe is important to this
country,'' Gephardt said.

SUNBEAM SAYS IT MIGHT ADJUST FINANCIAL RESULTS BACK TO 1996 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunbeam Corp. said Thursday that it would have to restate last
year's financial statements and possibly the results for 1996 and
the first quarter of this year as well, because of possible
accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled appliance maker said it expected to restate the
results by the end of September and until then would be unable to
report second-quarter results, which typically would have been
available by the middle of this month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company had previously said it expected to have to restate
last year's numbers, but it is now signaling that there may be
problems with results for other periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever problems there may be started a little longer ago
than even I anticipated,'' said William Steele, an analyst who
follows the company for Buckingham Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam gave no hint as to the size of what it said would be a
``material adjustment'' of at least the 1997 results. But Steele
estimated that the company may have to reduce the profits for 1997
by between $25 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the adjustments came a day after Sunbeam and
Albert J. Dunlap, the former chairman and chief executive ousted by
the board in June, signed a ``joint cooperation agreement'' to
share various documents related to lawsuits and an investigation
into the financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company and representatives for Dunlap cannot agree
about what they agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's representatives continue to maintain that he and the
company agreed to share information and legal strategies. Sunbeam,
while initially declining to comment on the arrangement, now says
it never agreed to share legal defense strategies or information
with Dunlap, only access to ``nonprivileged information'' so that
he would agree to resign from the board.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which was obtained by The New York Times from an
executive close to Sunbeam, includes a phrase that says ``a
cooperation agreement is advisable to minimize the possibility of
duplication of efforts.'' So the bickering comes down to an
interpretation of what it means to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides sought to put their spin on the agreement dispute,
the company also tried to reassure investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunbeam's new management team is continuing its efforts to
rebuild Sunbeam and restore its business to profitability,'' said
Jerry W. Levin, the new chief executive. His assurances, though,
were not enough to soothe shareholders, who sent the stock down $1,
to a new low of $7.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in June, just two weeks after the board
dismissed Dunlap, saying it had lost confidence in his leadership
after several quarters of unexpected bad results, that there were
unanswered questions about its 1997 financial statements and that
the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its
accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem, in part, from sales promotions put in place
under Dunlap's watch. Those promotions pushed too much product
through the pipeline and may have resulted in sales being booked in
the wrong quarters, as well as other potential accounting
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles have resulted in a lawsuits filed by shareholders
who say they were misled about the company's health. Sunbeam and
Dunlap have denied the allegations.

AUTO SAFETY: YOU'RE ON CANDID CAMERA. PAY UP. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., Calif.)  (Duplication warning: also filed in `a' category.) 
(mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drive aggressively on the Beltway, Interstate 495,
north or east of Washington, and a computer-operated radar gun and
camera will single your car out; the computer will look up the
registration and send a warning letter to the owner. A Maryland
state trooper may watch, too, but the system can operate on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Run a red light at some intersections in Howard County, Md., and
even though no police officer is in sight, a $75 ticket will be
mailed to the car's owner. Do the same in Oxnard, Calif., and the
computer-generated fine will be $270, plus points on the driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Robocop has arrived, although not as the gun-toting cyborg
envisioned by Hollywood. Cameras and computers at strategic
intersections are taking note of thousands of violations annually,
and doling out more citations than an equivalent number of
flesh-and-blood officers could write up.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen police departments around the country have begun
automated ticketing. New York City was one of the first, five years
ago, and now operates red-light cameras in all five boroughs. As in
Maryland, tickets are sent to the owners of the cars caught on
film.
</P>
<P>
   Some departments initially feared a public backlash, and have
mostly avoided using the systems for speed enforcement, a
technology that threatens virtually every driver and thus raises
the public's ire. But police say they have found widespread support
_ or at least, few complaints _ for using the technology to catch
drivers who run red lights. ``It's so much more blatant, and so
much more dangerous,'' said Joseph Genovese, a traffic engineer in
Oxnard, where the sanctions _ a big fine and points against the
license _ are relatively tough.
</P>
<P>
   And, officers say, technology is the only practical way to catch
red-light runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a marked police car at an intersection, they're
creating a hazard themselves by chasing a person down,'' said Lt.
Glenn Hansen, commander of the automated enforcement division in
Howard County, which is between Washington and Baltimore. ``If you
don't chase the person, it looks like you don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's program is an experiment authorized by Maryland
legislators for his county alone, but others would like to do the
same. The county has 12 cameras now, and plans to have 20 by the
end of the summer. They are rotated among 26 sites to keep drivers
guessing. Installation costs from $7,500 to $12,000 each, including
the placement of two ``loop detector'' wires buried in the pavement
that sense the presence of a car by measuring its magnetic field,
and a pole to put the camera on.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is off until the light is red _ in fact, it gives a
grace period of three-tenths of a second. If the light is red, the
shutter is activated by one loop detector at the crosswalk, and a
second in the intersection itself. If the system senses gridlock,
it does not open the camera's shutter.
</P>
<P>
   The color photos, showing the back of the car and the red light,
are persuasive on the summons, Hansen said; fewer people contest
the tickets issued by the machine than the ones given by human
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer records exactly when each picture was taken, and by
seeing where the car was in the first and second photo, officers
can calculate the vehicle's speed. They do not use that measurement
to issue speeding tickets, but if the car owner goes to court,
police use the calculation to show the judge how the car was being
driven.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland does not attempt to identify the driver. It tickets the
owner, for allowing the car to be used in an unsafe manner. Experts
say that the driver is almost always the owner or a close relative
anyway, and that if an accident resulted, the owner would be
responsible no matter who was driving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oxnard blames the driver. It issues tickets that carry points
against the owners' license, but people who say they were not
behind the wheel when the ticket was issued can go to court to show
that their faces do not match the machine's photos.
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard's photos are taken from in front of the vehicle, and in
only 40 to 45 percent of them are both the drivers' faces and the
license plates clear; if they are not clear, the case is discarded.
Howard County's system takes a picture from the rear and usually
gets a legible plate number.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 months that Oxnard has been issuing the tickets,
Genovese said accidents caused by drivers' running red lights were
down by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robocop has plenty of work to do. Nationally, the leading cause
of crashes are drivers who ignore red lights or stop signs, said
Richard Retting, a safety engineer at the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Such crashes kill 800 people in cars every year, he said, and
probably a substantial number of pedestrians. But counting the dead
pedestrians killed by red-light runners is difficult. ``There is
very little good information to go by,'' he said, ``since the
driver is alive but the pedestrian is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland State Police are trying a highway variation on the
robocop approach, with a camera that can pick out the
fastest-moving car in a group. Big overhead signs warn,
``Aggressive driver imaging in use.''
</P>
<P>
   State law does not permit computerized ticketing for speeding,
so the system is now being used to issue warnings. The system can
be set up on a highway shoulder and is supposed to run unattended,
but the software still needs work, according to a state police
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of machines reprimanding people seems too harsh, it
sits well with people who put safety first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your civil rights are different in a car,'' said Stephanie
Faul, a spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, an
affiliate of the auto club. ``The Constitution mentions your house
and your gun, but not your car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic surveillance troubles some civil liberties
watchdogs. ``It has a Big Brother aspect,'' said R. Kent Willis,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia. ``We
don't like it.'' But he added that his group had not yet mounted a
court challenge. ``Legally, we haven't been able to come up with a
good theory yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Oakland, Calif., announced that it would install cameras to
survey pedestrians as a crime-fighting measure, an ACLU chapter in
Northern California successfully defeated the plan, but the chapter
has not opposed traffic-enforcement cameras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faul of the AAA Foundation said automated ticketing ``does
not harm law-abiding citizens,'' adding, ``If we can put up
red-light cameras, and keep people from running them without
endangering officers, I'm all for it.''

   The color photos, showing the back of the car and the red light,
are persuasive on the summons, Hansen said; fewer people contest
the tickets issued by the machine than the ones given by human
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer records exactly when each picture was taken, and by
seeing where the car was in the first and second photo, officers
can calculate the vehicle's speed. They do not use that measurement
to issue speeding tickets, but if the car owner goes to court,
police use the calculation to show the judge how the car was being
driven.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland does not attempt to identify the driver. It tickets the
owner, for allowing the car to be used in an unsafe manner. Experts
say that the driver is almost always the owner or a close relative
anyway, and that if an accident resulted, the owner would be
responsible no matter who was driving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oxnard blames the driver. It issues tickets that carry points
against the owners' license, but people who say they were not
behind the wheel when the ticket was issued can go to court to show
that their faces do not match the machine's photos.
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard's photos are taken from in front of the vehicle, and in
only 40 to 45 percent of them are both the drivers' faces and the
license plates clear; if they are not clear, the case is discarded.
Howard County's system takes a picture from the rear and usually
gets a legible plate number.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 months that Oxnard has been issuing the tickets,
Genovese said accidents caused by drivers' running red lights were
down by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robocop has plenty of work to do. Nationally, the leading cause
of crashes are drivers who ignore red lights or stop signs, said
Richard Retting, a safety engineer at the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Such crashes kill 800 people in cars every year, he said, and
probably a substantial number of pedestrians. But counting the dead
pedestrians killed by red-light runners is difficult. ``There is
very little good information to go by,'' he said, ``since the
driver is alive but the pedestrian is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland State Police are trying a highway variation on the
robocop approach, with a camera that can pick out the
fastest-moving car in a group. Big overhead signs warn,
``Aggressive driver imaging in use.''
</P>
<P>
   State law does not permit computerized ticketing for speeding,
so the system is now being used to issue warnings. The system can
be set up on a highway shoulder and is supposed to run unattended,
but the software still needs work, according to a state police
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of machines reprimanding people seems too harsh, it
sits well with people who put safety first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your civil rights are different in a car,'' said Stephanie
Faul, a spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, an
affiliate of the auto club. ``The Constitution mentions your house
and your gun, but not your car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic surveillance troubles some civil liberties
watchdogs. ``It has a Big Brother aspect,'' said R. Kent Willis,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia. ``We
don't like it.'' But he added that his group had not yet mounted a
court challenge. ``Legally, we haven't been able to come up with a
good theory yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Oakland, Calif., announced that it would install cameras to
survey pedestrians as a crime-fighting measure, an ACLU chapter in
Northern California successfully defeated the plan, but the chapter
has not opposed traffic-enforcement cameras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faul of the AAA Foundation said automated ticketing ``does
not harm law-abiding citizens,'' adding, ``If we can put up
red-light cameras, and keep people from running them without
endangering officers, I'm all for it.''

MOUNTAINS OF BAD DEBT STIFLE RUSSIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was April when Dmitri Chernikh saw the first ripples
of Russia's financial crisis lapping at the door of Galatica, one
of Russia's hottest computer software companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the collapse of the Russian financial markets, or the
dizzying leap in interest rates, or even the first uncertain steps
of the country's new untested government that worried Chernikh or
his fellow directors. Like most other young Russian businesses,
Galatica, with $8 million in sales last year, does not trade its
shares publicly, nor has it ever sought bank loans, rates for which
were prohibitive even before the latest financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   What hit Galatica last spring was something more basic, and more
endemic to Russia's unfinished economic crisis: a pile-up of unpaid
bills, which by midsummer had topped $3 million, as the company's
biggest clients _ mostly in the rich and powerful energy sector _
stopped payments on Galatica's popular management software package.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the agreement last month for a $22.6 billion package
of credits and loans, Russia's financial crisis is still playing
itself out on the wider landscape of the Russian economy _ if a
devastated industrial base, an infant private sector and a cartel
of moguls who control banking, raw materials and other key sectors
can be properly called an economy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the government, Galatica swung quickly into crisis mode.
</P>
<P>
   One option considered at the first emergency meeting was a joke:
``Change countries.'' But the company's directors _ computer
whizzes from Moscow State University who founded Galatica in the
early days of Soviet economic reform _ were searching for a more
realistic response.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, they considered a get-tough approach. Threatening
letters were sent out to clients, warning them that Galatica would
cut off consulting services to companies that did not pay their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   But like other attempts at breaking through the wall of Russian
arrears, this bluff fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was so tough that we backed off,'' Chernikh said.
``At that point we decided that if the country is in bad shape and
our clients are in bad shape, we would just have to suffer, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Looming largest of all is the mountain of unpaid bills that have
accumulated as companies, private and government, run out of money
to pay each other, their workers or their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a thriving trade in debts. At the end of 1996,
overdue debts constituted one third of all accounts payable to
enterprises, forcing producers to rely on barter for their
commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   As the government moves to tighten monetary policy further, even
less money is available, particularly for businesses like Galatica
that offer services that many of its customers _ caught in a
squeeze between newly aggressive tax collectors and angry unpaid
workers _ consider low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies anywhere are vulnerable to sudden financial
shifts, but in Russia, the small-business sector _ much of which
exists below the radar of government data collectors _ is
particularly exposed, lacking both access to credit and the
protection of a well-developed system for bankruptcy and other
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   For most Russian businesses, borrowing money from local banks is
not feasible, given the continuing rise in interest rates, which
were already at punishing levels of about 40 percent a year for
short-term loans before the crisis hit. According to one recent
report, credits to the private sector in Russia amount to only 7
percent of gross domestic product, compared with 15 percent in
Poland, 24 percent in Hungary or 111 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For small companies like Galatica, which employs almost 500
people in offices scattered around the former Soviet Union, seeking
investors through a public offering of shares is not realistic
either, particularly now with the uncertainties that cloud Russian
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis deepens, many are predicting that more and more
Russian companies, small and large, are going to have to scale back
already pared down operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether people have access to bank loans, there
is a single pool of capital,'' said Edwin Dolan, president of the
Moscow-based American Institute of Business and Economics, which
offers a master's degree in business administration. ``The
tightening of monetary policy is going to affect access to working
capital, which in turn tightens the nonpayment crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Galatica's strategy has been to look beyond its big clients in
Russia's energy sector _ which have been hit hard by a drop in
world energy prices _ and focus on more stable sectors, like
retailing and food processing, which have more direct links to
consumers. It has been helped by a recent merger with Parus,
another Russian software company that built up a diverse clientele,
and by its operations outside Russia, in former Soviet states like
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with financial crises is not a new challenge for
Galatica, which also saw payments grind to a halt in the period
before the 1996 presidential elections. Then Russia's money supply
dried up dramatically for several months as foreign investors,
fearing a Communist victory, stayed away, and as the Russian
government drained its budget to help President Boris Yeltsin's
re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, the crisis was much bigger than now,'' Chernikh said.
``Then people stopped paying altogether. But each passing crisis is
a little less alarming. It is like gunfire. The first time is
frightening, the next time a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after a boom year in 1997 when sales more than
tripled, Galatica's directors are relatively sanguine about their
ability to survive without layoffs or major restructuring. Even a
devaluation of the ruble, which to most analysts would be the
worst-case scenario for the Russian economy, might not so
devastating. For one thing, noted Chernikh, Galatica has always set
its prices in dollars, a practice that dates back to the early
1990s when the value of the ruble was being whipped by inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when the company developed its first program to help
companies manage their resources, Galatica has geared its
management programs to reflect the way their clients actually do
business, not the way they should according to Western business
school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   From Soviet-style bookkeeping to barter transactions, Chernikh
says Galtica's programs have kept up with Russia's reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western companies solve their problems very differently from
Russian companies,'' he said. ``Here, for instance, a contract is
not a contract in the Western sense. It can change during
implementation, which is something we have taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   From its beginnings as an entreprising team from Moscow State
University's prestigious mechanical and mathematics department then
operating on the outer edges of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's first economic reforms, the company has had the
advantage of direct experience with Russia's lurching progress
towards a market economy, even as it kept close ties with the wave
of Russian ``computershiki'' who emigrated in the late 1980s to
Silicon Valley in California.
</P>
<P>
   An important break came in 1988 when Galatica won the contract
to computerize the electronic voting at the Congress of People's
Deputies, an elected gathering that was to usher in political
reform to the Soviet Union. But its biggest advantage was to be one
of the first on what was then an empty playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time in Russia, you could do something in Russia
without money,'' Chernikh said. ``Now it is already more
complicated. The importance of having a name, a reputation, has
much more meaning now than it did even five years ago, and that
requires more money up front.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A record regular-season crowd is expected at the Astrodome tonight,
and it has nothing to do with the Atlanta Braves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Mac isn't in town, either.
</P>
<P>
   Slammin' Sammy is a week away.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some tall guy is pitching,'' wisecracked third baseman Sean
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Houston just got a lot bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson makes his Astrodome debut at 7:05 p.m. against the
Philadelphia Phillies in what is expected to generate the most
interest by an individual player since Nolan Ryan's first game with
the Astros in 1980. The Astrodome record for a baseball game is
53,688, set Oct. 3, 1997, in Game 3 of the National League playoffs
against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 53,657 attended an exhibition between the Astros and
Texas Rangers on April 2, 1993. Ryan started for the Rangers in his
first trip to the Dome since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone has been ringing off the hook for tickets,'' Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   If infielder Tim Bogar didn't have one of the best seats in the
house, he would pay to watch Johnson, acquired in a trade with the
Seattle Mariners on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are he would be unable to find a ticket. As of 5
p.m. Thursday, only 6,200 tickets remained. The Astros had sold
27,000 tickets for tonight's game prior to the Johnson trade and
reported selling close to 16,000 during a three-day stretch this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd definitely pay to watch Randy pitch any day of the week,
even if I had to sit at the top (of the Dome),'' Bogar said. ``He's
one of the best pitchers in the game, if not the best.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros, all the attention is taking some getting used
to. A swarm of national and local media converged on Pittsburgh for
Johnson's debut Sunday, a 6-2 victory over the Pirates in which he
struck out 12 in seven innings. Such interest in Houston usually is
reserved for Mark McGwire's batting practice or a series with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But a regular-season game?
</P>
<P>
   Against the 56-57 Phillies?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually the other team having part of the attraction,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``It's like a playoff
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The May 16 Astros-Braves game drew a regular-season-record
51,526. Prior to this season, the largest regular-season crowd was
June 22, 1966, when 50,908 watched Sandy Koufax pitch for the Los
Angeles Dodgers. The Astros have drawn 1,397,665 for 52 home dates
this season, an average of 26,878.
</P>
<P>
   A placard welcoming Johnson with a ``K'' (for strikeout) will be
distributed to fans as they enter the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The adrenalin) is going to be flowing more for the fans,''
Berry said. ``If he gets more people in the stands, wouldn't you
rather play in front of a packed house? I'd much rather play in New
York in front of 60,000 screaming idiots than play in front of
5,000 screaming idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans are anxious for a glimpse of the hard-throwing,
6-10 lefthander, and Johnson said the feeling is mutual. In 1989,
he made a trip to the Astrodome as a Montreal Expo but did not
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a pitcher's park,'' said Johnson, 34, the American
League Cy Young Award winner in 1995. ``I'm looking forward to
pitching there and pitching in front of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio realizes much of the excitement is
generated by Johnson but said it doesn't hurt that the Astros
(68-46) hold a 4{-game lead in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think it's a combination of Randy pitching and the
team playing well,'' Biggio said. ``The crowds for the rest of the
year should be some pretty good ones in my eyes. There shouldn't be
a reason not to see some huge crowds the rest of the season at home
games _ even during the middle of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr., who purchased the team in 1993,
said the level of excitement surrounding Johnson's arrival is
similar to Ryan's return, last year's division-clinching game
against the Chicago Cubs and the divisional playoff with Atlanta _
the first postseason baseball game in Houston since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's captured the imagination of the fans,'' McLane said.
``They idolize Nolan Ryan and love Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell.
But no one can dominate a game like a pitcher. He can just
electrify the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And motivate a clubhouse. Many of the Astros stayed up past last
Friday's non-waiver trading deadline and understandably were
shocked when the news of the Johnson trade went public. First-round
playoff outcasts a year ago, the Astros suddenly were being
mentioned in the same breath as the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Come October, Johnson's impact could go beyond the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got Randy, the expectations went up,'' Bogar said. ``I
think they (the fans) expected us to make the playoffs, but now
they expect us to do something. This is the first chance for
everybody to see Randy pitch, so I can understand the excitement. I
hope after two weeks it doesn't go away.''

   Game with Italy opens &QL; 
medal-contention play
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Until now, the proving ground for the U.S.
basketball team has been confined to its locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But now that these replacement players for the Dream Team have
convinced themselves they have what it takes to succeed in the FIBA
World Championship of Basketball, they would like to let a few
people know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, U.S. fans who have ignored this event. One victory today
would get everybody's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States enters the quarterfinal round against Italy
(9:30 a.m. CDT), and the intensity goes up several notches. The
winner will be one of four teams trying for the gold medal. The
loser is out of medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for every team, it's pressure,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said Thursday. ``For us, what these guys have done is amazing.
Nobody expected them to do anything. Nobody even knows about them
in the U.S. It's not a big story, although it's starting to become
more and more of a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all important games, but this next game erases all
that wonderful work (if they lose). We know what we've done. We're
proud of what we've done. But back in the United States, if we lose
this next game, they'd say, `Ah, they just failed.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But these guys really haven't failed on what they've done so
far. We know that. We've already surpassed some expectations. But
we'd like other people back in America to feel good about this
team, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a big game. We want to be going for the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   This is turning into a let's-prove-everybody-wrong tournament
for the U.S. squad, which was thrown together less than a month ago
and yet went 5-1 in the first two rounds against national teams
that have played together for years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is the No. 1 seed out of its half of the bracket.
It plays Italy, which squeaked into the quarterfinals as the No. 4
seed from the other bracket. The winner today plays the
Lithuania-Russia winner Saturday in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us getting the No. 1 seed and getting to where we
expected ourselves to be is a good compliment to this team,'' Jimmy
King said. ``A lot of people thought we weren't able to get even to
this spot. Our goal isn't over. But we're on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the games really count. In order for us to get into the
medal round, we have to beat Italy. I don't really feel like we're
under any pressure. I feel like we're the No. 1 seed. We earned
that, and the pressure of getting it is off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've answered some questions. But if we lose, there's going
to be a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of which would be: Why did the NBA players cost
America the gold medal by not playing in these games?
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans don't want to dwell on that possibility. They
face an Italian team they beat 80-75 in an exhibition in Rome just
before this tournament. But Italy is the only team to have a win
against powerful Yugoslavia, the pre-tournament favorite. So the
Italians have the ability to beat anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, a team we struggled to beat in an
exhibition game,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But to me, that game means
nothing. This is the real deal, and I'm expecting a real hard
game.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be nothing but hard games the rest of the way. The
remaining eight teams can make a case that they will win the gold.
And the Americans face a double whammy, to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are not the Dream Team of NBA players, they are not
as strong and their presence has created the wide-open feeling of a
tournament that has no clear-cut favorite, not even the
Yugoslavians.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the world would be humiliated if it were beaten
by what is essentially America's minor-leaguers. The U.S. players,
on the other hand, recognize this is a chance to show the world
that American basketball is so strong and so deep, it can handle
other countries' strongest competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, we've gone as far as we can go,'' David Wood
said. ``If we're going to go on from here, we have to do it as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good about our situation is that we've had serious
pressure on us from day one. So it's not going to be any different
now. It was pressure just making this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faith that it's our destiny to win the gold. Of
course, every event I've ever played in, I have had faith that we
were going to win. But this is a great door of opportunity opened
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take faith and a lot more in this case. The Americans
aren't invincible, but neither are they intimidated by the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't fear anyone,'' point guard Michael Hawkins said.
``But it's funny. We've worked so hard and accomplished a lot as a
team. And now, it's all riding on this one game right here as to
whether we go to the medal round or not.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tomjanovich said: ``Talk means nothing now. Playing the game
means everything. That's why we're here. And I'll say this: This
(vying for the gold) is much more rewarding than it would have been
with the NBA players. We're right in the pack with everybody else,
and if we happen to do this, it's a tremendous feat.'' &QL;

AFTER YET ANOTHER BULLPEN COLLAPSE, METS RALLY TO DEFEAT GIANTS,
9-8  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Mets have demonstrated anything over the last
week, it is that no late-inning lead truly seems safe when they're
playing, regardless of who happens to be ahead. Sometimes that
benefits the Mets, and sometimes it doesn't, and Thursday afternoon
at Shea Stadium served as a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in the last seven games, the Mets'
precarious bullpen collapsed, this time by blowing a 6-2
eighth-inning lead over the San Francisco Giants. And yet for the
second time in three days, the Mets displayed resiliency by
rallying for the victory, with the winning run again coming
courtesy of a bases-loaded walk from Giants reliever Jose Mesa,
this time with Luis Lopez at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-8 victory, before a crowd of 36,920, left the Mets with a
60-52 record, two and a half games behind the Chicago Cubs in the
National League wild-card race. It also enabled the Mets to depart
on a nine-game road trip that begins in Denver Friday night feeling
relatively good about themselves, even though Met relievers Dennis
Cook and Greg McMichael each managed to give up three-run homers in
the eighth inning Thursday as the Mets bullpen continued its
remarkable week of self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good for the goose,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
after happily watching another team's relievers blow a lead. ``We
were the gander.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa walked Luis Lopez on a 3-1 with none out in the bottom of
the ninth to score Matt Franco with the winning run. It capped a
two-run rally that began with John Olerud (who had earlier extended
his hitting streak to 20 games) singling off San Francisco closer
Robb Nen, who had entered the game with no outs in the eighth to
squelch an earlier Mets uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Franco was the last available hitter on the Mets' bench and he
followed Olerud's hit with a pinch-hit single to right that moved
Olerud to third. And then Brian McRae tied the score, 8-8, with a
run-scoring single to center as Franco took third on the play.
</P>
<P>
   After McRae, who had earlier tied his career high with his 17th
home run, took second on defensive indifference, Nen intentionally
walked Lenny Harris to load the bases. On came Mesa, who had walked
Harris with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 10th
on Tuesday to give the Mets a 7-6 victory in a game in which they
had handed away a two-run lead in the top of the ninth. Lopez,
mindful of what happened Tuesday, said he was determined to take
two strikes from Mesa before he ever took the bat off his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Lopez never swung.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to swing, it had to be right down the middle,'' Lopez
said. ``He was all over the place. It was kind of a flashback to
the other night.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Mets seemed to have been playing the same game
over and over for the last week, the way they were either blowing
apparently safe leads or frantically rallying for victories. There
were bad bullpen losses to the Dodgers on Friday and Monday, and
dramatic victories by the Mets in their final at-bat Saturday,
Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's victory also included three hits by the struggling
Todd Hundley, which had to make everyone on the Mets feel a little
more confident. But at the same time, the latest bullpen failure
has to leave Valentine wondering when, and if, his relief corps
will ever get straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Mets have now blown 26
save opportunities this season, while converting just 25. Thursday,
Masato Yoshii pitched well enough to win for the fourth consecutive
time. After allowing two first-inning runs on three hits, the
Japanese right-hander allowed just two more hits over the next six
innings, as the Mets rode a three-run homer from Edgardo Alfonzo
off Orel Hershiser and solo shots by McRae, Tony Phillips and John
Olerud to a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the top of the eighth. Cook, on in relief of
Yoshii, surrendered a three-run homer to former Met Jeff Kent on
his very first pitch to trim the lead to 6-5. Cook got the next two
batters out but then surrendered a single to Rich Aurilia and a
double to Brent Mayne. On came McMichael, who had allowed five runs
and two homers in two-thirds of an inning on Monday night. This
time, he immediately surrendered a three-run pinch-hit home run to
the former Yankee Charlie Hayes, giving the Giants an 8-6 lead. The
Mets got one run back in the bottom of the eighth and had the tying
run on third when Nen struck out Tony Phillips, the only time
Phillips, who had four hits on the day, made an out in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (4-0) then came on in the top of the ninth and
narrowly escaped a bases-loaded jam of his own escaping unscathed
by striking out Aurilia and Mayne on fast balls. Wendell had been
something of an afterthought in the bullpen, but he pitched two
strong innings against the Giants on Tuesday and just might start
to take on a bigger role in a bullpen in which McMichael and John
Franco and Mel Rojas and even the relatively consistent Cook have
plenty of recent scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these were all rookies and they had no stripes, I'd be
really concerned,'' Valentine said of his bullpen. ``But they've
all been through a few wars. They know how to right themselves.
These have been the two worst weeks of pitching and I think we're
something like 13-5 (actually, 14-6). That's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, after watching his team rally for an emotional
victory in what has become a see-saw season, Valentine did not want
to talk about anything bad.

A MODEL CAREER PATH FOR A SELF-STARTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cesar Pacheco III of the South Bronx recalls vividly
the day that Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered _ June 12, 1994. He
nearly lost his life the same evening, after being shot point-blank
in the chest during a botched robbery outside his apartment in the
Castle Hill section. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching the New York Knicks in a playoff game that
night, as he had planned, Pacheco spent nearly nine hours on the
operating table at Jacobi Hospital, while his fiancee and her
6-year-old son waited anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   For a time it was touch-and-go, as the Jacobi surgical team
repaired his perforated lung, diaphragm and liver. ``You owe us
one,'' a surgeon later told Pacheco, then 23. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A near-death experience, Pacheco says, focuses the mind
wonderfully. During his slow recovery, while contemplating the
hundred or so stitches that held together the tapestry of his body,
he decided that it was time to get his act together, too.
</P>
<P>
   He had graduated from an alternative high school in the South
Bronx and held a string of low-paying odd jobs. That wouldn't do,
not with a family to support. Pacheco wanted a career. But in what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking was the obvious choice,'' he now says, though when he
decided to become an operator of 18-wheelers, he didn't own a car,
much less know how to drive a truck. Still, having been raised near
the Hunt's Point Market in the Bronx, Pacheco grew up watching the
big rigs maneuver in and out of the industrial neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once back on his feet, he applied for a learner's permit and
persuaded a friend to provide some informal lessons in driving a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was Model Training Center on 14th Street in
Manhattan. No fly-by-night diploma mill, the vocational school has
been in business for 50 years. After six weeks of instruction,
Pacheco had a commercial driver's license; now, he was certified to
drive everything from ambulettes, city buses and garbage trucks to
flatbeds and triple tractor-trailers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks later, he was hired by MS Carriers of Memphis,
at $1,000 a week plus overtime, benefits and bonuses. In other
words, good money, particularly for someone who until then had
never earned more than $350 a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a career self-starter, Pacheco is in many ways representative
of a new mode of working in America. Employees and entrepreneurs
find happy niches for themselves by following their instincts _ and
expect to reinvent themselves several more times before retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Even today's college graduates often tumble into careers very
different from the ones they have just finished training for. And
many workers are eagerly jumping into jobs that did not exist even
a year or two ago _ corporate Web site managers, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco drove tractor trailers professionally for just two years
before he had his second epiphany. It was at the funeral of a
36-year-old friend who had a heart attack during a basketball game.
The friend had two young children, and his death made Pacheco
realize that he wanted to spend more time with his family _ he now
had two children, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved driving across the country because it allowed me to
see that there was more out there than what was in front of me in
the South Bronx,'' Pacheco said. ``But I think it's more important
for kids in a ghetto atmosphere to have a full-time father
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The week after his friend's funeral, Pacheco, then 26, was back
at the Model Training School, this time offering his services as a
driving instructor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has turned out to be a satisfying career switch. Part of the
payoff, he said, comes from helping others gain access to a better
standard of living. Salaries for truck drivers range from $35,000
to $100,000 and can come with good benefits _ especially jobs
covered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Neither a
high school diploma nor proficient English is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach immigrants who were making $5 an hour as dishwashers
and even a lot of college graduates who are sick of making eight
bucks an hour in an office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend found Pacheco busy training a 47-year-old man, a
meat packer who has been with the Pathmark grocery chain for two
decades, to drive a rig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have trouble understanding that just because a guy
didn't go to Harvard Business School doesn't mean that he doesn't
have dreams,'' he said, identifying strongly with his student.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do you need an MBA to see how things fit together in the
economy. From the cab of his big rig, Pacheco became his own
securities analyst. While he had never heard of Peter Lynch, the
legendary portfolio manager for Fidelity Investments, he approached
the market as if he had memorized a page out of Lynch's playbook:
Invest in what you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking gives you an excellent idea of what's happening in
different businesses through watching the flow of traffic,'' he
explained. In July 1995, for example, he noticed that an
extraordinary amount of goods was being delivered to the loading
docks of Sears, Roebuck stores across the country, and he figured
that meant an extraordinary amount of merchandise was being carried
out the front door by customers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   His observation was keen: Sears stock, which had been
languishing in the low $30s, started to move; by the next March it
had climbed more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Pacheco was ready to invest for the long term, he
selected MCI Communications and Sun Microsystems _ stocks that he
hopes will help pay for the education of his two boys, now 10 and
3. His plan, for now at least, is to set himself up in the trucking
business when his boys are a little older.
</P>
<P>
   For about $25,000 you can buy a secondhand rig and go into
business for yourself, Pacheco explained. He would also like to buy
a home in Westchester County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might not be the first thing to come to mind, but there are a
lot of dreams to be realized by driving trucks. Currently, there
are about 80,000 unfilled driving jobs in the industry, Traffic
World magazine has reported. And given the surge in ordering goods
by catalogue and from the Internet, it is no surprise that the
government says trucking is the eighth-fastest-growing occupation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk out this door after a $365, 10-day course, and
another $175 for the road test, and get a job tomorrow,'' said Bob
Kousoulos, a longtime instructor at Model Training Center. ``You'll
make back the cost of the class in a week.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, after a year and a half on the job, Pacheco is
regarded by the school's owners as one of their top instructors. He
makes about $42,000 a year teaching others how to handle big rigs.
What about the bonus he used to collect as a driver? ``Seeing my
family every day is my big bonus,'' he said.

BANKS AND CREDIT-CARD ISSUERS ARE RAISING THEIR LIMITS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Thomsen, a financial consultant in suburban Washington,
actively uses two credit cards, sometimes piling substantial
business expenses onto them. No matter how much he spends, though,
his Visa and Mastercard issuers keep automatically raising his
authorized credit limits, which now run well into five figures
each.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is to tempt people like Thomsen _ a
customer with a good payment record _ to borrow ever-higher amounts
at interest rates that often approach 20 percent. But for some
consumers, it also means a chance to get into ever-bigger financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Do not count Thomsen, 55, among the less-disciplined consumers;
he usually pays off his card balances in full at the end of each
month and has never asked for more borrowing power. Indeed, he
said, ``I've never bumped up against a credit limit.''
</P>
<P>
   In watching those limits grow, however, Thomsen has plenty of
company these days. Banks and other credit-card issuers are raising
their limits far faster than consumers are borrowing _ even as
lenders report record proportions of delinquencies and charge-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite protestations that they're trying to get rid of the
worst excesses, the marketing of card credit is continuing largely
as usual, with little let-up,'' said Warren Heller, research
director for Veribanc Inc., which rates banks and savings
institutions. ``One of the time-tested rules of business is that
your existing customers are your best prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two years ended in March, credit limits for all
bank-issued cards in the United States soared 50.3 percent, to
$1.78 trillion, according to Veribanc _ more than twice the growth
in card charges.
</P>
<P>
   This pushed consumers' potential spending power to a record 8.3
times their current indebtedness, up from 5.7 just two years ago.
When the data were first collected in 1990, the multiple was a
little more than 2.
</P>
<P>
   Other figures, compiled by the American Bankers Association,
also point to fast-expanding credit. The most common credit limit
for a standard card sponsored by a large bank, the association
said, climbed for the second consecutive year in 1997, to $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   That is 40 percent higher than the typical limit of $2,500 in
1993. And some ``premium'' cards _ which are not all that difficult
to get _ are being advertised with limits of $50,000 and even
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The average account balance on standard credit cards issued by
large banks is $1,987, the survey found, up from $1,479 in 1993.
For gold cards, it is $2,497, up from $2,334.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America sponsored a report on the
subject last month to bolster its opposition to a bill making it
harder for people to declare bankruptcy _ a bill that lenders are
pushing for Congress to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The organization attributes soaring bankruptcies largely to
``irresponsible'' promotion of credit cards and considers the
banking industry hypocritical in seeking legislation that they say
would make it easier to collect debts from consumers whom bankers
themselves had lured over the financial brink.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, increasingly dominated by a shrinking number of
major banks, often responds to such accusations by saying that
soaring credit lines are a statistical illusion or a reflection of
banks' improving ability to differentiate between the most
lucrative customers and potential deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Chimerine, consulting economist for Mastercard
International, estimated that 75 percent to 80 percent of the
increase in total credit lines reflected the issuance of new cards
_ for which no reliable count exists _ rather than expanded
capacity for existing card holders.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, MBNA, the second-biggest card issuer after Citibank,
added 11.4 million customers last year on top of a 9.3 million gain
in 1996. But some in the industry say that to hasten that growth,
MBNA engages in mass expansion of credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Frank, a spokesman for MBNA, disputed this, saying that
the company's lines have grown an average of just 8 percent in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   At First Chicago NBD, which issues the First Card, potential new
card holders are offered lower lines of credit than they were two
years ago, said Ralph R. Mueller, senior credit officer for First
Card.
</P>
<P>
   First Chicago attributes the growth of credit limits to the
issuance of more gold and platinum cards, which have higher limits.
It also notes that many card holders now have more cards to use;
according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit card
industry, the average is now slightly more than four cards per card
holder, compared with slightly more than three in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, the industry attributes the expansion of credit
limits to refined methods of judging their new customers' ability
to pay. Banks have become ``much more adept in distinguishing the
most profitable customers, those most likely to use their cards and
repay their balances,'' said Robert Stock, senior vice president
for credit products at Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that issuers have reduced their exposure to new
credit-card charge-offs, what risks can expanded credit limits pose
for consumers? An obvious one is that a generally responsible
borrower could leap into expensive debt because of an emergency _ a
serious health problem, for example, or the loss of a job.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists say high credit lines pose some risks even if
they are not used. Access to other credit, like a mortgage, can be
impaired if an applicant has too many cards with too much borrowing
potential. Lenders are wary that a consumer or spouse could
suddenly tap several credit sources so heavily that not all could
be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is taken into consideration,'' said Charlotte Newton,
vice president for consumer affairs at Mastercard. ``Whether or not
you use it, it's still there.''

HOME REBUILDING POLICIES THAT OFFER 120 PERCENT OF INSURED AMOUNT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ill., Md.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM COAST, Fla. _ The wildfires that swept through the piney
woods here this summer provided a test, of sorts, of a new kind of
home insurance that is being introduced gradually across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying whatever it takes to replace a destroyed home,
as had been the case for years, the leading insurers are now
selling policies that limit most payments to 120 percent of the
insured amount.
</P>
<P>
   And that has posed a powerful question: Would the scaled-back
coverage be enough for people to start over? Would there be huge
gaps between the cost of a new house and the insurance payment?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, based on evidence accumulating here, is that the
lesser coverage seems to suffice. Both the insurers and Florida
regulators say there have been no complaints and, in nearly a dozen
interviews, people who lost their homes had nothing but praise for
the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't ask for better treatment,'' said Aida Meltzer, an
Allstate customer who lost her three-bedroom home here in central
Florida, near the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Many fire victims have collected more than they expected, and
those who have come up short say they have only themselves to blame
because they consciously under-insured their homes, taking what
they thought was a reasonable gamble that disaster was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making the restricted policies work, consumer
advocates and insurers say, is in accurately calculating the cost
of rebuilding a home and then scrupulously adjusting each year for
inflation and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach requires much more vigilance,'' said J. Robert
Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of
America. But done according to plan, he said, it seems fair to both
customers and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's new approach, which requires regulatory approval
in every state, has yet to be tested in the aftermath of a big
hurricane or earthquake, when laws of supply and demand _ as well
as profiteering _ can send rebuilding costs soaring off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida fires, the number of homes lost was not enormous,
and prices for building materials seem to have changed little.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers also say they do not foresee problems in areas where
real estate values are skyrocketing, because coverage is based on
the cost of rebuilding rather than on a house's market value. A big
part of a house's sale price often reflects the value of the land
on which it was built. But homeowner's insurance covers the house,
not the site.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers introduced sky's-the-limit policies in the early 1980s
as a way to increase sales. But soon they became the industry
standard, so no company had an edge. The insurers did have much
greater liability, however.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew cost the industry $16 billion in 1992, and
State Farm took the first step toward retrenchment the next spring,
refusing to sell unlimited policies in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it instituted the 120-percent provision. Judith K.
Mintel, a lawyer for State Farm, says the intent is to insure
accurately the cost of replacing a house. State Farm allows for a
10 percent margin of error in its estimate system, she said, and
throws in another 10 percent for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that the concept was workable, the company began
putting it into effect nationally in 1996, as state regulators
approved it. And the competition has followed. The policies, which
cost about the same as their predecessors, are now being sold in
more than 30 states, including California. The new approach has yet
to be approved by regulators in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say that they sent notices to customers about the
changes and that they instructed their agents to spread the word,
but details of the coverage apparently were lost on many people.
Fire victims here said they did not realize _ until claims
adjusters told them _ that they could get up to 20 percent more
than the amount their policies specified.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, they also couldn't recall a time of unlimited
coverage. Without exception, they believed that if they were
insured for $100,000, they could expect $100,000 _ no more, no
less.
</P>
<P>
   They were also happily surprised to learn that they would
receive several thousand dollars, in most cases, to remove the
remains of their homes and for new landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   By spreading money around immediately, the insurers won many
friends in Palm Coast, which has a population of about 30,000,
scattered over hundreds of acres of thick woods a few miles from
the beach. Within hours of the fires in July, the insurers were
handing out thousands of dollars for living expenses; within a few
days, many people had received checks for the face value of their
policies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Rhon Dixon, the owner of a window-blind and kitchen-cabinet
company, drove up to the knee-high mound of ash that had been his
two-story, three-bedroom frame house, he found a State Farm claims
adjuster sitting in his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Do you need some living expenses?' '' Dixon
recalled. ``I said, `Probably.' And he said, `What do you need,
$5,000, $10,000?' I said $10,000 would be fine. Then, about three
minutes later, he said: `You're going to need a deposit for where
you're living. Why don't I just give you $15,000?' And I said,
`That's even better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until the fires, Dixon had never expected to use his insurance.
He said he had guessed at what might be enough coverage and didn't
aim high. He never read his policy and doesn't remember anyone
telling him about the 20 percent cushion or other provisions that
will now put money in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think your property is worth a lot, but when you talk with
the tax people and the insurance company, you try to claim it's not
worth anything,'' Dixon said. ``Until something like this happens
it just seems like you just keep paying and never get anything
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Dixon, 42, has been talking with contractors about
rebuilding. Their calculations show his coverage was low. His
policy was for $108,900; rebuilding will cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault,'' Dixon said. ``I didn't have it insured for
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap, though, is not going to be as wide as he first thought.
State Farm has already given him $21,700 more _ the 20 percent,
plus $1,300 for things like replacing his driveway, sidewalk and a
patio. And he expects State Farm to supply an additional $5,000 to
bulldoze and cart away his ruins and about $5,400 more for new
landscaping. Changes in building codes have increased some building
costs, and State Farm routinely pays a percentage of those
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A more litigious person might argue that Dixon's State Farm
agent should have made an effort to see that the insured value of
the house was closer to the mark. Executives at State Farm
headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., said that their policy is for
agents, armed with the latest costs of building materials and a
computer, to estimate as precisely as possible how much it will
take to replace each house they insure. Dixon said the only
estimate he knew of came out of his head.
</P>
<P>
   James I. Jones, 62, who got out of his house just as his trees
were catching fire, was also under-insured. He thought his agent's
estimate of $100,000 of coverage was low, but didn't argue: he did
not want to pay higher premiums. Now that concrete block walls are
all that remain of his three-bedroom home, he also blames himself,
not State Farm. Jones says two contractors have estimated the cost
of replacing his home at $135,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Florida fire victims said their biggest insurance
mistake was underestimating the value of their furniture, clothes
and the other contents of their homes. An Allstate homeowner's
policy automatically provides the equivalent of half the face value
for the home's contents; on a $100,000 policy, the contents are
covered for an additional $50,000. State Farm's automatic
allocation is 75 percent of the face value.
</P>
<P>
   Aida and David Meltzer, retirees from Baltimore, were among
those whose insurance coverage worked out just right. They did not
cut corners and fastidiously updated their coverage. When they
added a room to their beige-and-brown ranch house in mid-May, Mrs.
Meltzer increased their Allstate coverage by $10,000, to about
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, the Meltzers found it would cost about $85,000
to rebuild, well within the 20 percent margin. They have even
decided to add a few frills out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very well satisfied with the insurance company and all the
people we've had to deal with,'' Meltzer said.

 DEMOLITION FIRM CITED IN COLLAPSE OF 42nd ST. BUILDING  
 (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As investigators continued to look into the deadly
scaffolding collapse at a Times Square construction site, they
announced Thursday that a nearby building's collapse in December
was caused by a demolition company's failure to shore up a
construction site on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the 80-year-old Selwyn Theater building, which
happened amid a spate of similar accidents in Manhattan, disrupted
preparations for the city's New Year's Eve celebration in Times
Square and reinforced worries about the city's aging buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The company found at fault, Big Apple Wrecking &AMP; Construction
Corp. of the Bronx, had filed plans with the Buildings Department
last year detailing how it would underpin the Selywn building while
it excavated a construction site next door to build E Walk, a large
retail and entertainment complex. But according to a report
released Thursday by the Buildings Department, Big Apple never
provided the steel and concrete underpinning, or any bracing that
would have held in place the dirt and rock beneath the building.
Instead, the report says, the Selwyn building slid off its
foundation and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation has concluded that the collapse was due to
the failure of the subcontractor to follow through on the approved
plans,'' said Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the city's system of ``semi-controlled inspections,'' the
demolition contractor is responsible for insuring that demolition
and excavation work on the site comply with the construction plans
approved by the Department of Buildings. The city does not inspect
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Big Apple, a large demolition company with a troubled history,
was a subcontractor for Tishman Construction Corp. at the E-Walk
complex. Big Apple president Harold Greenberg did not return calls
seeking comment. In an unrelated case a decade ago, Greenberg was
convicted of bribing a federal inspector to overlook violations in
an asbestos-removal project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings Thursday, Silva said there was little he
could do to punish Big Apple, which was involved in a similar
collapse six years ago at the Ansonia Post Office near Lincoln
Center. The Buildings Department expects to cite Big Apple for
several violations relating to the collapse, which could cost the
company several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't license demolition contractors, that's all we
can do,'' Silva said. ``This reinforces the need for a licensing
scheme for contractors in the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani submitted legislation
to the City Council that would require the licensing of
construction companies. The licenses could be revoked if a company
failed to comply with regulations or had a pattern of unsafe
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A call for the licensing of contractors was issued in 1992, when
a portion of the Ansonia Post Office collapsed on Broadway, between
67th and 68th Streets, injuring a passer-by. At the time, a
Buildings Department official said the cause of the Ansonia
collapse appeared to be ``improper demolition procedures and
careless supervision'' by Big Apple, which had already been cited
for 10 safety violations at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State Development Corp. and the 42nd Street
Development Project, which own the Selwyn building, have filed a
claim for millions of dollars against the construction manager,
Tishman Construction Corp., which hired Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman is also the construction manager at the Conde Nast
construction site at nearby Broadway and 43rd Street, where a
scaffolding collapse in July killed an elderly woman and prompted
the city to cordon off several blocks in the area. That accident is
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Empire chairman Charles Gargano said Thursday that he was
seeking to recover the costs related to cleaning up the debris from
the Selwyn collapse, as well as the costs associated with building
a 10-story rehearsal studio and theater on the site of the Selwyn
building.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman spokesman Richard Kielar said that both his company and
Big Apple were ``in discussions about resolution of the state's
claims.'' He said that Big Apple and its engineer were responsible
for creating a safety plan and adhering to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication in the report that Tishman or its
associated entities on the project were at fault, or did not
fulfill all required procedures,'' Kielar said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following a beer-bottle-strewn trail of evidence and
the recollections of an eyewitness, the dogged detectives on the
case of the purloined Peter Pan Thursday found the missing statue
50 feet below the surface of the East River near Gracie Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the disappearance of the beloved statue from
Carl Schurz Park appeared, appropriately enough, to be the work of
a band of overly high-spirited youths, perhaps latter-day Lost Boys
who turned on their own icon.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief Kevin Farrell, the commander of Manhattan
detectives, said the police believed that the crime stemmed from a
party that took place in the park on Tuesday night just a few steps
away from the official residence of New York City's crime-busting
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence under examination, he said, ``including beer
bottles'' near the park's walkway where the nearly five-foot-tall
bronze statue was thrown into the river.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had identified no suspects, but clearly
several strong people were needed to drag the statue and its
pedestal from the garden, cut or wrench the statue free from the
base, carry it up a flight of stairs and heave it over a chest-high
fence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 officers were involved in recovering the statue,
Farrell said, including a half-dozen scuba divers at a time working
50 feet down in the murky, silty river. For much of the morning,
police details, including small craft resembling lobster boats from
the Harbor Unit, trucks from Emergency Services bristling with
esoteric gear and clumps of grim-faced supervisors in dark suits
ranged up and down the shore from the Heliport at East 60th Street
to an old boathouse just north of the mayor's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The statue was winched into one of the small boats _ it took a
700-pound counterweight to pull it up _ and finally taken to the
police facility at Rodmans Neck in the Bronx to be examined for
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visually, it looks pretty good,'' said Farrell, adding that
the only apparent damage was a scrape on one knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dets. John R. Flannery and Patrick O'Donnell had spent most of
Wednesday prowling through scrap metal dealer's shops in the Bronx
on the possibility that the statue might have been chopped up and
sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the two detectives decided to make another canvass of the
park at night, hoping to find a visitor who might have been there
when the statue was stolen. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   A man who took his nightly constitutional along the river
opposite East 87th Street told them he had seen a group of eight or
nine young men, possibly teen-agers, Flannery said, ``carrying an
inanimate object.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard one yell, `No-no-no,' and then he heard the splash,''
the detective said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Launch 37 of the Police Scuba Unit anchored
just off the park to begin the search. Sgt. John Cummings and
Officer Frank Pelligrino tossed a line with a grappling hook went
into the murky waters and followed it in their masks and fins to
begin what they call a pendulum search. After only 20 minutes they
found the statue on the silty bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great eyewitness,'' Pelligrino said. ``It was right
where he said it would be. It's pretty complex, but if you have a
good eyewitness, that's half the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the statue was only the beginning. The water was calm
when they started, but in the hour it took to get the statue
winched aboard Harbor George's Launch 4, the current was ripping
hard through Hellgate at 4 knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very brutal environment, a very dangerous dive,''
Pelligrino said of the stretch of river off the park. ``There's
lots of rebars, debris; its like a junkyard of garbage down there.
It's definitely very dangerous, a black water environment. Your
visibility is very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, the more experienced diver, began tying lines around
the statue, running them around and through its arms and legs. The
visibility was so bad they had actually tied it to a 10-foot rebar
and had to pull it free. Then they hooked three baloonlike lift
bags to the statue to give it boyancy and the harbor unit boat
pulled it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty tricky job,'' Pelligrino said.
</P>
<P>
   A Parks Department spokesman, asked about the condition of the
statue, said that orders had been issued that statements about
Peter Pan would come only from the mayor's press office.
</P>
<P>
   At city hall, Giuliani mentioned the recovery in response to a
question about the disappearance of Irene Silverman, a wealthy
widow. ``No,'' he said, ``but I should tell you that Peter Pan has
been discovered in the East River.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding irked at the attention the statuenapping had received,
and perhaps because all the news reports noted that it occurred
near Gracie Mansion, Giuliani added: ``I usually like to confine
myself to reporting on things that happen to human beings. I tend
to think the more important incidents are the ones that happen to
human beings. But the statue was found.''

 &HT;    Wohlers taking 10-day trip to minors as Braves shuffle pen
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the starting rotation remains the most rock-solid in the
major leagues, the Atlanta bullpen is still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   A day after signing two veteran relievers to minor-league
contracts, the Braves were set to make more roster moves Thursday
involving the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a cortisone shot for bone spurs in his pitching
elbow Thursday, middle reliever Russ Springer was expected to go on
the disabled list following Thursday night's game with Cincinnati.
Mark Wohlers, who has lost his control and closer's job but pitched
encouragingly Wednesday, agreed to a second assignment to Class AAA
Richmond. But for only 10 days, not 15.
</P>
<P>
   With the club flying to San Francisco immediately after
Thursday's game for tonight's start of a nine-game West Coast road
trip, Braves officials were still deciding which Richmond pitchers
would take Springer's and Wohlers' roster spots. One possibility:
Mike Cather, who was optioned to Richmond July 15. Cather was out
last week with an inflamed tendon but was scheduled to work an
inning Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Three Richmond relievers who won't make the jump: Pedro Borbon,
whose rehabilitation assignment there was extended Wednesday for
another 15 days, through Aug. 20; and right-hander Paul Wagner and
left-hander Norm Charlton, both signed Wednesday and assigned to
Richmond. Wagner and his 7.11 ERA were released by Milwaukee late
last month; Charlton (2-1, 6.94) was released July 28 by Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from Richmond July 15 after a special assignment
to try to regain his control, Wohlers had struggled badly yet said
he wouldn't accept another minor-league assignment. But after
pitching better Wednesday (walking Barry Larkin after just missing
low with a 3-2 fastball, then striking out Dmitri Young), Wohlers
agreed to go down to Richmond for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go and pitch,'' said Wohlers, ``but I don't need to
be gone for 15 days.''
</P>
<P>
   With Springer out, though, manager Bobby Cox couldn't afford to
risk going to the West Coast short one pitcher. Not the way Wohlers
has pitched the last three weeks, when he hasn't been able to get
through an inning, causing Cox to burn another reliever each time
Wohlers pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, meanwhile, was again in pain after a bad outing
Wednesday. Entering the ninth inning with the score tied 9-9,
Springer lasted two-thirds of an inning, gave up four hits and two
walks and was charged with four earned runs and the loss. On
Thursday, he was examined by team orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler, who
X-rayed bone spurs on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically just wanted to see if the spurs were still
attached to the elbow. They were,'' said Springer, who had a couple
of spurs removed from the same place (the back of the elbow, where
the triceps meets the elbow) in late October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   These spurs began bothering him about two months before the
All-Star break, while he was still with Arizona. Springer was on
anti-inflammatory medicine there, just like he is here. Springer
got a cortisone shot Thursday and had planned to rest two days,
resume light tossing and then throw from a mound Tuesday in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't gonna feel one way or the other until I see how this
cortisone works,'' said Springer. ``Right now, I'm not doing
anybody _ the team or me _ any good.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Springer had hoped to avoid the DL, his elbow,
Wohlers' situation and the road trip necessitated that move. And
others.
</P>
<P>
   Go West
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to scheduling problems due to expansion and interleague
play, this is Atlanta's only West Coast trip of the year. ``It's
been so long, seems like we haven't been out to California in five
years,'' said Cox. ``Interleague, interleague, interleague did it.
We always enjoy going to California, always been a pleasurable
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip is more business, with San Diego leading the NL West
and battling the Braves for the best record in the league; and San
Francisco contending for the NL wild card. Even Los Angeles has
wild card hopes. After this trip, those three teams come to Atlanta
for seven games. That's 16 straight games against one, and perhaps
two, teams the Braves could see in the post-season. Time for an
October preview?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes any difference,'' Cox said. ``You can
only see a team so many times. I guess there's a little advantage
for both teams, but who knows? The Cubbies are the wild card team
right now and we were finished with them two months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an important road trip for us,'' said Chipper
Jones. ``We could play these teams in the playoffs. It's important
to get that mental edge against them, if there is such a thing. A
lot of people think the Padres, us and the Astros are the three
best teams in the National League. When we go to San Diego, we want
to be at the top of our game.''

 &HT;    Klesko swinging back into form
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Cat always seems to carry a big smile rivaled only by
his size. Of late, Andres Galarraga has had good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday's game, he was on a 10-for-23 surge amid an
eight-game hitting streak, which grew to nine games with a
sixth-inning home run, his 34th. But that wasn't all.
</P>
<P>
   The smile was for the guy who hits behind him, Ryan Klesko, who
is hitting .352 with seven homers and 27 RBIs in his last 35 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially good for the team,'' Galarraga said. ``But
it's a big help for me because I'm not seeing many good pitches
right now. More protection on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko sat out against left-hander Mike Remlinger, but in the
first inning of Wednesday night's game against the Reds, he gave
Galarraga and two other teammates tickets home via his 16th homer
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Klesko's second homer since he returned to the roster
July 12. He missed nine games after having his appendix removed on
June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the arthroscopic surgery, Klesko had a torrid month in
which he hit .382 with five homers and 16 RBIs. Klesko also raised
his batting average, which had been a season-low .236 on June 2, to
.271. Since his return, he has remained a pain in the side for
opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Andres got here, (Klesko) was the bomber of the team,''
catcher Javy Lopez said. ``We all knew that sooner or later, he was
going to produce. We were just waiting for him to wake up. He's
doing it at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko concedes he was a tad sluggish when he came back, but
feels he's at full strength now. His average is up to .284.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling pretty good,'' Klesko said. ``I'm up to par
... getting back in the swing of things.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the old swing-and-miss. This season Klesko has only 42
strikeouts in 310 at-bats. In 137 more at-bats last year, he
whiffed a team-high 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, I'm always hungry. Sometimes I'm too
aggressive,'' Klesko said. ``The difference has been my pitch
selection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys who never stops working,'' said hitting
coach Clarence Jones. ``He's doing great and that's a plus for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves prepare for their first and only trip of the
season to California for nine games, the native of Orange County,
Calif., is looking forward to more than facing his West Coast foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, most of my relatives are out there,'' Klesko said. ``We
get a day off, too. Me and some of the guys are going yellowtail
fishing in San Diego. It ought to be fun.''

 &HT;    Gore unities Florida Democratic party
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fragile truce within the Democratic Party is being attempted
today with the hope that Lt.Gov. Buddy MacKay will finally get an
endorsement from U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   A private ``unity meeting'' with Hastings, MacKay and Vice
President Al Gore and about 25 others is scheduled for 2:30 this
afternoon at the Fort Lauderdale Sheraton. That meeting will be
followed by Gore's appearance at a money raising event for the
Florida Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The unity meeting, orchestrated by Hasting, D-Miramar, may be
anything but unified. Some black members of the Florida House of
Representatives resent Hastings' aggressive attacks on black
leaders and what they perceive as his interference in state
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some black lawmakers also complained that they were not invited
to the meeting with Gore and believe Hastings was slighting them.
As a result, there may be a second meeting between Gore and black
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Support from Hastings and other black leaders would be an
important political moment for MacKay. The Democratic nominee for
governor has little chance of defeating Republican nominee Jeb Bush
without overwhelming support from black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Few wanted to talk openly about today's meetings describing the
situation as ``volatile'' and ``unsettled.'' There was even a fear
that Hastings could, at the last minute, change his mind about
endorsing MacKay if MacKay doesn't give blacks a larger role in the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MacKay will begin broadcasting his first campaign
commercial on Monday in West Palm Beach, Miami and other markets.
Frontrunner Bush has been on the air for weeks and MacKay's
campaign hopes the commericials will help close the gap.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CLAIM `WITCH HUNT' BY ALASKA REP. DON YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
 HUNT-ALLEGED-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Don Young, the powerful chairman of the House
Resources Committee, wants to know if federal employees ``are
members of'' or ``have any contact with'' Arizona environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists blasted the move as a ``witch hunt,'' and
likened it to the 1950s-era efforts of Sen. Joseph McCarthy to
search for communists in the ranks of government.
</P>
<P>
   Young's attempt to connect federal employees to environmental
groups is contained in a letter to the Southwest regional office of
the U.S. Forest Service. The letter stemmed from a congressional
hearing last month into the federal Endangered Species Act and how
it is being administered in Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hansen, a spokesman for Young's committee, said Young and
others don't believe they received complete or accurate answers
from U.S. Forest Service officials. He said an investigation is
being made into allegations that federal employees illegally leaked
federal documents to environmental groups and that those documents
later were used in lawsuits against the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he could not comment whether these were
congressional investigations or criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said Young's letter already is having a
``chilling effect'' on federal employees' ability to uphold the law
and communicate with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Don Young is the Joe McCarthy of the 1990s. Anyone who
stands up for the environment, Don Young brings to his knees,''
said Sam Hitt, president of the Santa Fe-based Forest Guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt's group, along with the Southwest Center for Biological
Diversity, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society are among the
groups mentioned in Young's July 28 letter to Eleanor Towns,
recently named by the Clinton administration as regional forester
for the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Young, R-Alaska, ordered Towns to respond to 19 questions by
Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Forest Service regional office in Albuquerque were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Young's committee staff wants to know details of
an agreement reached in April between the Forest Service and
environmental groups that calls for removing cattle from hundreds
of miles of rivers and streams in the Southwest in an effort to
save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said there are allegations that the Forest Service acted
in a biased manner in favor of the environmentalists and against
ranchers in reaching the agreement, which partially settled a
federal lawsuit brought by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations being investigated, Hansen said, are:
``that there had been contact prior to the (court) hearing, deals
had been made, certain parties had been excluded, so they went into
it as a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Hitt's charges of McCarthyism, Hansen said, ``If he
is insinuating that environmentalists are like communists, ... I
have no control over his thinking process. But it's pretty clear
that anybody and everybody who has done nothing wrong here is
sleeping fine tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said federal employees should be concerned ``if there has
been this free-flow of documents in lawsuits against the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Young's letter to the Forest Service was leaked to
the media is an example of how freely the information moves, Hansen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Galvin, conservation biologists for the Southwest Center
for Biological Diversity, said environmentalists are sent documents
from a wide variety of government agencies by employees who are
frustrated over their agencies' failure to uphold the Endangered
Species Act and other environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, these employees are beating their heads agains
the wall. The agencies are stacked with corrupt or gutless
bureaucrats,'' said Galvin, whose groups plans today to file yet
another lawsuit against the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The latest lawsuit, to be filed in U.S. District Court in
Tucson, alleges that the Forest Service failed to protect five
endangered species _ Gila topminnow, lesser long-nosed bat, cactus
ferruginous pygmy owl, Huachuca water umbel and Yaqui chub _ by
allowing excessive livestock grazing across the Coronado National
Forest in southern and southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is similar to the one that resulted in April's
agreement between the Forest Service and environmental groups that
affected 60 ranchers in central and eastern Arizona and parts of
New Mexico. &QL;

<P>
   The career of Michelle Smith, the Irish swimmer who won three
gold medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics, appeared to end in
disgrace Thursday when swimming's world governing body banned her
from competition for four years after finding that she had
manipulated a drug test by spiking her urine sample with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she won her Olympic races in Atlanta and was
congratulated in person by President Clinton, suspicions arose
about the authenticity of Smith's performances, given that her
times had improved dramatically late in her career. Suspicion
continued to grow after Smith failed to appear for at least one
drug test following the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's announcement was shattering in Ireland, where
Smith had become a heroine as the country's first woman to win an
Olympic gold medal. Now she has become of most accomplished
athletes ever to be banned in a drug scandal. Her case is also
noteworthy because it is relatively rare for an athlete to be
caught cheating by tampering with a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Her banishment follows a long list of suspensions for Chinese
female swimmers and is the latest in a series of drug scandals that
have staggered Olympic-related sports this summer. The scandals
have prompted the International Olympic Committee to call for a
worldwide drug summit next January in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that someone who has competed on such a
high level would be in this situation, but you've got to compete
with integrity and it's important to train with integrity,'' said
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, the first woman to be selected as a
vice president of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, DeFrantz will attend a meeting of the IOC's
executive board in Lausanne, at which time plans will begin for a
reappraisal of the Olympic committee's drug-testing policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wish is that we can find ways to make certain that sport at
all levels is both safe and fair for the athletes,'' DeFrantz said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last January 10, Smith was given an unannounced drug test in
Dublin as part of an out-of-competition doping control program
administered by FINA, swimming's world governing body. Random,
out-of-competition testing is considered a more reliable way to
catch cheating athletes, who are more likely to beat announced
tests taken at major competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Her sample, tested in a Barcelona laboratory accredited by the
IOC, was found to have ``unequivocal signs of adulteration,''
according to the lab report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the concentration of alcohol present in the
sample ``is in no way compatible with human consumption'' and that
the sample showed ``a very strong whiskey odor.''
</P>
<P>
   A second test on Smith's urine sample was performed on May 21
and the results were compatible with the January test, according to
FINA. At a hearing on July 24, a federation doping panel found that
the sample had been manipulated in an uncertain manner by Smith and
not by the laboratory, the collectors or the transporters of the
sample.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Smith was banned from national and international
competition for four years, which makes her ineligible for the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. It is highly unlikely that
Smith, now 28, would be able to remain in competitive form for the
2004 Summer Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Drug experts suspect that the use of a substance such as alcohol
to manipulate a drug sample is an attempt to mask the use of
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has continued to maintain that she does not use
performance-enhancing drugs. Neither she nor her attorney commented
on Thursday's banishment, but Smith is scheduled to hold a news
conference Friday in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   She has said previously that she would appeal any ban to the
Swiss-based International Court of Arbitration for Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swimmer stressed that no banned substance had been
detected in her urine,'' FINA said of Smith, referring to her
presence at the July 24 doping panel hearing. ``She asserts that
from her side there was no physical manipulation of the sample.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's suspension is part of an embarrassing summer for sport
that saw the world's top cycling team was thrown out of the Tour de
France for the systematic use of EPO, a substance which increases
oxygen-carrying capacity. And last week, two other Olympic gold
medalists from the United States _ the 1996 shot put champion Randy
Barnes and the 1992 4x100-meter relay member Dennis Mitchell _ were
suspended by track and field's world governing body for possible
doping offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, American swimmers and coaches said they thought that
Smith's ban was a sign that FINA's assertive new doping control
program was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think FINA is doing the right thing with its out of
competition testing program,'' Carol Zaleski, president of the
United States Swimming Federation, said in an interview.
``Obviously people who are using things they shouldn't are most
likely to be caught there rather than in a competitive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Games, Janet Evans, along with other American
coaches and swimmers, questioned the legitimacy of Smith's
performances because she had moved to the top of international
competition at a relatively late age and after a mediocre career.
For instance, she was not ranked among the top 25 swimmers at any
distance, for any stroke, as late as 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Further suspicions were raised by the fact that her husband,
Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower, had been suspended by track
and field's world governing body for excessive levels of
testosterone, the male sex hormone that can also be used as a
muscle-building steroid. Both Smith and her husband said that her
performances were improved by weight lifting and by using the
training techniques of track and field athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all the rumors; I tried to keep an open mind,''
Zaleski said. ``At that point, everything was circumstantial. The
fact that her urine sample was manipulated gives credence to those
suspicions. The kind of improvement she showed a couple of years
prior to the Olympics, based on her age, was extremely unusual. The
coaching community was up in arms about her. But, again, there was
no proof of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin Thursday, Jim McDaid, Ireland's sports minister, said
that Smith's ban was a ``personal tragedy for the swimmer and her
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the rest of the Irish people, I'm saddened and
disappointed by this development,'' McDaid said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish swimming federation said it accepted FINA's ruling,
pending the outcome of an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this is the first case of a drug-related penalty in the
104-year history of Irish swimming, it is the source of major
concern to everyone in the Irish swimming community,'' the
statement said.

CHIEF OF ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Lester Alberthal Jr., under pressure from board members
and shareholders to turn a faltering Electronic Data Systems
around, has resigned as chairman and chief executive, the company
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The board plans to recruit an outsider to lead the company,
whose shares and prospects have dropped since a spinoff from
General Motors in 1996. Until then, Alberthal, only the company's
second leader after its founder, Ross Perot, had succeeded in
multiplying its sales and profits around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Alberthal has become the latest of several corporate chiefs
to resign this year after performance suffered and board members
grew restive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, refusing to make Alberthal or any other board
members available for interviews, said that he was leaving for
personal and professional reasons in no way related to the
company's fortunes or board or shareholder discontent. ``His
decision to retire was voluntary,'' said Cecilia Stubbs Norwood, a
company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But conversations between board members and major shareholders
came to figure in Alberthal's resignation, people briefed on or
involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, EDS has lost its lead in the computer services
industry to IBM. In an increasingly competitive market, several
major contracts have proved less profitable than anticipated _
among them its business with GM, which remains by far its largest
customer.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees Retirement System, known as
Calpers, included EDS on its 1998 list of the nation's worst
corporate performers. In May, the fund's proposal to have Alberthal
hand over his chairmanship to an independent director, though
remaining as chief executive, won 21 percent of shareholder votes.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pacheco, a fund spokesman, said he was encouraged by the
announcement of Alberthal's resignation, made after the stock
market closed. ``It's definitely time for new leadership at the
helm of EDS,'' Pacheco said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors pension fund voted against the Calpers
proposal, but its representatives discreetly communicated their own
misgivings to the board, according to a person involved in these
discussions. The fund has been reducing its EDS holdings, and now
has about a 26 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal installed the board himself when EDS split from GM.
Calpers questioned whether those board members could exercise true
oversight, noting that five of the 11, including James Baker III,
the former secretary of state, either work for or do business with
the company. Although Baker's law firm serves EDS, the company has
said that Baker does not.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the board's governance committee, however, Baker
appeared to take the lead in questioning the company's management.
In the company's statement Thursday, Baker thanked Alberthal for
his service and for agreeing to stay and take part in the search
for his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal, 54, joined EDS 30 years ago as a systems engineer.
Perot sold the company to GM for $2.55 billion in 1984, and
Alberthal took over as chief executive two years later and became
chairman in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The special class of stock that GM issued to track EDS'
performance yielded vast gains. But since their peak of $63.375 in
October 1996, EDS shares have fallen to a close of $36.6875
Thursday.

PREDICTABLY, TALKS BREAK DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCURDIE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- After less than two hours at the
bargaining table Thursday, representatives of the NBA's players and
owners decided to break for lunch. Apparently, all that talk about
salary caps, Bird exceptions and ``basketball-related income'' can
work up quite an appetite.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sides returned from their respective Manhattan
eateries, indigestion set in. Commissioner David Stern was suddenly
so overcome that he left the room.
</P>
<P>
   And, predictably, the day ended with the players and owners no
closer to a new agreement than they were on June 22, when a similar
meeting broke off after all of 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockout rolls on, with no bolt cutters in sight.
</P>
<P>
   What were you expecting? A breakthrough? In August? Not with the
kind of money at stake here. If you believe the doom and gloom
that's been projected by both sides, we could still be waiting for
meaningful progress on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and a group of owners that included the Lakers' Jerry Buss
walked out of Thursday's meeting after representatives of the
players' union outlined a proposal that included no provisions to
reel in the ever-escalating growth of player salaries, at least for
those at the top of the pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the walkout was met with disdain by some of
the dozen or so NBA players in attendance. Those included Utah Jazz
forward Karl Malone, who took a break from his busy summer on the
pro wrestling circuit to sit in on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have told them anything and they would have walked
out,'' Malone said. ``If I hadn't been here, I would not have
believed this. It's hard to believe someone is taking their ball
and going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the kid with the ball, said he was mildly encouraged by
the tenor of the meeting's morning session. ``We thought some hair
was let down, and that people were talking rather than posturing,''
he said in a conference call with reporters late Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been nice while it lasted. But the first sit-down
session between the sides since June 22 ended abruptly, shortly
after the lunch break, when players' union attorney Jeffrey Kessler
informed the owners that they are in danger of losing on an unfair
labor practices charge filed to the National Labor Relations board,
and on a ruling to be handed down by arbitrator John Feerick on
whether approximately 220 players with guaranteed contracts should
be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, there was no point in letting our owners respond,''
Stern said, ``because the words they were using were insulting and
patronizing. We felt the better part of valor was to end the
session, rather than have it deteriorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, executive director of the players' union,
intimated that Stern's indignation was ``feigned,'' that the
walkout was choreographed for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Said Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner and chief
operation officer: ``What went on in their lunch to cause them to
shift gears, we don't know. We can only surmise that their counsel
told them, `You don't want to do anything constructive until you
play out the legal string.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, all of this might be interpreted as a sign of
progress. Real negotiations in professional sports labor relations
matters don't truly begin until talks ``break down'' a time or two,
and the name-calling starts.
</P>
<P>
   The core issues here are, of course, money, money and money.
</P>
<P>
   The owners claim they are devoting approximately 57 percent of
their basketball-related income to player salaries, and they want a
deal that reduces that number. They think the way to do that is to
eliminate the so-called ``Larry Bird exception'' to the league's
salary cap, which allows teams to re-sign their free agents without
regard to the cap, and by a system that doesn't permit rookies to
become free agents after only three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The players say they are united in wanting the lucrative Bird
exception to remain in place, and has proposed a plan that would
give teams right of first refusal for players at the end of the
three-year contracts they sign as rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the players' representatives indicated they may be
agreeable to including ``appropriate marijuana provisions'' into a
new agreement. That qualifies as some progress. But don't expect
the pace of these talks to quicken anytime soon, especially with
the way Thursday's session ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened by this,'' Stern said. ``I know that we'll be
sitting down to make a deal at some point. It's just a question of
how much damage will be done (by then).''

MOTHER CHARGED WITH MURDER DECADES AFTER CHILDRENS' DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (changes 2nd sentence of 7th graf to clarify why state cannot seek
death penalty. No other changes.)  (js) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Endless tragedy had cast Marie Noe as a martyr,
the cheated mother who had endured the death of 10 sons and
daughters, one by one. It was a fate almost too cruel to be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Jay Feinschi argued
that Mrs. Noe was, instead, ``as much a mass murderer as Ted
Bundy'' and said that the court should show her no mercy. Mrs. Noe,
69, who was accused this week of murdering eight of her infant
children from 1949 to 1968, was denied bail.
</P>
<P>
   Life Magazine featured the woman who lives on North American
Street and her millworker husband, Arthur, as emblems of tragedy in
1963, after six of their children had died. The first baby was
stillborn. The second died hours after birth at the hospital. The
other eight infants went home healthy, but none lived longer than
14 months. Most of the mysteries were eventually attributed to crib
death, now called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
</P>
<P>
   ``This case involves a great American tragedy,'' District
Attorney Lynne Abraham said. Ms. Abraham said Mrs. Noe had
confessed to the police to killing four of the children, and had
told police she could not recall the circumstances of the other
deaths. Her husband, 77, was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had suspected foul play for years, but had not found
proof, said Halbert Fillinger, the coroner of Montgomery County,
who worked in the Philadelphia medical examiner's office in the
1960s and helped conduct autopsies on some of the Noe babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One SIDS death is a tragedy,'' he said. ``Two is a mystery.
Three is murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said the eight children had been smothered with a
pillow or another soft object. The state cannot seek the death
penalty because the deaths happened before the death penalty law
was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Noes had taken out nominal life insurance
policies on some of the children, but that was not seen as a motive
for the killings. Ms. Abraham said evidence of a motive would be
shown at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said that when each of the eight children died, Mrs.
Noe was alone at home with the child. She said Mrs. Noe would
sometimes call a neighbor for help, saying, ``Something's wrong
with the baby.'' Each of the children was pronounced dead on
arrival at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Perlman, a pediatrician who treated one of the Noe
children, Constance, in 1958, had run extensive tests on the
newborn because of the earlier unexplained deaths and found nothing
abnormal, a police affidavit in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   When Perlman told Mrs. Noe that she had a beautiful child,
according to the police affidavit, Mrs. Noe replied, ``She's not
going to live . . . just like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Noe's old working-class neighborhood of row houses in the
Kensington section, most people interviewed expressed shock over
the charges. In the living room of the Noe's home, two doors away
from the row house where they lived when the children died, is a
framed photograph of one of their children, Catherine Ellen, a
10-week old who died in February 1966.
</P>
<P>
   David Rudenstein, a lawyer for Mrs. Noe, told reporters on
Wednesday that police had coerced the statement by grilling Mrs.
Noe, who is diabetic and was not feeling well, throughout the night
for a total of 11 hours.

   ``I am appalled at the way this case has been handled,'' said
Rudenstein, who said that Mrs. Noe had told police she wanted to
call a lawyer, but that they ignored her. ``They intimated that if
you sign this, you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he found it ``inconceivable'' that Mrs. Noe would
keep the killings a secret for nearly a half-century, then suddenly
acknowledge committing murder to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstein also accused the district attorney's office of
looking for ``a big splash of a case.'' He indicated that Mrs. Noe
would plead not guilty at her preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsies of the Noe children were studied by Dr. Stephen
Ludwig, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in
Philadelphia, who concluded that the deaths were caused by
suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said medical authorities in the 1950s and 1960s were
reluctant to make accusations against parents in cases of crib
death. But he said that the ``medical community has now
acknowledged that one of the provable explanations for SIDS is
really infanticide,'' the police affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham said the case was ``a wake-up call'' to police
officers and health workers to be vigilant in such cases. She said
several factors had prompted her to pursue the investigation,
including the book, The Death of Innocents, published in 1997,
which examined the case of a New York State woman convicted of
murder in 1994 for killing her five children two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Noe children all died at home. When questioned after
the death of a seven-month-old daughter, Mary Lee, in 1963, Mrs.
Noe told police that she had left the baby in the crib for a few
minutes and returned to find the child ``gasping for breath and
turning blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Noe, who worked in textile mills and later became a
Democratic committeeman, told the Philadelphia Daily News, in an
article published in January, that he was still burdened by the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to see is this thing brought up
again,'' he said. ``It brings up all the pain and troubles and
heartaches. Maybe it's news to others, but it's pain to us.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending months of anticipation with a resigned
shrug, Monica Lewinsky, the former intern, walked into a federal
courthouse here Thursday and testified that she and President
Clinton carried on a sexual affair within the White House, a lawyer
familiar with her account said.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony before a federal grand jury, which contradicted a
previous sworn statement, tightened the legal and political vise
around President Clinton. The president denied a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky under oath in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit, and he has denied it as well to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified to several sexual encounters with Clinton
in his small, private study down a short hallway from the Oval
Office, the lawyer said. As expected, she also testified that she
and the president had talked about ways to conceal their
relationship, the lawyer said, but she also said that he never
directly told her to lie under oath in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent prosecutor, is
investigating accusations that Clinton lied under oath and
obstructed justice by trying to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months of waiting for Ms. Lewinsky to tell her
story ended just before 8:30 a.m., when she stepped from a dark
green Toyota Land Cruiser, embraced a lawyer, shrugged and vanished
inside. As portable generators rumbled in the background and one
cameraman swept the scene from a cherrypicker 50 feet over Third
Street, about 20 satellite trucks beamed images of Ms. Lewinsky _
once an unpaid, anonymous sorter of White House mail _ around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, answered questions in exchange for immunity
from prosecution for any wrongdoing she describes. In a deal worked
out with prosecutors nine days ago, she is vulnerable to
prosecution only if she lies in her testimony. In an affidavit on
Jan. 7 in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky swore that she did not have
a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's described her six and a half
hours before the grand jury as grueling. ``She was asked very
specific questions about very private matters which are very hard
to discuss in public,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky has agonized for months over the prospect
of damaging Clinton's presidency, friends have said. One of her
friends described Ms. Lewinsky as saying Wednesday night, as she
prepared for her testimony, ``What I'm doing tomorrow is something
I never ever wanted to do. It breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a media mob after Ms. Lewinsky completed her testimony,
her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said that she answered questions from
prosecutors and jurors ``truthfully, completely and honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal finally
appears to be coming to an end,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never publicly described his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky in any detail, beyond saying that it was not sexual.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In a capital whipsawed between disclosure and denial, starkly
different days unspooled at the federal courthouse and the White
House. Summoning the authority and trappings of his office, as well
as his own storied political resilience, President Clinton went
about his official duties Thursday without betraying a hint of
interest in his former intern's testimony just a few blocks down
Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this day for quite a long time,''
Clinton said in one speech at a Washington hotel, referring to his
opportunity to address a White House conference on building
economic self-improvement in Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president appeared before a row of
uniformed police officers in the sun-gilded Rose Garden to call for
a permanent five-day waiting period for people seeking to buy
handguns. With a quick left-handed salute after the official
remarks, the president cued a brassy Marine band to strike up
``Stars and Stripes Forever.'' Reporters waiting to shout questions
about Ms. Lewinsky were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, provided the official
reaction to the testimony. ``The president has not expressed any
views to us on this,'' he said, ``except we know that he does agree
with us _ and probably all Americans _ that if this means that
we're coming to the end of this four-year, over $40 million
investigation, then that would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their restraint, White House advisers telephoned
reporters late this evening to ask what they knew of Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Ms. Lewinsky's version of her relationship with
the president was still in doubt. But Starr's investigation has
rushed forward since then, with her immunity agreement and
Clinton's own promise to testify at the White House on Aug. 17. In
striking the deal with Starr, Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a navy
blue dress that prosecutors have sent for testing by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. They are trying to determine if the dress
contained physical evidence of a sexual encounter with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was asked a series of questions about the dress
Thursday. Prosecutors have left open the possibility of recalling
Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury, perhaps after the president
testifies.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-January, Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the
president has been the stuff of fevered speculation in the news
media and tawdry late-night comedy. She herself has remained in
virtual isolation, cautioned by her lawyers not to speak to anyone
outside her family.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from across the country and around the world converged
on the courthouse Thursday, clucking over the spectacle and
contributing to it at the same time. Some reporters began claiming
choice spots as early as Wednesday evening for a glimpse of Ms.
Lewinsky _ only to be flummoxed Thursday morning as she took an
unexpected route through the courthouse, up to the third floor in
an elevator reserved for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as passers-by stopped to take in the scene, scores of
photographers lined up for a shot of her. When George Hancock, a
supporter of Ms. Lewinsky's from Bowling Green, Ky., tried to raise
his yellow sign wishing her luck, he cut off their line of sight.
``You wave that sign again,'' shouted one cameraman, ``I'll kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducking out of view, Hancock was surrounded moments later by
reporters and photographers, some of whom berated him while others
tried to interview him. ``How's it make you feel, buddy?'' Dominic
Mumeka, 33, murmured as if to himself as he stood off to one side.
``This is your 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumeka, who cleans a taxi depot, said he had dropped by to watch
history be made. ``There hasn't been anything like this since
Watergate, and before that since Andrew Johnson, 1869,'' he said.
But, he asked, ``Can a guy really get impeached for going to bed
with someone?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the passers-by drawn to the drama Thursday expressed
irritation at the news media's panting pursuit of the story. As
reporters and bystanders pushed and shoved for position at Ms.
Smith's brief appearance late this afternoon, one cameraman
snapped: ``All you damn spectators can see it on TV. We have to be
here so you can watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jeckanowski, a 28-year-old economist, shot back: ``You
cause all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has resolutely refused to question Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility publicly. But fragmentary accounts have
emerged that White House officials were concerned that she had a
crush on the president.
</P>
<P>
   An Indianapolis lawyer who has worked as a Democratic operative
said in an interview Thursday that he had been asked to keep an eye
on Ms. Lewinsky at an Oct. 23, 1996, fund-raiser at the Sheraton
Hotel here to ensure that she did not ``embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sullivan, a lobbyist and lawyer from Indianapolis, said
that he was asked by a friend, Regan Burke, to keep an eye on Ms.
Lewinsky because she had recently left the White House and there
were concerns she was ``disgruntled.'' Ms. Burke works at the
Department of Education and was unavailable for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `We don't know if she has fantasized a relationship
with the president,''' Sullivan recalled Thursday. ``But she keeps
showing up at these events.''
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Sullivan said that he stood behind Ms.
Lewinsky on the rope line and chatted with her briefly. As Clinton
began shaking hands with supporters, Sullivan said, he watched Ms.
Lewinsky reach out with both hands to hug the president. ``And he
hugged her back,'' he said. ``Then he said to her, `How are you
doing?' She said, `Fine.' He said, `How's your new job?' And she
said, `Great.' He said, `I wish you the best of luck,' and that was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he spoke on Monday with a CBS television station
in Indianapolis about what he had seen. In a sign that the White
House is following up any lead to bolster Clinton's story, Sullivan
said that on Wednesday David E. Kendall, the president's personal
lawyer, called him to ask a number of questions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt no pressure by anyone to tell his story
publicly.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day is warm, the news conference regarding a
mother and son who are suspects in a probable murder case is dying
down, and on a bench opposite state Supreme Court in Manhattan a
wino is dozing.
</P>
<P>
   It's the time of day, in short, for the private investigator to
make an admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told _ not by my kids _ that I'm not as warm and
affectionate and demonstrative as they would like me to be,'' says
Les Levine, the lead defense investigator in the Kimes case,
chatting on a park bench. ``I'm not a flowery guy. I don't squeeze
people and tell them I love them. But people who know me refer to
me as a rough, tough pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   A pussycat? A guy who hunts down drug dealers and roots through
garbage to find evidence and wears a wire? Pussycat?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the rough, tough part,'' Levine says. ``I've been known
to sit there in the courtroom and have tears streaming down when
the guilty verdict comes in. I was very upset when Marv Albert made
his guilty plea. Very upset, very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps this tenderness that explains some of Levine's
remarks regarding Sante and Kenneth Kimes, the mother and son who
are the prime suspects in the disappearance of Irene Silverman, a
wealthy New York widow. Levine, retained by their lawyer, Mel
Sachs, has suggested that there are other suspects police have
overlooked and that he will find them. He has also been telling the
press that ``everybody has enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kimes is very pleasant, very personable, a very caring
mother,'' he said outside the courthouse this week, where mother
and son pleaded not guilty to credit card fraud. ``Her son appears
to be a very decent kid. There are other people that my office is
looking to, that perhaps have much greater motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Kimeses have Mrs. Silverman's passport in their
possession at the time they were arrested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oft-times people who work for me or my lady friends have my
passport in their possession _ that's one scenario,'' Levine says.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of private detectives whom the city's top
crime lawyers turn to in a high-profile case. Les Levine _ who
refuses to reveal his age (he looks as if he's in his late 50s) or
his fee ($150 or $175 an hour, depending on the case, according to
a lawyer he has billed) _ is one. A firm believer in the importance
of image, he drives a white Jaguar with a phone, a billy club and
LES PI plates.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has worked for the defense teams of Marv Albert, the art
dealer Alec Wildenstein, and a Columbia graduate student, Oliver
Jovanovic, who was convicted of sexually abusing a Barnard student
he met on the Internet. Levine's work on the Peter Gatien case,
which resulted in the nightclub owner's acquittal on drug charges,
has been praised by defense lawyers around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the gift of gab, getting people to confide in
you,'' says Benjamin Brafman, who defended Gatien. ``Les is a
likable person, he has good people skills. He can be what you what
him to be: tough, creative, talented, soft-spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Others feel Levine gabs too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some slimeball private investigators,'' says Beau
Dietl, a former New York homicide detective who now has his own
investigation company. ``Les does not have a slimeball reputation.
But you got to do a full investigation on somebody before you can
say they're innocent. To say this old lady had a lot of enemies _
she's 82, how many enemies can she have? Her grocery delivery boy
if she didn't give him a tip?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the sort of remark likely to bother Levine, who
seems to have been cheerfully immune from criticism since his
youth. Raised in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, the son of a jeweler
and a housewife, Levine graduated from New York University but was
never particularly interested in school: Ask him what he majored in
and he cannot remember.
</P>
<P>
   Levine spent five years in his father's jewelry business,
because he did not want to disappoint him, but then fled because he
could not bear working behind a desk. He joined a collection agency
owned by two private investigators, and stayed with the company as
it expanded into an equipment-recovery firm. There was money in,
say, tracking stolen shipping containers, but not much
satisfaction. Levine took the test for a private investigator's
license and went into business.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first assignments was to investigate the credibility
of the model Marla Hanson, whose face had been slashed on the order
of a man she had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repugnant as this sounds, I looked into Marla Hanson's
background to see if she was not the image she portrayed,'' Levine
says, in a rare admission of the rough nature of his work.
</P>
<P>
   How does he live with that sort of thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I do,'' Levine says. ``I would much rather go after
the background of the victim than say I didn't give everything to
the client and the attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine has told reporters that he intends to find out what has
happened to Mrs. Silverman, the missing widow. Is Levine aware that
people are comparing that remark to O.J. Simpson's statement that
he would find Nicole Simpson's killer?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Levine says. ``Twelve people believed it.
That's not a slight factor.''
</P>

SELLERS OF CONTRABAND CUBAN CIGARS ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Fla., N.J.)  (js) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking aim at outlaw cigar aficionados, federal
officials have charged the operators of a high-end restaurant and a
private club in Manhattan with selling illicit Cuban cigars to
customers, and on Thursday four other men were also arrested on
cigar-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, federal agents armed with search warrants seized
hundreds of boxes of cigars from the walk-in humidors of the
Patroon restaurant on East 46th Street and the Racquet and Tennis
Club on Park Avenue. A federal spokesman put their value at several
hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gressler, a manager at the men-only Racquet and Tennis
Club, and Alex Hasbany, manager of the cigar room at Patroon, were
arrested and charged with conspiring to violate the Trading With
the Enemy Act by buying and selling cigars made in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Aretsky, the owner of Patroon, surrendered in federal
court Thursday and was also charged with violating the trading act.
Aretsky, a former owner of the restaurant 21, declined comment
about the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The four others arrested on Thursday _ identified as Kenneth
Joseph, 44; Laurence Zimmerman, an investor for whom no age was
available; John Steinhardt, 44; and Edward Marron, a 52-year-old
investment banker _ were released on their own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes no sense,'' said Michael Kennedy, a lawyer for
Joseph, who is chief executive of W.H. Industries, a privately held
manufacturer of automotive parts in Northvale, N.J. ``It is both
absurd and arcane to think that an individual American who buys a
cigar from another American can be arrested for trading with the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cigar-lovers also bristled in response to the prosecutions,
terming the raids a publicity stunt. ``In a time when there aren't
enough agents to go after drug dealers, it seems ridiculous that
they have the manpower to chase down Cuban cigars, when it's just a
matter of time before the embargo against Cuba is lifted,'' said
Mark Grossich, owner of the Cigar Bar at Beekman Bar and Books and
two other cigar-friendly bars in Manhattan. ``Castro isn't going to
be in power forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the prosecutions followed six other systematic
efforts by customs agents to stem the spread of Cuban cigars: four
in Florida, one in California and one in the District of Columbia.
In April, customs officials began investigating the shipment of
Cuban cigars to an address in Connecticut, where they found lists
of clients, including businesses and private clubs, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to customs officials, 240,523 Cuban cigars worth an
estimated $3.1 million _ or $12.99 per cigar _ were seized in the
United States in 1997, more than double the 96,216 cigars seized in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The importation of Cuban cigars is a felony under federal law;
an exception can be made for cigars worth less than $100 that are
brought in their luggage by travelers arriving directly from Cuba.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, almost since the United States imposed a trade
embargo on Cuba in the early 1960s, American cigar smokers in the
thousands have hidden verboten stogies in their luggage in the
attempt to get them past customs inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, tobacconists in London, Toronto, Mexico City and
elsewhere have pursued a profitable sideline mailing contraband
Cuban cigars to customers in the United States. Usually the bands,
labels and boxes are removed to prevent their identification by
postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Run-of-the-mill tourists usually suffer no more than
confiscation, but the penalties for those importing or selling
Cuban cigars in commercial quantities can be severe: up to 10 years
in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. Penalties in the six recent
cederal prosecutions have included fines and guilty pleas but not
jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said there was an abundance of bootleg Cuban Cohibas,
Montecristos, Romeo Y Julietas and many more questionably
nondescript Cuban _ and pseudo-Cuban _ cigars available in the city
and across the country.

fences at the Brooklyn, Mich., track.
</P>
<P>
   But company president Greg Penske said no such improvement is
needed at the company's California Speedway in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``California Speedway is state-of-the-art,'' Penske said. ``We
haven't had an incident here and we don't plan on having one.''
</P>
<P>
   Penske said the fatal accident, where a wheel on racer Adrian
Fernandez's car was sheered off in a collision with the wall, then
bounced an estimated 40 feet over a retaining wall into the crowd,
was the first involving fans in the Michigan track's 34-year
history. And Championship Auto Racing, sanctioning body of the
race, found no fault with the track or its safety precautions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an unfortunate accident,'' Penske said. ``Safety
has always been our highest concern and priority for our facilities
and it continues to be. Still, we felt we could enhance our safety
at Michigan (with a higher fence). ``We, like everyone else, just
feel for the families of those killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop that train:Jeff Gordon has won three of the past four
Winston Cup events and has a streak of six straight top-five
finishes going.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone hoping for a Gordon stumble at this week's Bud at the
Glen road race at Watkins Glen, N.Y., had better wait a week.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is the defending Bud champ and won this year's only other
road event at Sears Point in Sonoma. And at Watkins Glen, he has
his victory last year, two other top five finishes and a top 10 in
his five career starts.
</P>
<P>
   King of the rock: Mark Martin took his eighth International Race
of Champions trophy and his fourth IROC season title last Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   And because the victory came on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
it was very special.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sweetest day of my life,'' said Martin, a driver
who doesn't waste many words on hyperbole. ``I now know where
victory lane is at Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin started the 40-lap, 100-mile race in the back row, 11th
of 12 cars. He worked his way into position to challenge, moving
past Al Unser Jr. into second place on lap 28. On lap 36, he ran
past Jimmy Vasser into the lead and held on.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who won previous IROC season titles in 1994, 1996 and
1997, finished the '98 season with 86 points and $225,000 in prize
money. Jeff Burton was second with 57 points, Jeff Gordon third
with 51.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field in order of finish: Unser Jr. 46, Terry
Labonte 39, Tony Stewart 37, Dale Earnhardt 36, Vasser 34, Randy
LaJoie 31, Dale Jarrett 29, Tom Kendall 28 and Arie Luyendyk 26.
</P>
<P>
   New faces: Look for a changed field in next year's IROC starting
grid.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will certainly be back. Likely other returners will
include Gordon, Unser Jr., Earnhardt, Vasser and Jarrett _ each an
icon in his branch of motor racing.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who has been without a steady ride this season, is
likely out as the road racing representative. And the other spots
are likely to change too, though Stewart and Luyendyk could return
representing the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   With one spot annually offered to the winner of the Busch Grand
National Series, next year's IROC run could offer the interesting
matchup of current Busch points leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. racing
against his father.
</P>
<P>
   Should have listened: Early in the season, when M.K. Kanke was
building a Fort Knox-like lead in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Tour points race, the Granada Hills racer cautioned that a couple
of bad races could quickly bring his team back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   A broken wheel, a blown rear-end and two did-not-finish races
later, Kanke is bouncing off tree-tops and scraping bottom on
hedgerows as the tour moves to Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield
Saturday for the Hall Ambulance 100.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke's lead, 115 points over runner-up Steve Portenga before
the spate of bad luck, now stands at a meager 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Kanke who considers Mesa
Marin _ where he holds the track record and has won each of his
last two visits _ his home course. ``Hopefully, our bad luck will
be by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanke said his car remains strong, despite the recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running ninth at Sears point and broke the steering,''
Kanke said. ``And we were third at El Cajon and lost the rear end.
We've got a good car, we've just been unlucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Street racers: Work is under way on the 1.4-mile road course
through Exposition Park in downtown Los Angeles that will serve as
home to Los Angeles Street Race competitors Sept. 5-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Day weekend events include competition by the NASCAR
Southwest Featherlite Tour, led by Kanke, with special appearances
by Winston Cup drivers Mark Martin, Ken Schrader and Chad Little.
Other tours running races on the L.A. road course that weekend will
be the American Cities Racing League, the Porsche Pro Racing
Series, and the Ultra Wheel Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket Information: 1-800-690-RACE.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: North Hollywood's Jeff Shafer finished sixth at
last week's KOOL/Toyota Atlantic Championship stop at
Trois-Rivieres, Quebec... Tom Kendall will drive the No.46 The
Money Store Chevrolet in Bud at the Glen Winston Cup stop on
Sunday... Jimmy Spencer will start this week's Bud at the Glen but
will turn his car over to Craftsman Truck series regular Boris Said
at the first opportunity. Spencer is not fully recovered from a
concussion suffered at last weekend's Brickyard 400... Palmdale's
Lance Hooper was 17th last week in the Busch Kroger 200 at
Indianapolis. &QL;

 &HT;    A. Jones' HRs back Maddux
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As they prepared to embark on their lone West Coast
road trip of the season, the Braves had the perfect formula for a
quick getaway Thursday: Greg Maddux facing the Reds and Kid
Peroxide pounding Cincinnati again. Then again.
</P>
<P>
   With Maddux throwing a three-hitter and Andruw Jones _ he of the
newly dyed blonde hair _ belting two home runs, the Braves beat
Cincinnati 5-0 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   For Maddux, his fifth shutout was also his 15th victory, tying
him for the major-league lead. For Jones, his first-inning solo
homer was his fourth off Mike Remlinger in just 12 career at-bats.
In the eighth, he crushed a two-run homer off John Hudek for his
19th homer of the year and fourth two-homer game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That, and Andres Galarraga's 35th homer, was enough to end the
homestand 4-2 and quickly get the Braves onto their charter flight
to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Such a contrast to Wednesday's ugliness. That 13-9 loss marked
the most runs scored against the Braves since they moved into
Turner Field last year, and the most runs allowed by the Braves in
Atlanta since a 16-4 loss to Colorado Aug. 12, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox had the remedy for that: Give Maddux the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pitching brilliantly since the All-Star break, Maddux
had gone just 2-3. On this night, he was, if not untouchable,
absolutely dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first seven innings, the Reds (who hadn't beaten
Maddux since June 1, 1996) managed to hit just seven balls out of
the infield: three singles and four fly balls. Cincinnati managed
no more than one baserunner in an inning, only two advancing as far
as second. The Braves, meanwhile, quickly gave Maddux some support.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones drove Remlinger's first pitch of the second inning
over the center field wall, it was his fourth homer in his last 11
games _ and his fourth in just 12 career at-bats against the Reds
left-hander. Of Jones' 41 major-league homers, 11 have come off
Cincinnati pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta made it 2-0 in the second. After singles by Walt Weiss
and Chipper Jones, Galarraga hit a one-out grounder to second. The
Reds got the force-out at second but when shortstop Barry Larkin's
throw to first bounced away for an error, Weiss scored. In the
sixth, Galarraga made it 3-0 with a 418-foot homer, his first since
July 24.

HISTORY BIG LOSER AT TRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DEL MAR _ Bit by bit, the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association is unveiling a plan for the sport's future. But does it
have a plan for the sport's past?
</P>
<P>
   One duty of a ``league office,'' which the 100-day-old NTRA
proposes to be, is to be the keeper of the historical flame. A
league office pulls together statistics, other records and other
aspects of its stars' biographies.
</P>
<P>
   We know what the home-run record is, and which batters have a
chance to break it this year, because all the numbers, names and
dates are written down in a book bearing the seals of the National
and American leagues. Almost every sport, from baseball to bowling
to stock-car racing, has a similar record book or encyclopedia or
Who's Who.
</P>
<P>
   Not thoroughbred racing. The last edition of the annual American
Racing Manual was published by the Daily Racing Form in 1994,
containing only skeletal history. There is no definitive racing
encyclopedia. If you're a journalist or a curious fan, and you want
to know about the personalities of the past, you had better be
prepared to leaf through dozens of media guides and books. This I
discovered during a frustrating couple of days researching the
early Triple Crown winners at the California Thoroughbred Racing
Association library in Arcadia in May.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, there must be a single paragraph summing up the life
and accomplishments of Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, one of the great
trainers of all time. But I couldn't find one.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Park publicity staff has done a good thing,
surveying major tracks around the country and compiling a national
records section for its media guide. If you want to know the amount
of the highest pick-six payoff ever or the most stakes won by one
jockey in a day, finally there's somewhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   But there's much more to be done. And soon, before the
generations that remember the old days take their secrets to the
grave.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that NTRA executives say they know it.
</P>
<P>
   In Del Mar this week for a board meeting, NTRA commissioner Tim
Smith enumerated the association's many tasks, including marketing
the sport, expanding television coverage, promoting new wagers that
might compete with state lotteries, encouraging equine welfare and
sorting out the increasingly confusing medication issues. And
consolidating information and making it more available to fans than
it has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity we have, and I think it's an important one, is
to tie everything together for the fan,'' Smith said, promising
``one-stop'' information sources.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing newspapers and magazines lack the space to publish
rankings of leading horses, jockeys and trainers, as they might for
more popular sports, the NTRA is putting out that information in
its print ads. This will be especially important when or if
national racing series, producing points standings like NASCAR's or
professional tennis', come to be.
</P>
<P>
   NTRA executives say they're also exploring ways to educate
potential fans about the complexities of racetrack wagering, and to
simplify it by publishing simpler alternatives to Racing Form
past-performance charts.
</P>
<P>
   But information is more valuable in context. And how will the
NTRA impress the public that today's leading horses and horsemen
are accomplishing something historic unless it also promotes the
idea that history matters?
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Del Mar offers a pair of modest $100,000 stakes for
fillies and mares, making this the calm before Pacific Classic
week.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old fillies sprint 6{ furlongs Saturday in the
Sorrento, whose last notable winner was Phone Chatter in 1993. The
favorite is Bob Baffert-trained, Mike Pegram-owned Silverbulletday,
coming off a stakes victory at Churchill Downs and a
fastest-of-the-morning 6-furlong workout at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   The 6{-furlong Rancho Bernardo Handicap on Sunday will get a new
champion. Track Gal was retired for breeding _ and is in foal to
Deputy Minister in Kentucky _ after winning the race the past three
years. She tied the Del Mar record for a single stakes held by
Native Diver (San Diego Handicap, 1963-65) and Flawlessly (Ramona
Handicap, '92-94).
</P>
<P>
   The Rancho Bernardo favorites are familiar faces anyway: Tiffany
Diamond, trying to be the first double stakes winner of the Del Mar
season after capturing the Fantastic Girl on opening day; Corona
Lake, back at her distance and class level; and Advancing Star, a
multiple stakes winner seeking her first '98 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million Pacific Classic is Aug. 15. Probable runners:
Touch Gold, Gentlemen, Puerto Madero and Free House.
Less-than-probable runners: Mud Route and Hal's Pal.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere: Real Quiet's injury, to his right hind leg, canceled
this weekend's hoped-for rematch with Victory Gallop, the colt
whose Belmont Stakes rally prevented a Triple Crown. It could also
cost Real Quiet the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop and Coronado's Quest, the leading active
candidates, resume their campaigns in the $1 million Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth Park on the New Jersey seashore Sunday. A
small field is expected to include Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major race, the $400,000 Whitney Handicap at
Saratoga, draws the leading eastern handicap horses except
top-ranked Skip Away. Expected to run: Frisk Me Now (assigned 119
pounds), Awesome Again, (117), Precocity (116), Crypto Star (116),
Banker's Gold (115) and Tale of the Cat (112). &QL;

Investigators say the disappearance of the beloved statue from Carl

BARNICLE, GLOBE PUBLISHER TO MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a day when Mike Barnicle challenged The Boston
Globe's decision to ask for his resignation, everyone from a
``stunned'' Acting Governor Paul Cellucci to CNN talk show host
Larry King to nearly 2,000 Globe readers weighed in on the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not submitting this resignation,'' said Barnicle Thursday
while pleading his case on local and national media outlets. The
Globe said it was still insisting on it, adding that a meeting
between Barnicle and publisher Benjamin B. Taylor was scheduled for
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of readers who contacted the
Globe Thursday expressed the hope that the paper would retain the
popular 25-year Metro columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Globe editor Matthew V. Storin asked for Barnicle's resignation
Wednesday night after an Aug.2 column in which, Barnicle
acknowledged, he had used a number of jokes that appeared in
comedian George Carlin's 1997 book, ``BrainDroppings.'' Barnicle
told the Globe he had received the column material from friends and
was unaware that it had come from Carlin's book.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, on Wednesday afternoon, the Globe accepted Barnicle's
explanation and suspended him for one month without pay for using
``poor judgment.'' But the paper asked for his resignation after
seeing a WCVB-Ch. 5 clip from the station's June 22 ``Chronicle''
program that showed Barnicle holding up the book and recommending
it as ``a yuk on every page.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Barnicle had told editors he had never read the
Carlin book, Storin concluded that he ``misrepresented himself
either to his television audience or his editors,'' adding that
``this contradiction is unacceptable.'' Globe editors said that
Barnicle did not tell them about his endorsement of the book.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, publisher Taylor said ``it's
essential that we maintain the highest standards and that they be
applied evenly across the board. Credibility is our most important
asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle suggested Thursday that his endorsement of the book did
not mean he had read it. ``Clearly they have not looked at the
(Channel 5) tape,'' he said. ``BrainDroppings'' is part of a
``suggested reading list. There are about 15 books included. The
Carlin book is up there for four seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle story was at or near the top of every local
newscast Thursday, with interviews of the columnist. In addition,
the story was reported on national networks such as ABC and CNN,
and was the subject of animated discussion on a nationally
syndicated radio show and local talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe was deluged with calls and e-mail messages Thursday.
As of late last night, the Globe's city desk had received 1,569
calls and e-mail messages from readers, with only 95 of those
people saying that Barnicle should lose his job. The rest said that
Barnicle should face no more than a brief suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 463 people had contacted the ombudsman's office by
3 p.m. Thursday, and another 500 people had called other
departments of the Globe, with most in support of Barnicle. About
100 readers had canceled their subscription by noon.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came from throughout New England and from as far away
as Maryland and Colorado. A common theme among callers was that the
issue was not as serious as the fabrication of characters and
quotes that cost former Globe columnist Patricia Smith her job, and
that the Globe was overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best column in the Globe,'' said Anita Milano of
Quincy, who described herself as a Barnicle reader for many years.
``It's real. It's a part of us. I clip many of the columns and send
them to people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the outpouring of support for Mike,'' said
Storin, who is on vacation overseas. ``But professional standards
and good communication between writers and editors are absolutely
crucial to any newspaper. We made a tough and painful decision that
was necessary under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll &UR;  &LR; conducted Thursday by MSNBC, a national cable network,
elicited 1,549 responses, one of the strongest viewer reactions to
a poll the network has seen. To the question, ``Should Mike
Barnicle be forced to resign from The Boston Globe?'' 90 percent
responded that he should not, according to MSNBC spokeswoman
Cameron Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   A poll &UR;  &LR; conducted by ABC News on its website found 57 percent
supported Barnicle while 43 percent thought he should resign.
Locally, a poll conducted by WHDH-Ch. 7 last night found that 60
percent of respondents believed Barnicle should lose his job, while
40 percent said he should not.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy attracted attention from media personalities.
Radio host Don Imus contended Barnicle's transgression is ``not a
fire-able offense.'' Barnicle is a frequent guest on ``Imus in the
Morning,'' a nationally syndicated radio show that is televised on
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Larry King called the radio program and argued that
``firing him is insane. They're giving up one of the best
columnists, who will have a hundred offers tomorrow'' from other
newspapers. ``He's too good a columnist and this is too weak a
case,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   King took issue, though, with Barnicle's recommendation of a
book he had not read. While acknowledging that he himself sometimes
does not read the books of authors he is interviewing, King said he
makes that clear on his TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cellucci weighed in, saying, ``I am just stunned by how
quickly that story has developed. I am going to watch and see what
happens. But certainly I have been a fan, read his column all the
time, you know. It's a stunning development.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Barnicle's other employers were also evaluating his
status Thursday in light of the Globe controversy. Channel 5 issued
a statement saying, ``Mike Barnicle has been an important
contributor to WCVB for the past 15 years. We have always had
confidence in his work and continue to have confidence in his work
at this television station. He admits making a mistake by
recommending a book on `Chronicle' he did not read and we accept
his explanation and expression of regret. He remains a contributor
to WCVB-TV.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, which has Barnicle under contract as an on-air
commentator, said, ``His commentary has no relationship to the
content of his Boston Globe columns. Currently, he remains a valued
contributor for MSNBC. We will continue to assess the situation as
it develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle also receives a small honorarium as regular regional
commentator on PBS's ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' Thursday, the
program's communications director, Bruce Lott, said Barnicle would
not appear on the the ``NewsHour'' until his situation with the
Globe is resolved. ``As of right now, no decision has been made on
whether we'll continue to use Mr. Barnicle,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, journalistic analysts were assessing the
Globe's decision on Barnicle and offering a mixed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, either to the editors or the viewers of that
show, he was dissembling,'' said Bill Kovach, the curator of
Harvard's Nieman Foundation. ``I don't think (the Globe) had a
choice. I think Mike has gotten caught'' at a time of changing
journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Colon, an ethics instructor at the Poynter Institute for
Media Studies in St. Petersburg, likened Barnicle's assertion that
he recommended a book he hadn't read to CNN reporter Peter Arnett's
plea that he had narrated the network's ill-fated nerve gas report
without really being aware of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's using the kind of Peter Arnett excuse,'' said Colon.
``At least at this point it seems like the Globe took the right
step asking for his resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   One dissenter is Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Shorenstein
Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``My belief is
Barnicle ought to be cut some slack.'' said Kalb. ``He did
something hurried and foolish, but he did not do something evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for Barnicle's resignation follows the June
departure of black Metro columnist Smith, who admitted fabricating
characters in quotes in some columns. After Smith's resignation,
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz accused the Globe of acting
inconsistently for not similarly disciplining Barnicle for a 1990
column that Dershowitz said contained a fabricated quote attributed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, both the New York Times and Steven Brill's ``Content''
magazine reported that the Globe paid Dershowitz a $75,000
settlement in that case. Neither the Globe nor Dershowitz would
confirm that report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Burnham, a civil rights attorney who wrote a Boston
magazine article accusing the Globe of a racially tinged double
standard for treating Smith's transgressions more harshly than
Barnicle, said Thursday, ``I think the Globe had no choice but to
ask for his resignation. If anyone's to be faulted here, it is the
Globe for not taking seriously the complaints about Barnicle long
ago.''

TOMMY SHOULD WAKE UP AND SMELL THE LINGUINI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Does my old pal Tommy Lasorda know
something I don't know?
</P>
<P>
   While he's done everything during his brief time as general
manager of the Dodgers to improve the station of his team short of
offering Rupert Murdoch legal advice on his divorce proceedings or
volunteering to join John Glenn on his space flight, he blindly has
ignored a most harrowing reality.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Dodgers somehow are able to leapfrog past the
Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets in the
wild-card derby -- and you need an imagination as zany as Lasorda's
to envision this happening -- then the team would face the Braves'
execution squad from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And then, if by small quirk of wacky fate, these erratic Dodgers
somehow had an out-of-body experience against the Braves, they
would have to endure the gauntlet against either the San Diego
Padres or Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Ol' Tommy, luvvie (cq)
</P>
<P>
   dear, please, wake up before it's too late, smell the orchids,
enjoy the perks of your new calling, watch those calories, get your
sleep, invite Fred Claire up to your Dodger Stadium box for a
linguini clambake, and stop becoming so enraged with those
numbskulls in the fourth estate who haven't skinned their knees
leaping aboard your hysterical bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   I beg you, Tommy, cool it with your fanatical attempt to inject
some superficial excitement into a Dodger season before this
agonizing team of yours actually rises up out of its season-long
stupor and realizes your fanciful dream.
</P>
<P>
   We suffer enough sporting humiliation here in Southern
California -- no NFL franchise, no NHL franchises worth mentioning,
too many Donald Sterlings, too few championships -- without another
0-3 Dodger playoff impalement staring ominously at us on the faint
horizon. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Actually, there are benefits to Tommy Lasorda stripping the
Dodgers of their best minor-league prospects to bring in a bunch of
guys whose surnames I can't pronounce. Hey, he has kept the Dodgers
ahead of both the Milwaukee Brewers and Philadephia Phillies in
that hair-raising wild-card chase that for some strange reason has
left me in a perpetual state of indifference. ...
</P>
<P>
   --OK, I'm not hooked on phonics, but you try pronouncing Mark
Grudzielanek's name without suffering an asthmatic attack. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Brace yourself because I'm going to make the boldest statement
I've ever made in this newspaper -- the Angels won't make it to the
playoffs with their current feeble pitching staff. Now if I know
that, why didn't Tony Tavares and Bill Bavasi know it at the
trading deadline? ...
</P>
<P>
   --I'm not surprised by Mark McGwire's 4-for-43 slump. He's
always been a prolific home-run hitter during his career but never
has hit for much of an average. ...
</P>
<P>
   --When I shook hands with UCLA coach Bob Toledo the other day at
the Pac-10 media session, he asked me, ``Are you a tennis player?''
I laughed, and told him no, that I'm a yachtsman. ...
</P>
<P>
   --I keep hearing that Shaquille O'Neal is working out
passionately and is determined to be in the best shape of his life
for the upcoming season that will take place despite the current
NBA lockout. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The Jewelry Doctor, Jack Lipeles, is re-doing the 1996 Chicago
Bulls' championship ring of Ron Harper, enhancing its value with
several additional carats of diamonds. ``It's now worth several
thousands of dollars more than the fifteen hundred dollars it was
when Ron brought it to me,'' says Lipeles, the Pine Avenue jeweler
to boxing and rap stars. ...
</P>
<P>
   --As I walked around the American Boating Jubilee the other day
at the Shoreline Village Marina, I was astounded by the incredible
revival that has taken place in an area that was a doormat only a
short time ago. ``Long live praying mantises and all their
brothers, sisters, moms, dads, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews,''
cracked Parker's Lighthouse resident wit Jolly John Grady,
referring to the impact that the recently opened Aquarium of the
Pacific has had in the teeming vicinity. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Paul Hackett sounds like a football coach, acts like a
football coach, talks like a football coach, even walks like a
football coach. Now all we have to find out is if the guy can
actually coach like a football coach. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The Mother Teresa of my Long Beach neighborhood, Esther
Fawcett, recently retired after serving 40 years as a volunteer
aide at Memorial Hospital. I'm not sure I'd be typing these words
out had Esther not been around during those dangerous bachelor
years when I too often needed to be saved from myself. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Forum matchmaker Tony Curtis, not to be confused with
Hollywood actor Tony Curtis, who's younger, tells me that Monday
night's NABO bantamweight title fight between Mauricio Martinez and
Marcos Badillo at the Pond should not be viewed by spectators with
faint hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a bloody, all-out war,'' says Curtis. ``If you
don't like violence, then you better not watch it.'' Will it be as
violent as Bill Clinton vs. Monica Lewinsky? ...
</P>
<P>
   --I can't believe it. A whole week has passed, and I haven't
read one story speculating on Michael Jordan's future. ...
</P>
<P>
   --I don't feel sorry for Cecil Fielder. If the guy would have
kept himself in proper shape over the years, he'd still be an
effective batsman. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Long Beach celebrity restaurateur Phil Trani to projected
Stanford starting quarterback Todd Husak, former St. John Bosco
star and son of Loyola Marymount athletic director Bill Husak:
``You gotta meet Cade McNown.'' That would be great, cooed young
Husak, a big fan of UCLA's Heisman Trophy candidate. Trani has
become McNown's surrogate father. ...
</P>
<P>
   --It'll be interesting to see how Mike Piazza performs next
season when his contract hassles are behind him. If he hits below
his usual standards again, then it will become indisputable that
the Dodgers were the perfect fit for him and that he made a
terrible career move disrupting it. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The death this week of the one-time colorful NBA referee
Richie Powers brought back some fond memories for me. I used to tip
a few with Powers after Laker games at the old King's X in
Inglewood a long time ago. Richie was an artful raconteur and
terrific official oblivious to the taunts of unfriendly crowds. ...
</P>
<P>
   --A day seldom passes in my life when I don't think of my late
friend and colleague, Allan Malamud. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Our city is booming, and yet the Pine Avenue visionary who
played a vital role in this phenomenon, John Morris, is now waging
a bitter war with those nasty bureaucrats from the Alcohol Beverage
Control, whose disdain for Long Beach is exceeded only by their
disdain for resourceful capitalistic entrepreneurs like Morris who
are thriving. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Are the Goodwill Games set for later this month, or will they
be staged in September? ...
</P>
<P>
   --OK, Les Robbins, maybe I overreacted a while back when I said
Long Beach politicians had a God-given knack for making the wrong
choice on every issue. Maybe it's just every other issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   They must be doing some things rights in light of the prosperity
that has visited our celestial paradise. But I still think the
rascals blew it when they decided not even to look into the
viability of building a football stadium here that would have
inevitably resulted in Long Beach luring an NFL team. What would
that have done for the city? ...
</P>
<P>
   --A publicity firm called the office the other day with the
startling announcement that swimming great Susie Atwood, who
performed in both the 1968 and 1972 Olympics, was going to make a
comeback Sunday in Portland in the Nike Masters competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nice local yarn, except it was news to the principal herself,
Susie Atwood, who, instead, plans to spend the day with her hubbie
to be, former Secret Service gumshoe Dave Butler, sprucing up their
new Peninsula digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have greater priorities in my life now than to swim the
backstroke 12 miles a day,'' says Susie, now a State Farm agent and
local social arbiter.

INTEREST IN THE BABE IS A HOME RUN

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- At a time when the attention span of the
average American is measured in seconds and history is considered
non-essential, Babe Ruth, deceased for 50 years, still packs a
wallop.
</P>
<P>
   With the baseball community very homer happy at the moment, the
image of Ruth and Roger Maris are almost tangible alongside Mark
McGwire, Ken Griffey and other sluggers challenging their domain.
In Ruth's case, he will at least be visible.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and Black Canyon Productions, which have collaborated on
most of the top sports documentaries in the '90s, will pay homage
to Ruth with a one-hour documentary special debuting Aug. 16, the
50th anniversary of Ruth's death.
</P>
<P>
   HBO is also premiering the documentary in various cities prior
to its Aug. 16 release, including Long Beach at 7 p.m. Wednesday at
the Carpenter Performing Arts Center on the Long Beach State
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only premiere and reception, hosted by HBO,
Charter Communications and the Press-Telegram, will be attended by
a dozen former ballplayers from the area. Hall of Famer Bob Lemon
will attend, along with former area prep stars such as Rod Gaspar,
Bruce Ellingsen and Buck Taylor, ex-Dodgers Tommy Davis and Norm
Larker, and local coaching legend John Herbold.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruth documentary was a challenge for the cable movie network
and production company. Many of their past efforts have looked at
issues and stories which had gone untouched for years. This time,
they had to find a way to look at Ruth's life that offered more
than his statistical achievements and well-known anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Black Canyon found some never-before-seen color home movies of
Ruth that they use in the last half of the documentary and decided
to focus on two areas of his life -- his sad last days in baseball,
and why he still resonates today, 50 years after his passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a documentary that explains why he still
has such a vibrant impact on the game of baseball,'' said HBO
senior producer Rick Bernstein. ``This is less of a linear look at
his career as much as a character-driven documentary. We wanted to
show people why Ruth was bigger-than-life and the last years of his
career, which a lot of people may not know much about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth never realized his dream of managing the Yankees, or any
team for that matter. He thought he was going to become a
player-manager with the Boston Braves, but it turned out he was
little more than a ticket attraction. He was very ill the last few
years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruth was a simple man who enjoyed life to its fullest,'' said
Bernstein. ``I think it's interesting that he earned a reputation
as a hard-drinking, hard-loving man, yet he always seemed happiest
when he was around kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's adopted daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, is one of 31
different people who were interviewed for the documentary.
Bernstein admits he was concerned how she would feel about the
segment on Ruth's drinking and carousing. ``That was a part of his
life, and we were not going to exclude it or sugar-coat it,'' he
said. ``But I hated the idea of making an 81-year-old woman
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't. Ms. Stevens was a guest at the New York screening
last month and called it the best work she's ever seen on her
father.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and Charter are donating $1 for every new HBO subscription
this month to the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association
as part of the premiere showing Wednesday. More former players are
expected to be added to the list of invitees between today and the
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred tickets to the premiere also are being offered to
the public via a contest in today's Press-Telegram. The first 50
people to correctly answer 10 questions about Ruth and fax them to
the P-T will each get two tickets to the premiere. The ad is on
Page B5 in today's sports section.
</P>
<P>
   BOB STARR: In 1993, former Angels' and Rams' radio announcer Bob
Starr contracted the rare and often deadly Legionnaires' disease
while traveling. He spent 10 days in the hospital and would recover
well enough to continue his broadcast career.
</P>
<P>
   But he never totally recovered from that episode and often
suffered respiratory problems. Late last season, he had to begin
carrying oxygen with him at all times at Angels' games. He became
bed-ridden in December and passed away Monday at his home in
Orange. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Starr called Angels' games from 1980 to 1989 and again from 1993
to 1997, and Rams' games from 1980 to 1989 and again in 1993. His
career in broadcasting included stops with the Boston Red Sox and
both the baseball and football St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   His best work in Los Angeles was the crisp, assured work he did
as the play-by-play voice of the Rams. He was smooth and had a
voice which transmitted the excitement on the field to his radio
audience.
</P>
<P>
   GAME ON: The latest skirmish in the on-going war between Disney
(ABC/ESPN) and Fox moved to the ice this week. Published reports
say Disney has offered a $600-million deal to the NHL for exclusive
over-the-air and cable rights for five years, beginning in the
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   That $125 million-a-year offer represents a nearly three-fold
increase in the NHL's annual take. Fox (over-the-air) and ESPN
(cable) currently pay the NHL $46 million a year. Fox has one year
left on a five-year, $155-million deal, and ESPN one year on a
seven-year, $100-million cable deal.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL plans to snap that loose change up quicker than one can
say Pavel Bure. The league's TV ratings have actually declined the
last year despite Fox's commitment to a game of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the over-the-air package is an add-on. Disney's
quest is to lock up the cable package and keep it away from Fox,
which would love to add a national NHL contract for its
ever-growing regional cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has until next Friday to counter the ABC offer, and it's
unlikely they will.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: Fox Sports West 2 will air four Charger
preseason games, beginning Saturday with their game against the
49ers (7 p.m.). ... Fox (11) will air the finals of the Toshiba
Tennis Classic Sunday at 12:30 p.m., its first-ever tennis
coverage. ... ESPN Classic Sports will feature Martina Navratilova
in a special and replay of her 1984 U.S. Open win against Chris
Evert on Sunday. The network will also air Bud Collins' top 10 U.S.
Open matches, beginning Sunday with John McEnroe-Jimmy Connors in
the 1984 Open.
</P>
<P>
   THE TV SPORTS WORLD ACCORDING TO ME: The women's sports market
obviously is still in its infancy. How else can one explain why
three figure skaters topped the list of the most marketable female
athletes in Street &AMP; Smith's Sports Business Journal, and why
soccer star Mia Hamm topped a similar survey by The Sports Business
Daily (SBD). Hamm did not make the S&AMP;S top 10, and the skaters
placed second (Michelle Kwan), fourth (Tara Lipinski) and 17th
(Kristi Yamaguchi) in the SBD list. ... The spinmeisters at ESPN
commissioned a study by A.C. Nielsen to illustrate how many viewers
watch the cable network in bars, hotels, restaurants and even at
work places. The results bump ESPN's typical audience numbers for,
say,
</P>
<P>
   SportsCenter by nine percent, and say that a third of all
out-of-home viewers watch ESPN. No one denies ESPN's appeal, but
chasing down a number for sports bar attendance -- what else would
they watch? -- is a weak response to Nielsen's usual numbers which
indicate ESPN's numbers are down and Fox Sports News numbers are
up. ... Must-read: Rich Marotta, the KFI sports voice and TV boxing
commentary, has an awesome website at www.kfi640.com. The most
recent edition featured Marotta's take on Mike Tyson, flyweight
Mark Johnson, Don Dunphy and other topical boxing items, plus his
list of the top pound-for-pound fighters. ... The Goodwill Games
posted a 1.6 rating on Turner, proving that some people will watch
anything.

MICROSOFT TOOTS ITS OWN HORN  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - MICROSOFT   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A key foundation of Microsoft Corp.'s defense in the pending
antitrust case against it may have some cracks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that Microsoft used its
market-leading Windows software to promote its Internet Explorer
Web browser _ giving it an unfair edge over a rival browser from
Netscape Communications. Microsoft's browser has vaulted from a 20
percent market share in January 1997 to more than 40 percent
currently. But the company insists that Explorer succeeded on its
own merits.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates has maintained
_ both in a U.S. Senate hearing in March and a recent Economist
article _ that Internet Explorer ``has won 19 out of 20
head-to-head reviews against Netscape's, which is why we have seen
more and more consumers using it.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument is part of a multipronged legal strategy. The
software giant also asserts that its Internet plans were well under
way before Netscape was founded, and that a federal appeals court
in June ruled that Microsoft has the right to include separate
products such as IE 4.0 in the Windows operating system. In
addition, Microsoft vehemently denies Justice Department charges
that it bullied Internet service providers and computer-makers into
distributing its browser exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is set for September 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's claims of technical superiority are debatable,
contend critics who say Microsoft is stacking the deck. An
evaluation of the ``20 head-to-head reviews'' _ which appeared in
both computer magazines and mainstream newspapers _ cited by
Microsoft reveals less-than-ringing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   _``Based on features alone _ and I don't think I enjoy saying
this _ Internet Explorer is the prettier twin, warts and all,'' PC
World said in a December 1997 review.
</P>
<P>
   _``You may be better off waiting several months for Microsoft to
flush out the problems or waiting until Windows 98 or Windows NT
5.0 appear formally,'' Computerworld opined in a December 15, 1997,
review.
</P>
<P>
   _``Although we recommend using (IE 4.0) as your preferred Web
client, the smart surfer will keep both products around,'' said
Windows Magazine in a December 1997 piece.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes an October 14, 1997, Chronicle story with
the headline, ``Explorer 4.0: 10 ways to love it, hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counts all those conclusions among its wins.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the 20 reviews reveals that Microsoft fared
favorably in 14 stories _ not 19 as it claimed _ and that half of
those ``wins'' did not include direct comparisons with Netscape's
Communicator browser. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did score outright ``head-to-head'' victories in
comparison to Netscape in the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles
Times, Boston Globe, Houston Chronicle and several other
publications. Netscape officials said they're disturbed by
Microsoft's aggressive marketing tactics _ including the firm's
apparent exaggeration of review conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our continuing frustrations has been that the press and
public have a tendency to take at face value whatever Microsoft
says, even when Microsoft is plainly wrong,'' Netscape general
counsel Roberta Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the less-than-convincing reviews could
undercut Microsoft's credibility in court but probably won't hurt
its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises doubts about their honesty by inflating the accepted
conclusion that IE 4.0 is a better product,'' said analyst Rob
Enderle, of Giga Information in Santa Clara. ``They did themselves
damage when they didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials are backpedaling from earlier boasts,
acknowledging that the reviews don't amount to an overwhelming
victory. However, officials said the reviews prove that the company
has significantly improved Explorer, which has translated into
improved market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we made a better product, we were getting killed in
reviews,'' Microsoft spokesman Jim Cohen said. ``Now that we are
innovating, we are winning consumers and gaining a competitive
advantage. How can that hurt the market?''
</P>
<P>
   The company also noted that most computer magazine reviews are
analytical and do not lend themselves to screaming endorsements,
the way some movie reviews do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviews are tough to gauge,'' said Rob Bennett, Internet
Explorer group product manager. ``There are good and bad points to
every product. It is hard to define something as a 100 percent win.
But if a review in the end says we have a good product, we'll take
that as a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen downplayed the importance of Gates' previous claims that
the reviews prove that Explorer 4 is a superior product. He said
the browser comparison represents a ``minimal factor'' in the
antitrust case, even though it is prominently mentioned as a major
strategy on a company Web site ( &LR; www.microsoft.com/presspass &LR; 
 &LR; /doj/7-28formalresponse.htm &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft first broached the idea of incorporating
``Internet connectivity as an integral part of the Windows
operating system'' in December 1993 _ before Netscape was founded.
</P>
<P>
   At a computer show in April 1994, Gates publicly discussed
building Net access directly into its next version of Windows,
Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is convinced Microsoft tried to kill off
Netscape,'' Cohen said. ``But what's important is that a federal
appeals court in June decided that Microsoft has the right to
integrate IE 4.0 into Windows OS.''

BARNICLE, GLOBE PUBLISHER TO MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a day when Mike Barnicle challenged The Boston
Globe's decision to ask for his resignation, everyone from a
``stunned'' Acting Governor Paul Cellucci to CNN talk show host
Larry King to nearly 2,000 Globe readers weighed in on the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not submitting this resignation,'' said Barnicle Thursday
while pleading his case on local and national media outlets. The
Globe said it was still insisting on it, adding that a meeting
between Barnicle and publisher Benjamin B. Taylor was scheduled for
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of readers who contacted the
Globe Thursday expressed the hope that the paper would retain the
popular 25-year Metro columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Globe editor Matthew V. Storin asked for Barnicle's resignation
Wednesday night after an Aug.2 column in which, Barnicle
acknowledged, he had used a number of jokes that appeared in
comedian George Carlin's 1997 book, ``BrainDroppings.'' Barnicle
told the Globe he had received the column material from friends and
was unaware that it had come from Carlin's book.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, on Wednesday afternoon, the Globe accepted Barnicle's
explanation and suspended him for one month without pay for using
``poor judgment.'' But the paper asked for his resignation after
seeing a WCVB-Ch. 5 clip from the station's June 22 ``Chronicle''
program that showed Barnicle holding up the book and recommending
it as ``a yuk on every page.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Barnicle had told editors he had never read the
Carlin book, Storin concluded that he ``misrepresented himself
either to his television audience or his editors,'' adding that
``this contradiction is unacceptable.'' Globe editors said that
Barnicle did not tell them about his endorsement of the book.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, publisher Taylor said ``it's
essential that we maintain the highest standards and that they be
applied evenly across the board. Credibility is our most important
asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle suggested Thursday that his endorsement of the book did
not mean he had read it. ``Clearly they have not looked at the
(Channel 5) tape,'' he said. ``BrainDroppings'' is part of a
``suggested reading list. There are about 15 books included. The
Carlin book is up there for four seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle story was at or near the top of every local
newscast Thursday, with interviews of the columnist. In addition,
the story was reported on national networks such as ABC and CNN,
and was the subject of animated discussion on a nationally
syndicated radio show and local talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe was deluged with calls and e-mail messages Thursday.
As of late last night, the Globe's city desk had received 1,569
calls and e-mail messages from readers, with only 95 of those
people saying that Barnicle should lose his job. The rest said that
Barnicle should face no more than a brief suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 463 people had contacted the ombudsman's office by
3 p.m. Thursday, and another 500 people had called other
departments of the Globe, with most in support of Barnicle. About
100 readers had canceled their subscription by noon.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came from throughout New England and from as far away
as Maryland and Colorado. A common theme among callers was that the
issue was not as serious as the fabrication of characters and
quotes that cost former Globe columnist Patricia Smith her job, and
that the Globe was overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best column in the Globe,'' said Anita Milano of
Quincy, who described herself as a Barnicle reader for many years.
``It's real. It's a part of us. I clip many of the columns and send
them to people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the outpouring of support for Mike,'' said
Storin, who is on vacation overseas. ``But professional standards
and good communication between writers and editors are absolutely
crucial to any newspaper. We made a tough and painful decision that
was necessary under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll &UR;  &LR; conducted Thursday by MSNBC, a national cable network,
elicited 1,549 responses, one of the strongest viewer reactions to
a poll the network has seen. To the question, ``Should Mike
Barnicle be forced to resign from The Boston Globe?'' 90 percent
responded that he should not, according to MSNBC spokeswoman
Cameron Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   A poll &UR;  &LR; conducted by ABC News on its website found 57 percent
supported Barnicle while 43 percent thought he should resign.
Locally, a poll conducted by WHDH-Ch. 7 last night found that 60
percent of respondents believed Barnicle should lose his job, while
40 percent said he should not.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy attracted attention from media personalities.
Radio host Don Imus contended Barnicle's transgression is ``not a
fire-able offense.'' Barnicle is a frequent guest on ``Imus in the
Morning,'' a nationally syndicated radio show that is televised on
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Larry King called the radio program and argued that
``firing him is insane. They're giving up one of the best
columnists, who will have a hundred offers tomorrow'' from other
newspapers. ``He's too good a columnist and this is too weak a
case,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   King took issue, though, with Barnicle's recommendation of a
book he had not read. While acknowledging that he himself sometimes
does not read the books of authors he is interviewing, King said he
makes that clear on his TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cellucci weighed in, saying, ``I am just stunned by how
quickly that story has developed. I am going to watch and see what
happens. But certainly I have been a fan, read his column all the
time, you know. It's a stunning development.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Barnicle's other employers were also evaluating his
status Thursday in light of the Globe controversy. Channel 5 issued
a statement saying, ``Mike Barnicle has been an important
contributor to WCVB for the past 15 years. We have always had
confidence in his work and continue to have confidence in his work
at this television station. He admits making a mistake by
recommending a book on `Chronicle' he did not read and we accept
his explanation and expression of regret. He remains a contributor
to WCVB-TV.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, which has Barnicle under contract as an on-air
commentator, said, ``His commentary has no relationship to the
content of his Boston Globe columns. Currently, he remains a valued
contributor for MSNBC. We will continue to assess the situation as
it develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle also receives a small honorarium as regular regional
commentator on PBS's ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' Thursday, the
program's communications director, Bruce Lott, said Barnicle would
not appear on the the ``NewsHour'' until his situation with the
Globe is resolved. ``As of right now, no decision has been made on
whether we'll continue to use Mr. Barnicle,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, journalistic analysts were assessing the
Globe's decision on Barnicle and offering a mixed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, either to the editors or the viewers of that
show, he was dissembling,'' said Bill Kovach, the curator of
Harvard's Nieman Foundation. ``I don't think (the Globe) had a
choice. I think Mike has gotten caught'' at a time of changing
journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Colon, an ethics instructor at the Poynter Institute for
Media Studies in St. Petersburg, likened Barnicle's assertion that
he recommended a book he hadn't read to CNN reporter Peter Arnett's
plea that he had narrated the network's ill-fated nerve gas report
without really being aware of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's using the kind of Peter Arnett excuse,'' said Colon.
``At least at this point it seems like the Globe took the right
step asking for his resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   One dissenter is Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Shorenstein
Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``My belief is
Barnicle ought to be cut some slack.'' said Kalb. ``He did
something hurried and foolish, but he did not do something evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for Barnicle's resignation follows the June
departure of black Metro columnist Smith, who admitted fabricating
characters in quotes in some columns. After Smith's resignation,
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz accused the Globe of acting
inconsistently for not similarly disciplining Barnicle for a 1990
column that Dershowitz said contained a fabricated quote attributed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, both the New York Times and Steven Brill's ``Content''
magazine reported that the Globe paid Dershowitz a $75,000
settlement in that case. Neither the Globe nor Dershowitz would
confirm that report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Burnham, a civil rights attorney who wrote a Boston
magazine article accusing the Globe of a racially tinged double
standard for treating Smith's transgressions more harshly than
Barnicle, said Thursday, ``I think the Globe had no choice but to
ask for his resignation. If anyone's to be faulted here, it is the
Globe for not taking seriously the complaints about Barnicle long
ago.''

 THIS INTERNET OFFERING WOULD BE IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Although it appeared dead in the water, the much-anticipated
initial offering of CBS MarketWatch is back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The financial news Web site could file to go public as early as
mid-August, according to sources familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the sky-high valuations placed on other
Internet-related offerings this summer, such as Broadcast.com and
Inktomi, institutional investors began to wonder what was keeping
CBS MarketWatch from taking advantage of overly ripe market
conditions for Net IPOs. CBS MarketWatch chief executive Larry
Kramer would not comment on the company's financing plans.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, part of the delay is being blamed on legal and
accounting complications stemming from the company's status as a
50/50 joint-venture.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  CBS MarketWatch was formed in October 1997 by its two
parents: Data Broadcast Corp. of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and CBS, a
unit of New York-based Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The co-lead investment bankers on the proposed deal, BT Alex.
Brown and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, had advised the company to
seek ``outside evaluations on the (financial) contributions of the
two (parent) companies'' to avoid any pitfalls with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  Another deal-structuring snag was the fact that CBS
MarketWatch is a limited-liability corporation, or LLC _ a status
that carries federal tax implications similar to a limited
partnership. To change that, the financial news company will
convert to a standard public corporation at the time of an
offering.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch, which has 55 employees in Los Angeles,
Washington, D.C., New York and San Francisco, provides financial
news and stock quotes to individual investors. According to the
company, the number of visitors to its Web site has more than

   Taiwan's economy isn't that bad. It isn't nearly as debilitated
as those of Japan, Indonesia, Singapore et. al. That's according to
author and international investor Steve Champion, chief investment
officer of Aetna International in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout Asia there is carnage, but Taiwan has sailed
through relatively unscathed,'' says Champion, a former chief
international investment officer at Bank of America in San
Francisco and former vice chairman of the Bank of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Taiwan is immune from the Asian bug, only
that its current symptoms aren't as severe as neighboring nations,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of spreading their economic good cheer, bureaucrats
from Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs are slated to meet with
Silicon Valley business leaders today. Their pitch: build high-tech
plants in Taiwan because the island nation is more financially
stable than the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the officials are expected to court Bay Area companies
by extolling the benefits of raising capital on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got a good story to tell,'' says Champion, who
is author of ``The Great Taiwan Bubble: The Rise and Fall of An
Emerging Stock Market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've managed the economy pretty well and kept the
integrity of their banking system intact,'' says Champion, who
among his other jobs was also president of International Investment
Trust, the first fund management company in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Champion says the average price-earnings ratio of Taiwan's stock
market is now in the low 20s, which is much improved over its
100-plus ratios earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its stock market volatility is just nothing compared to what
it used to be. It used to be the wildest of the bunch,'' Champion
says.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, cronyism has been reduced, markets have been
liberalized and government financial regulations have been enacted
that actually have teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's technocratic government is run by competent
people,'' Champion says. ``One-party (political) rule has its
advantages, I guess.''

SAFEWAY BUYS BIGGEST ALASKA RETAILER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SAFEWAY   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Safeway Inc. bit off another chunk of the supermarket sector
yesterday when it announced the acquisition of Carr-Gottstein Foods
Co., Alaska's largest retailer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pleasanton-based grocery chain will pay $110 million in
cash, or $12.50 per share, for all outstanding Carr-Gottstein
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway will also assume $220 million in debt, an amount that
the supermarket giant can digest easily, but which was a heavy load
for the Alaska company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Carr-Gottstein closed yesterday at $7.88, unchanged
for the day. The retailer's stock is up 60 percent for the year but
still considerably lower than the company's 1993 initial public
offering price of $14.50. Meanwhile Safeway stock closed yesterday
at $43.31, up 6 cents for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Carr-Gottstein suffered a net loss last year of $5.6 million on
revenues of $589 million, due in part to a one-time charge for
shuttered operations. By comparison, Safeway generated a profit of
$557.4 million on sales of $22.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities for cost reduction and profit improvements
this presents to us is significant,'' said Safeway chief financial
officer Melissa Plaisance. ``We expect it to be additive to
earnings in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is scheduled to become final in early 1999 pending the
approval of federal regulators. In a conference call with reporters
yesterday, executives with both companies declined to speculate on
whether any stores might be closed due to antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The planned acquisition will give Safeway access to
Carr-Gottstein's extensive distribution network, including a fleet
of trucks, a distribution center in Tacoma, Wash. and the only food
distribution warehouse in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The system allows Carr-Gottstein to ship merchandise to Alaska
six days per week, whereas Safeway brings goods in twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Carr-Gottstein's retail operations include 15 food, drug and
general merchandise stores called Carrs Quality Centers, 12 smaller
stores which operate under different names, 16 Oaken Keg Spirit
Shops liquor stores and five tobacco stores called The Great Alaska
Tobacco Company.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway operates 16 supermarkets in Alaska. Other competitors
include Fred Meyer, Costco, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway intends to cut costs by combining buying and
administrative functions, refinancing Carr-Gottstein's debt and
adding a private-label program similar to Safeway's Select line.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes just three days after Boise-based Albertson's
Inc. announced its impending purchase of American Stores Corp.,
parent of Lucky Stores, for $11.7 billion in cash and debt.
</P>
<P>
   Plaisance said her company continues to actively seek additional
companies to purchase.

MICROSOFT STARTS BUILDING ITS VALLEY HOME  
 BY BENNY EVANGELISTA 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BALLMER   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. President Steve Ballmer broke ground yesterday
on the site of his company's new Silicon Valley campus in Mountain
View, a virtual stone's throw from rival Netscape Communications
Corp.'s headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But the ebullient Ballmer chuckled at the suggestion that the
software giant's new five-building office complex was akin to a big
bully moving into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a company that has far more partners down here in the
valley than we do competitors,'' the new Microsoft president said.
``There are thousands of companies who we benefit from and who will
benefit from a closer relationship with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, of course, our competitors,'' he added. ``And
whether you are at Oracle or Netscape or Sun, we look forward to
supporting you even better from our facility here in the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is headquartered in Redmond, Wash., will build
a 515,000-square-foot, 32-acre complex that will house nearly 800
employees now scattered in several offices from Cupertino to San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contingent is from WebTV, a Palo Alto firm acquired
by Microsoft last April. The 525 WebTV workers now work in six
different offices.
</P>
<P>
   The new facility, which will be dubbed Microsoft South Campus,
will also house about 170 workers who develop and test PowerPoint
presentation software for PCs and Apple Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   The campus also will be home to the sales and marketing staff
from Hotmail, a free e-mail service now based in Cupertino.
Microsoft bought the firm in December.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agreed to a deal with property owner Berg &AMP; Berg
Development of Cupertino to lease the land, a former Kaiser Sand &AMP;
Gravel facility at L'Avenida near Shoreline Drive. Microsoft will
construct the buildings, and the first is scheduled to open by July
1999, said Barney Kinzer, Microsoft's real estate program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not announced, but Berg &AMP; Berg President
Carl Berg said Microsoft has an initial seven-year lease with
various options that could extend the deal another 20 years. Berg
estimated Microsoft's plans could cost between $200 to $300 per
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Netscape was not quite loading the welcome wagon for its
new neighbor. A spokesperson for Netscape said, ``Our hope is
they'll be a good neighbor but we don't plan on having a block
party anytime soon.''

GOP COMPTROLLER CANDIDATE QUITS DUE TO FINANCIAL ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Mo.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Republican nominee for Connecticut's state
comptroller, part of the ethnically diverse hand-picked slate of
candidates touted by Gov. John Rowland, withdrew his candidacy
Thursday amid concerns about his involvement in a bank fraud case
in Puerto Rico, a partially falsified resume, and his lateness in
paying federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Antonio Serbia, 58, was acquitted in 1986 of charges he
participated in a bank fraud scheme in Puerto Rico. He also listed
two education degrees on his resume that he did not receive, and
has often not paid his federal income taxes on time, according to
officials at the schools and the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, which came to light in an article published
Thursday in The Hartford Courant, was a surprise to Rowland and
other Republicans, who suffered the first bump in a campaign where
they have mainly watched the governor's Democratic challenger, Rep.
Barbara Kennelly, struggle raising money and generating excitement
about her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rowland was apparently so comfortable with the race that
he was on Block Island, R.I., this week, enjoying his second
vacation of the summer, when the news broke.
</P>
<P>
   During the federal trial, Serbia was accused of helping prepare
false loans at a bank in Puerto Rico and in some cases using the
money for his own purposes, according to a 1986 article in the San
Juan Star. During the trial, he defended himself by saying he had
signed blank notes for the bank's president because he trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday evening, Serbia said he would
withdraw because he realized continuing questions about his trial
would hurt the rest of the Republican ticket. ``This election
should be about the future of the state of Connecticut, not about
my past,'' Serbia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was acquitted _ found to be innocent after a full
trial _ I looked on that episode of my life as over,'' Serbia
added. ``Unfortunately, in the world of politics, that is not how
it works.''
</P>
<P>
   State party chairman Christopher DePino, who spent the day
talking with Serbia, said he felt the withdrawal was best for the
Republican Party, a sentiment also expressed by Rowland in a brief
written statement. ``The Democrat Party doesn't have any issues to
run against John Rowland on,'' DePino said. ``And I did not want
his personal situation to be their issue for 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, Rowland campaign spokesman, said that Serbia did
not mention the Puerto Rico bank fraud trial when was asked about
his background. Republican leaders knew Serbia was behind on
federal taxes, but Pagani said that because they were being repaid
Republicans were not concerned about that.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Republican leaders expressed frustration that Serbia
had not revealed his indictment to them. ``It sort of like the old
Steve Martin joke,'' said one Rowland campaign official. ``Oh! I
forgot armed robbery was against the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly on Thursday blamed Rowland for not more thoroughly
checking Serbia's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of a governor to ensure that the
people in positions of leadership in state government have the
highest level of personal and professional integrity,'' Mrs.
Kennelly said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his haste to score political points, John Rowland failed to
put the state's best interest first.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly was referring to the ``Rowland rainbow'' that the
governor had assembled for his underticket. Running with Rowland
and Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell are Santa Mendoza, a woman of Mexican
descent who is running for attorney general and Ben Andrews Jr., an
African-American and former president of the Connecticut NAACP
running for secretary of the state. Serbia was born in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been criticized by Rowland for having only one
minority candidate on their ticket. Denise Nappier, who is black,
is running for treasurer, but she is facing a primary challenge
from Frank Lecce, a white man who had vied for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Democrats were happy to note that the Republican
ticket problem resulted from a desire to balance their ticket
regardless of a person's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of mistakes are the by-product of a closed-door
process in which the goal was political points, the goal was
political pandering,''said Jonathan Pelto, Mrs. Kennelly's campaign
director, on Thursday. ``And they paid a price for their haste to
score political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was tapped to run for comptroller, Serbia had been the
state building inspector from 1995-97 and then was assistant to the
state treasurer in charge of economic and community development, a
position he left recently to focus on campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Juan Star, Serbia was acquitted of eight
counts of aiding and abetting a vice president of a bank in Puerto
Rico in a scheme in which they prepared false loan documents, then
used the money from the loan for themselves. Serbia said he was
duped by the vice president, who had pleaded nolo contendere to the
charges, then testified against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Juan Star article, Serbia said he was eating lunch
when a secretary came to ask him to sign some documents. ``With the
napkin still in my waist, I went to the lawyer's office and asked,
`where do I sign?''' the newspaper quotes Serbia as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic incumbent, Comptroller Nancy Wyman, said Thursday
she was surprised by the allegations, but said she would continue
running on her strong record. Asked if a person who had signed
blank documents should be running for comptroller, a job of
overseeing the state's finances, she said: ``I won't sign anything
until I read it and understand it. I know what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing his candidacy, Serbia, an
architect who once ran for mayor of San Juan, he said he had a
degrees from the University of Florida in Gainesville, the
University of Puerto Rico, the University of St. Louis, Parks
College of Aeronautical Technology and Alexander Hamilton Institute
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Florida and the University of
Puerto Rico confirmed he had received bachelor's degrees at their
schools. But an official at St. Louis University said Serbia had
attended but not received a degree.
</P>
<P>
   And Alexander Hamilton Institute, now in Ramsey, N.J., was never
an accredited college, but instead offered correspondence courses
in business administration. The institute is now solely a
publishing house, an official there said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has also had significant federal tax problems. The IRS
placed a lien against Serbia in October 1992 for taxes due in 1988
and 1989 of $8,910.51, which was released in February once he paid
all taxes, interest and penalties, according to the IRS. The
Connecticut secretary of the state's office had record of a second
lien, but did not have the amount available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia told the Hartford Courant that he is paying another $300
monthly to the IRS on a 1997 tax bill of either $4,000 or $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Hartford Courant, he also was alleged to have
not kept up child support payment for his ex-wife, but said that
was a record-keeping error in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani, Rowland's campaign manager, said resumes for possible
new comptroller candidates had already been arriving at Republican
headquarters Thursday, and DePino said the party hoped to name a
replacement in a week to 10 days. They wouldn't talk about possible
candidates, but two people whose names had been floated this spring
_ state Rep. Marilyn Hess of Greenwich, and Alan Schlesinger,
former mayor of Derby _ were being mentioned again Thursday for
comptroller.

METS' HUNDLEY WAKES UP ON 3-FOR-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Hundley did not get much sleep Wednesday night.
But he had a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat up half the night looking at videotapes,'' Hundley said
before Thursday's noontime game with the San Francisco Giants at
Shea Stadium. ``Seth and I were on the phone until about 1
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Hundley and his agent, Seth Levinson, learned from
their separate viewings of Hundley at bat, it worked. Hundley
entered Thursday's game with a .161 batting average in his first 24
games, no home runs and only six runs batted in. He went 3 for 3,
with two singles sandwiched around a hard-hit double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for Todd,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.
``Yesterday was the first day he sat against a right-hander. And
today, he came out with a vengeance. He looked very relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley had appeared to be overswinging. He said he worked on
changing to a more fluid motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play the outfield, you have a lot of energy and you
take that energy up to the plate,'' said Hundley, who is being
converted from catcher to outfielder. ``On a scale of 1 to 10,
you're at a 10. I need to relax and not try to hit it 10 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Piazza Saga Goes On
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips said he has had some discussions
with Mike Piazza and his representatives and that he has not been
told that Piazza will test the free-agent market after this season.
When asked if the plan was still to try and re-sign Piazza,
Phillips said: ``I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is no secret in the Mets' clubhouse that Piazza seems
unhappy with his situation. Those close to him are saying the
all-star catcher will go the free-agent route.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who had little to say after Thursday's game, seemed
upset when Valentine removed him in a double switch in the eighth
inning of a game that the Mets were leading by 6-5, a move
Valentine later called a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   In went Todd Pratt as catcher while Greg McMichael entered as
the pitcher. The switch enabled Pratt to bat third in the bottom of
the eighth in what had been the pitcher's slot. But when the Giants
called on the right-hander Robb Nen to protect their 8-6 lead with
runners on first and second and none out, Valentine pinch-hit for
Pratt with the left-handed hitting Jorge Fabregas. Fabregas
delivered a run-scoring groundout to leave the Mets trailing, 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were still down a run when what would have been
Piazza's turn to bat came in the ninth. Valentine used Matt Franco
as a pinch-hitter for Turk Wendell, the pitcher, and Franco
responded with a single that moved John Olerud from first to third
and was instrumental in the winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza went 0-for-4 to more cheers than boos. Before the game,
Phillips again said he thought Piazza was pressing. As for the
boos?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it,'' Phillips said. ``It's not exclusive to
Mike. It's the way the fans in New York communicate their feelings
about someone's performance at any given time. Whatever the
underlying reason, it does have an impact. But that's part of
playing in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   There's No In-Between
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips pointed to the booing as an incentive for his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can get the job done,'' said Phillips, who went
4-for-5 with a double and a homer to raise his average in six games
as a Met to .385. ``I know if I don't, I'll get booed, so I don't
have much choice. Being booed doesn't feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``To-ny, To-ny'' do feel good, however. Phillips
joined New York knowing that if he performed, he would win over
fans quickly and that if he did not, he would hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no in-between,'' the 39-year-old outfielder said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Valentine said that Phillips has given him more than
he expected. Valentine also added that he almost did not start
Phillips Thursday because of the quick turnaround from Wednesday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if that old body could do it,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii Doesn't Feel Snakebit
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii, who has not won since May 27 despite four strong
outings in a row, was asked if he felt a little snakebit. ``I would
feel snakebit if the team kept on losing,'' Yoshii said through his
interpreter. ``It's nice to get a win for yourself. But I'm happy
because we won today.''
</P>
<P>
   John Franco's two-year contract extension will pay him a base
salary of $6.15 million _ $2.8 million next season and $3.15
million in the year 2000.

FORD SUPERSTORE PLAN HITS ROADBLOCK, MAY BE PERMANENTLY STALLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. has scrapped plans for an
automobile superstore after encountering problems pulling dealers
together for a new complex in suburban Burbank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a dealership will be built in the eastern San Fernando
Valley area without Ford's help remains unclear. While Burbank's
city manager was optimistic, one of the dealers involved called the
plan dead, and the other dealer involved refused to say whether he
was still pursuing a dealership in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which has already paid $12.75 million for an eight-acre
site fronting the Golden State Freeway, envisioned forming a Ford
Retail Network with at least two of the partners being Bert
Boeckmann, owner of Galpin Motors in suburban North Hills, and Ed
Jussen, owner of Star Ford and Star Lincoln Mercury in nearby
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what killed the deal, which also included Magic Ford and
Magic Lincoln Mercury in Valencia, 25 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Jussen said he declined to participate in the project after
learning his Glendale dealerships would eventually be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead,'' Jussen said of the plan. ``The last word I had
from Ford was that they were unable to put the project together.
It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeckmann, who sold more Fords than any other dealer in the
country in 1997, said the terms of the deal simply were not to his
liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had 75 percent of Glendale, and he was very
willing to sell it,'' he added. ``I didn't want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Ford Investment Enterprises Corp. in Dearborn,
Mich., which oversees the retail networks, refused to discuss the
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't comment on this particular situation,'' said
spokesman John Oakes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeckmann has been involved with the Burbank project for more
than a year. Initially, he planned to buy the land in the 700 block
of Front Street near Burbank Boulevard from Zero Corp., which used
it for a manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was then structured so that Ford bought the land and
Boeckmann would put up the buildings. He would purchase the land
once construction was complete and run the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Burbank City Council kicked in some incentives
to bring the business to town, including giving Boeckmann a
60-by-1,000-foot strip of land valued at $2.4 million and loaning
him $3 million at 7 percent interest to help defray construction
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The city also agreed to pay Boeckmann an amount equal to 50
percent of the sales tax generated by the new dealership in its
first 10 years or until $9 million was grossed, whichever came
first.
</P>
<P>
   Boeckmann earlier estimated that it would cost $16 million to
build the new dealership.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to address his specific plans for the Burbank site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving in a different direction,'' Boeckmann said. ``We
are not releasing any details . . . until things are finalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Robert R. ``Bud'' Ovrom said the latest
development is a setback, but not a fatal blow, to establishing an
auto center in town.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has taken title to the land -- well-suited for a
dealership because of its visibility from the Golden State Freeway
-- Boeckmann has an option to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the reasons for our optimism,'' Ovrom said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said while the retail network was a factory-sponsored
plan, Boeckmann can still develop his own auto retail project. The
agreement with the city allows him to proceed with any three
franchises from Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and
Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the project Boeckmann first proposed was a GM Village
with Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Cadillac and GMC
trucks, Ovrom said.

BEFORE THE TV CLICKER, WATCHING WAS A SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Klein died in his sleep last month. Among other things, the
former NBC researcher and programmer, who made his reputation in
the 1960s and 1970s, created the ``L.O.P.'' theory.
</P>
<P>
   L.O.P. means least objectionable program. In its obituary, the
New York Times sniffed that Klein ``enjoyed modest fame in the
television industry'' for his theory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a theory a couch potato could love. Klein knew that
people parked themselves in front of the TV set at night and stayed
there until they trundled off to bed. It was an ingrained habit,
and viewers would stay put and watch shows so long as they weren't
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Klein would even insist that a network could maintain a 10 share
_ a 10th of the viewing audience _ with a test pattern. People
simply didn't want to get up and turn the dial.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1980, NBC captured a meager 9 share with a cultural
special called ``Live From Studio 8H.'' Grant Tinker, who'd later
become chairman of NBC, recalled in his memoir, ``Tinker in
Television,'' that Klein had an explanation for that awful 9 share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers hated this program so much,'' Tinker quoted Klein as
saying, ``that all across America, thousands of disabled people
threw themselves out of bed and crawled to the set, on their
elbows, just to turn the dial.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the L.O.P. theory is pretty much a relic from the big
networks' halcyon days.
</P>
<P>
   People have remote controls now. No more heaving yourself toward
the set to change channels. The three-network hegemony is over.
Cable has fragmented the audience so much that there's actually a
viable market for objectionable programs. How else to explain
``South Park''? Nintendo and the Internet vie for attention. In
1998, a 10 share is starting to look respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's notion that viewers would stay put so long as they
weren't offended seemingly applies only to a few nooks and crannies
on today's television landscape.
</P>
<P>
   One is Friday night on ABC, where the ``TGIF'' package has long
given middle-American families a simplistic slate of shows they can
watch without chronic moments of awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Thursday-night lineup is probably the best surviving
example. Grab the audience, then don't give it a compelling reason
to split. With strong shows at 8, 9 and 10 p.m., NBC has been able
to pull ratings with subpar shows at 8:30 and 9:30. On paper, ``The
Single Guy'' was a monster hit; in actuality, its ``popularity''
was a bag of gas.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans all over the dial _ well, really there is no dial
anymore _ and all over the house, Klein's theory has been replaced
by a costly search for ``appointment'' television.
</P>
<P>
   The object now is to develop distinct hits that fickle viewers
will fight to find, rather than a seamless stream of inoffensive
programs for the indiscriminate masses. ``Ally McBeal'' is an
appointment show. ``The X-Files.'' ``Dawson's Creek.'' ``South
Park,'' sad to say. ``Frasier,'' as a Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
   Appointment TV is a naturally bloody approach to programming.
It's every show for itself. What once would have fit into schedules
as solid, conventional shows _ a ``George &AMP; Leo,'' say, or maybe a
``Michael Hayes'' from last fall _ are dying in droves. Nearly 40
new series premiered last autumn; four were renewed for a second
season.
</P>
<P>
   So Klein's theory, not so modest as his obit suggested, preceded
him in death.
</P>
<P>
   As for Klein himself, he'd helped form a pay-per-view movie
service for hotel rooms in the 1970s, between his two stints at
NBC, and in 1982 he founded the Playboy Channel.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, he set ``Holocaust,'' ``Shogun'' and ``Centennial'' into
production. Also ``Supertrain,'' a legendary flop in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Big stuff. But the Times didn't identify Klein in the obit
headline as NBC's research director or vice president for programs.
No, he was ``a developer of pay-per-view TV channels.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC? That was merely a network, whatever networks used to be.

PANEL APPROVES MONEY FOR OUSTED CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual move, a House panel has awarded
Robert Dornan, the conservative former congressman, $320,526 in
expenses for his unsuccessful effort to overturn his 1996
California election defeat. His opponent, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a
Democrat, was awarded $250,500, $70,000 less than Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted earlier this year to seat Ms. Sanchez after the
Committee on House Oversight found there was not enough evidence to
overturn the election. Dornan is running against Ms. Sanchez to
reclaim his seat in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision on Wednesday to award money to both sides
in the dispute infuriated Democrats, who said it was unprecedented
to give taxpayer money to the loser in a contested election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of money, he's down in the polls and he's a terrible
candidate,'' said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., chairman of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ``So what do they do? They give him
$320,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee decided to reimburse both Dornan and Ms. Sanchez
for their lawyers' fees, but it opted not to pay expenses involving
court actions. As a result, Ms. Sanchez, who spent close to $75,000
in expenses challenging the constitutionality of a series of House
subpoenas, was awarded less money.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the committee, said the
panel had wide latitude in reimbursing members and challengers for
``reasonable'' expenses. The panel, Thomas said, deemed the
reimbursement appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a payment for his attorney, for his attorneys' fees,''
not for Dornan's campaign, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats for months engaged in a rancorous
partisan battle over Ms. Sanchez's election, which Dornan
maintained was tainted by the votes of undocumented immigrants and
unregistered voters. Ms. Sanchez won the race by 984 votes. In the
end, the House committee investigating the matter found that 748
noncitizens had voted, an insufficient number to overturn the
election.

FAN'S SPIRIT, ASHES WITH `MO-NI-CA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD _ Two of Monica Seles' biggest fans, Catherine
Trachtenberg and John Alexander, are here this week for the Toshiba
Tennis Classic. They'll also be in Manhattan Beach next week for
the Acura Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Trachtenberg is the one in the shorts and sandles. Alexander is
the one in the little cloth bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Mo-ni-ca!'' Trachtenberg screamed from the third row
at the La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa stadium as Seles defeated Sandrine
Testud in two tough sets Wednesday night. ``For Jonathan!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Jonathan?'' said the box-seat holder in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother,'' Trachtenberg said. She lifted the bag off her
lap and held it up to the other woman's eyes. ``In here.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachtenberg, a registered nurse, lives in Winnetka, in the San
Fernando Valley. As she tells the story, her brother died in
January at age 42 after having a heart attack in Gainesville, Fla.,
and was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Each of six relatives received a portion of the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   And just what is some of Alexander doing on his sister's lap at
center court?
</P>
<P>
   Trachtenberg said her brother was confined to a wheelchair for
the last 14 years of his life following a motorcycle accident, and
he felt an understandable bitterness. One of the times he felt
whole was when he attended tennis matches, especially when he
watched Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Trachtenberg said they met when she and Alexander complimented
Seles after a practice during the Manhattan Beach tournament in
1990. She said Seles' mother snapped a photograph of them
Trachtenberg still has. And the player then ranked No.2 in the
world left tickets to the late rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go to a tennis tournament in a wheelchair,'' said
Pam O'Connor, Trachtenberg's stepsister from Texas, who is here on
vacation. ``He'd have to sit in a special section and he'd feel
like people were staring at him. She (Seles) got him tickets that
put him in a section where he didn't feel like a disabled person.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trachtenberg brings her brother to Seles' matches whenever
she's in Southern California. She even sprinkled some of the ashes
in the grass under her court-side seat. She plans to do the same
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spreading his spirit around,'' O'Connor calls that.
</P>
<P>
   The stepsisters say Alexander could get loud and obnoxious at
times. And they remember that for whatever reason, Seles related to
him surprisingly easily in their brief encounter. Now, the box-seat
neighbors might say, Trachtenberg is loud and obnoxious enough for
two, cheering ``Mo-ni-ca'' with more emotion than anybody else in
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, shut up,'' a guy in the front row muttered.
</P>
<P>
   Some people never will understand.

   A Security Flaw is Found in Eudora E-mail Software
</P>
<P>
   Just days after a security flaw was revealed in two popular
electronic mail programs, an equally troubling vulnerability has
been discovered in Eudora, the most widely used of all e-mail
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora flaw makes it possible for a computer user to
booby-trap an e-mail message by inserting a seemingly harmless link
to an Internet location that executes a malignant code. This could
permit an attacker to destroy or steal data or to tamper with a
personal computer.

   Slower Growth at American Express
</P>
<P>
   Shares of American Express fell 6.8 percent, or $7.375, to
$101.0625, after the company warned that its growth overseas would
be hampered by the Asian financial crisis and a broader softening
of the global economy. The chief executive of American Express,
Harvey Golub, told analysts that the current slowdown is hurting
both the travel services and credit card businesses.

   Sunbeam Plans to Restate Earnings
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam expects to restate its financial statements for 1997 and
possibly for 1996 and the first quarter of this year, because of
possible accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   EDS Chief Resigns
</P>
<P>
   Lester Alberthal Jr., chairman and chief executive of Electronic
Data Systems, has resigned. Shares of the company have declined
since it was spun off from General Motors in 1996. It has also lost
its lead in the computer services industry to IBM and several major
contracts have proved less profitable than anticipated for EDS.
Alberthal was the company's second leader after its founder, Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom Bonds Are Well Received
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom sold a record $6.1 billion of bonds, attracting strong
demand in a choppy and worried corporate bond market. The sale
brought the total of corporate bond issuance so far in 1998 to more
than $560 billion.
</P>
<P>
   New Chief is Reviving Donna Karan
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan International has started to turn around under the
guidance of its new chief executive, John Idol. Revenue rose 12.5
percent in the second quarter and the apparel manufacturing company
narrowed its loss by 57.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Factory Orders Rose 0.1 Percent in June
</P>
<P>
   Orders to factories rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in June,
held back by slumping demand for aircraft and autos.
</P>
<P>
   Retail Sales Rose 4.8 Percent in July
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales at stores open at least a year jumped 4.8 percent
last month, the best July gain since 1993, when sales rose 5.4
percent. Specialty apparel stores and off-price clothing merchants
were the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment Dips in Germany
</P>
<P>
   The German unemployment rate fell to 10.9 percent, the lowest

</P>
<P>
   Russia's Economic Problems Grow

SEEKING JESUS UNDER THE TENT IN CITY LOTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the Rev. John H. Boyd Sr. stepped up to
the pulpit beneath his gospel big top the other night, his audience
had already been on its feet for some time, swaying to the music
that pulsated from towering stacks of loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Like teen-agers screaming for a rock idol, grown men and women _
perhaps 1,500 of them, in tailored suits and beaded gowns, in
sundresses and blue jeans _ cheered wildly as they reached their
arms skyward and toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, listen,'' the pastor pleaded. ``You got to hear what
God is saying. I don't care what happened yesterday, it's your time
to be blessed tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ``Yes, Lord'' and ``Thank you, Jesus'' rang out in the
warm night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every promise you've been waiting for, tonight is the night,''
Boyd thundered. ``It'll happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter that the preacher could barely be
heard above the pounding of the organ and the shouting of the
congregation. The wall-less sanctuary shook with energy as the
crowd at the makeshift church settled in for a night's worth of
communing with God: the foot-stomping, hand-clapping,
throat-crackling kind that evokes nothing so much as summer in the
Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of sitting in a field somewhere below the
Mason-Dixon line, this tent was planted in a sprawling vacant lot
in South Jamaica, Queens, surrounded by scrap iron vendors and auto
repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   A rural tradition that slaves adopted as their own when they
were denied the luxury of four walls for religious observances,
outdoor revival meetings like Boyd's arrived in Northern cities
with the blacks who came seeking work at the turn of the century.
Over the years, tent revivals in vacant lots across New York have
become as much a part of summertime as humidity and haze.
</P>
<P>
   The tents usually go up for three or four weeks at a time, in
neighborhoods in southeastern Queens and parts of Brooklyn and the
Bronx. Most tents hold afternoon and evening services that last
from two to four hours. And while tent revivals of yore in the city
were fairly simple operations with a few folding chairs and a light
bulb or two powered by an extension cord, tents today have become
much more elaborate, with booming sound systems, floodlights and
multitiered altars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tent is just like church _ only the walls have been rolled
up so that everybody can see what goes on,'' said Pam Dye, a member
of Boyd's New Greater Bethel Ministries, based in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   For the churches, the tents are an informal and open setting for
spreading the word and attracting new members. For the congregants,
they offer a warm and ready sense of community that often recalls
childhood in the South or the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   To Willie Tolliver, a professor at the Hunter College School of
Social Work who has studied the black church, the tent revivals are
somewhat akin to the increasingly popular retreats of corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for a special rekindling of the spirit,'' he
said. ``But it's also an opportunity to bring in new believers or
people who have fallen away, or as they say in the black church,
people who have backslid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Are there more tents out there these days bringing in the
backsliders? The experts say they really do not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tent meetings now are a little bit like storefront churches,''
explained the Rev. Charles Rawlings, director of urban programs at
the National Council of Churches. ``They're episodic, and you don't
really know when or where they're going to pop up next.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Atiles, who coordinated a three-week tent revival in
July for the Tabernacle of Prayer in Jamaica, said, ``Part of the
reason you don't see even more tents in the city is because there
isn't a considerable amount of land to make it easy to put up a big
tent, especially in densely populated areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The billboard for the Tabernacle of Prayer's tent urged
passers-by to bring ``the sick and afflicted'' and ``the down and
out'' for some ``Old Fashion Holy Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   Atiles said the church decided to rent a vacant lot in downtown
Jamaica for its twice-daily revival meetings because of the area's
heavy pedestrian traffic. It did not hurt that there was a homeless
shelter across the street. In addition to giving the shelter
residents a place to spend a few hours every day, the church also
provided free meals each Friday. ``You've got to catch the fish
before you clean it,'' Atiles said.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of New Greater Bethel's bright yellow-and-blue tent
caught Linda Gourdine's eye one afternoon and reeled her in, even
though she is a member of a different church. ``I saw the tent as I
was riding on the bus, and I decided to come back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gourdine said she was heartened by the thought that she was
probably surrounded by people who ordinarily would not go to a
service at all because they were intimidated by the stained glass
and dress code of a church. She also said that the services
reminded her of South Carolina, where she spent every summer as a
child, visiting family and listening to her grandfathers, both
preachers, who often held forth at open-air meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being back there again,'' she said. ``I like the
atmosphere, being outdoors and close to nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, the 77-year-old pastor of New Greater Bethel, has pitched
a tent somewhere in the city every summer since 1972. He said he
started planning his summer revivals months in advance, lining up
nationally known evangelists as guest speakers for the nighttime
services.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said in the five weeks under the tent, the church would
collect about $75,000 in offerings, a large sum but not enough to
cover the estimated $100,000 in costs. In addition to renting the
city-owned lot, the church also had to pay for a temporary power
line, two air-conditioned trailers for the preachers and staff,
portable toilets, the main tent and two smaller ones _ one used as
a bookstore and another used as a child-care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the red this year, but it costs money to
restructure people's lives,'' the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Curtis, a public hospital worker, said going to the tent
each night for five weeks had indeed changed her life. ``Before I
was out there partying and having a good time,'' she said. ``I was
out in the flesh, and now I'm in the spirit. And people ask me:
`Girl, what's gotten into you? You're glowing all over the
place.'''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: BRYAN COX'S TEMPER MASKS A GOOD SIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The problem with Bryan Cox, now a linebacker with
the New York Jets, is that over the years he has been his own worst
enemy. Reporters love to chronicle players with big mouths who say
obnoxious things, make obscene gestures to fans and tell the
commissioner he knows what he can do with his fines. Even if you
act like the pope off the field, that image of a chronic bad boy is
forever forged by the media if you constantly act the fool on the
50-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League was once irritated with the Miami
Dolphins after they nominated Cox their man of the year because of
all the charity work he was doing in his free time. Since Cox has
paid over $100,000 in fines and always seemed to be on the ESPN
highlights screaming at officials, at first glance you can't blame
the league for being a little annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   But what has been lost in Cox's uncanny ability to self-destruct
is that in his eight seasons in the NFL there have been fewer
better off-the-field role models. The good deeds he has done away
from football have become overshadowed by what has happened on the
field. Quietly, Cox has been one of football's most charitable men.
</P>
<P>
   Few know of the tens of thousands of dollars he has given to
various charities. Or how when he was with the Dolphins, every
Tuesday, the only day players have off during the regular season,
Cox would go to the rough neighborhoods in the Miami area and speak
with youngsters about the importance of staying in school. After
one Monday night game in San Diego, the team flew all night back to
Miami, landing at 5 a.m. Cox went home, showered, and three hours
later was speaking at a school.
</P>
<P>
   He did this every week, among many other generous acts. There
was little fanfare, few headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Cox has even treated the news media with respect.
When a Dolphins rookie once boycotted the Miami media because he
was upset with them for making fun of the fact that he had seven
toes, Cox told the player that speaking to the media was part of
his job. The player talked.
</P>
<P>
   The good deeds, though, have seemingly been outweighed by the
bad ones. Cox has thrown helmets, he has been kicked out of games
and once cursed so many times with television cameras rolling, all
that viewers could hear was a steady stream of bleeps. Several
years ago, he taunted the entire Cincinnati Bengals bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is no fun to me,'' Cox has said. ``I don't want to be
associated with people who accept losing. I don't accept losing.
Sometimes that causes me to go berserk.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox is no longer the player he was, a three-time Pro Bowl
selection who could dominate a game. In the Jets' exhibition game
against the Philadelphia Eagles last night, he played sparingly,
which must seem strange for a player who when healthy played almost
all the time, in every game. What you get with Cox now is a
hot-blooded fighter who relies more on the fire instead of pure
physical skills. NFL scouts say the best the Jets can hope for from
Cox is a solid pass rush on third downs. He no longer has great
speed, or NFL caliber physical strength, so he tends to
overcompensate with passion. Sometimes, those emotions spill onto
the field like an oil slick.
</P>
<P>
   What Cox needs is an edit mode between his brain and his mouth.
The Chicago Bears' releasing him on June 2 did not change him in
the least, and there is no question he will blow up again. There
will be another incident. Bryan Cox wouldn't be Bryan Cox without
one.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how will the Jets, both players and coaches,
handle that explosion when it comes? The last two coaches Cox
played for, Don Shula in Miami and Dave Wannstedt in Chicago, gave
up trying to understand or change him. Coach Bill Parcells can do
both. Parcells is a lot of things, mainly a boisterous bully with a
Hall of Fame ability to coach football players.He has his faults,
but he is able to get what he wants out of players.
</P>
<P>
   When Cox pulls one of his stunts, Parcells has both the clout
and the skill to stop it cold. Besides, the Jets signed Cox to just
a one-year deal worth $500,000 with no signing bonus, which is
pocket change in the NFL. If his act suddenly gets old again, the
Jets can put him back on the street.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Cox has is a life outside of football. He has taken
care of his money so he's not playing for a paycheck. What he's
playing for now is a chance to win again. Maybe that is just enough
to prevent him from ending up on the wrong side of a headline. &QL;

RICHIE POWERS, 67, LONGTIME NBA REF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y.)  (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richie Powers, whose 23 years as a National Basketball
Association referee ended in bitterness, died last Friday in Lehigh
Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pa., where he lived. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   His sister and only survivor, Alice Powers of White Plains,
N.Y., said he suffered a stroke the day before he died. She said he
had a heart condition for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a New York City native, played baseball at St. John's
University and later umpired in the Eastern League. He refereed in
the NBA from 1956 to 1979, working three All-Star Games and 25
games in playoff finals.
</P>
<P>
   He once recalled: ``I used to come out on the court, and my two
feet would hit the floor _ boom, boom _ and I'd be home. It was
like: `Beat me if you can. But I dare you. Nothing is going to
happen here tonight that I'm not in control of.'''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, he was in control. ``If I'm working Game
7 of the final series,'' said Earl Strom, another leading referee
of that era, ``Richie is the guy I want across the floor from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But in later years on the job, Powers became erratic. He
infuriated the Boston Celtics and the Phoenix Suns with
questionable calls in Game 5 of the NBA's 1976 playoff finals. ``If
it wasn't for Richie Powers, we would have won that game and
probably the championship,'' Jerry Colangelo, the Suns' owner, said
years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the NBA referees formed a union. When they
struck on the eve of the 1977 playoffs, only Powers and Strom,
neither a member of the union, continued to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake, my not striking,'' Powers said later. ``But
it would have been wrong. I was the only referee with a contract,
and I was morally bound to uphold it. For this, I was ostracized.
My rating among my fellow officials went from the top to virtually
the bottom overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   After those playoffs, Powers applied for the newly vacant job of
supervisor of officials. He did not get it. In February 1978, he
allowed the New Jersey Nets and the Atlanta Hawks to use zone
defenses in a game, even though the rules barred them. The league
suspended him for three weeks and fined him $5,000. That November,
he called extra technical fouls on a coach and a player, again
violating the rules and prompting another suspension and fine.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1978-79 season, he was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his time,'' said Norm Drucker, another NBA referee,
``Richie was a good ref, but he did some weird things. It reached
the point where he couldn't officiate anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a broadcaster for WABC, USA Network and SportsChannel.
When his broadcasting career ended, he became director of
operations in 1985 for the U.S. Basketball League, but by midseason
the NBA had signed away most of the new minor league's best
players. In 1987, his second marriage ended.
</P>
<P>
   He sold cable-television subscriptions, then cars. For six
months, his bed was the back seat of a station wagon on the
showroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 article in the sports daily The National said Powers told
of how he almost committed suicide the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a very depressed state,'' he said. ``I had a great
profession, for which I was very accomplished and dedicated. I felt
I had a positive effect on every game I worked. But I just don't do
much good anymore. For anything or anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he returned to his old job with the USBL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an existence now,'' he said, ``but I haven't got a
life.''

SALOMON SMITH BARNEY EXECUTIVE JOINS GOLDMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Pa., N.Y.)   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Carr, co-head of Salomon Smith Barney's
global mergers and acquisition group, has joined Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. as a managing director in its mergers and acquisitions group.
He will be primarily responsible for covering industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's compensation package was not disclosed. But people close
to the companies said Goldman, Sachs had been offering recruits the
promise of stock as an incentive to join the firm. Goldman, Sachs,
one of Wall Street's premier investment banks, has agreed to sell
shares of the company to the public this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought some high-level recruits could get stock valued
from $10 million to $25 million, a large portion of it vested over
five years, these people said. Carr was contacted only recently by
representatives of the firm about a job. But Goldman, Sachs has
been talking to a select group of bankers and analysts at Wall
Street firms _ some of whom have already rejected offers _ and more
announcements are likely.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not a new one. Investment banker Bob Matschullat,
who had worked at Morgan Stanley in the 1970s and later became a
board member, rejoined Morgan Stanley in 1986 as a managing
director and got stock months before that company went public,
people at that firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr is a graduate of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.,
and received an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania. He joined Salomon Brothers in 1985 out of graduate
school and advised several clients, including Federated Department
Stores, General Dynamics and Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my experience at Salomon,'' he said in an interview
Thursday. ``The attraction of Goldman, Sachs, is its integrity and
the depth of its relationships.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carr's departure is the most recent from Salomon Smith Barney
after the announced merger between Travelers Group, its parent, and
Citicorp. Frank Yeary, a telecommunications banker, left early this
summer to work at the Carlyle Group. Gregg Polle will replace Carr
as co-head of the Salomon group

SUSPENDED JUDGE SENT TO JAIL FOR SIX MONTHS FOR ALCOHOL USE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Suspended Judge Robert C. Bradley
pleaded guilty to violating his probation and was ordered to begin
serving a six-month sentence immediately for an earlier violation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of violating
probation after officers determined that he had been drinking two
days earlier. Santa Barbara Municipal Court Judge Denise de
Bellefville ordered Bradley taken into custody and moved to the
main jail in neighboring Ventura County, where he will be held for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   De Bellefville did not give Bradley additional jail time for his
latest probation violation, said Bill Maile, a spokesman for the
state Attorney General's Office, which prosecuted Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon his release in six months, he is required to put himself
in the custody of the Probation Department and enter a six-month
residential (alcohol) treatment program,'' Maile said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 57, had been on probation since pleading guilty in
February to two drunken-driving offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's arrest Tuesday, his sixth in eight months, came two
weeks after he prematurely left a residential treatment program in
Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were prosecuted by the state Attorney General's Office
and heard by a judge in Santa Barbara to avoid a possibility of a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley remains on paid leave from his job. Although his
judicial term expires at the end of this year, the Commission on
Judicial Performance plans to hold a hearing in October to consider
removing him from office.

EXPOS HUMBLE PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Unlike Mark Grudzielanek, Carlos Perez was cheered in
his return to Olympic Stadium. And when he allowed seven runs in
Thursday's 9-0 Dodgers loss to the Montreal Expos, the place went
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, acquired with Grudzielanek last Friday for Wilton
Guerrero and three minor-leaguers, was a member of the Expos
organization. When he returned this week, he found it difficult to
remember these were no longer friends on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very emotional for me, and I think that hurt,'' said
Perez (7-11). ``I used to be a guy here that people on the street
used to come up to and say hello. I would sign things for them and
give them gum. I'm moving on, but there was still a lot of me here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who pitched seven scoreless innings Saturday in his
Dodgers debut, faced the minimum nine batters in the first three
innings. But in the fourth, he gave up a two-run double to Bob
Henley and a two-run homer to Mike Mordecai.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, he hit center fielder Terry Jones, who later
scored, and lasted only two batters into the sixth. Struggling
Darren Hall came in and allowed two runs, raising his earned run
average to 10.45.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention was on Perez, who was making his
second Dodgers start since breaking his nose in a July 26 auto
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My right shoulder is still a little sore from the accident,
but other than that I am fine,'' said Perez, who patiently answered
questions for more than a half-hour on a getaway day. ``In New
York, my control was bad (six walks), and today it was good (none).
I needed to get this game out of my system. It was hard, but now
it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest ruling: National League President Leonard Coleman will
rule today on a protest by the New York Mets that the Dodgers
illegally inserted second baseman Eric Young into the lineup last
Friday after Guerrero was traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are expected to win the protest. If they lose, the
Dodgers would forfeit the game to the Mets, who lead them by 2{
games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero was traded eight minutes before the first pitch. Young
was on the disabled list and first had to be activated. Infielder
Tripp Cromer was put on the DL, and Young walked to the plate to
start the game.
</P>
<P>
   First-base coach Mickey Hatcher brought the lineup card to home
plate with Guerrero's name at the top, but manager Glenn Hoffman
later notified the umpiring crew of the change. The Mets think
that's a lot to do in less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Len is out of the office, but he will decide (today),'' NL
vice president Katy Feeney said Thursday by phone from New York.
``We tell clubs when they are making a transaction close to game
time they need to let the league office know. They also must advise
the umpires and the opposing team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair ball:!off! One play certain to make the highlight reel came
in the Expos' four-run fourth inning. Wilton Guerrero bunted up the
first-base line. Carlos Perez watched the ball, then got on his
stomach as it came to a stop on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even tried to blow it a little,'' home-plate umpire Mark
Hirschbeck said with a laugh. ``But that ball wasn't going foul no
matter what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually cheerful Perez wasn't so happy. ``Wilton came around
to score,'' he said. ``Maybe if he doesn't, we can come back.''

LOUIMA FILES SUIT, CITING `BLUE WALL' OF SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was
reportedly tortured in a Brooklyn police station, asserted in a
lawsuit Thursday that New York City and the police officers' union
were ultimately responsible for what happened because they had
jointly encouraged a ``blue wall'' of silence that fostered police
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit brought in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, lawyers
for Louima claimed that the policies, customs and practices of the
Police Department and the union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, ``have promoted an atmosphere in which the very worst
police officers feel assured that evidence of misdeeds depriving
citizens of their civil rights, no matter how awful, will be hidden
by PBA representatives and the `code of silence.'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to naming the city and the union as defendants, the
suit _ which does not specify the amount of damages being sought _
also includes as defendants the five officers who have been charged
in a criminal case with attacking Louima or with trying to cover up
the attack, and three former supervisors of the precinct involved
in the case. The former supervisors are accused of failures of
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the city's Law Department, Lorna Goodman, said
she could not comment on the suit because her agency had not
received a copy of it. But a spokesman for the police officers'
union, Joseph Mancini, termed the suit ``without merit as it
applies to the PBA.'' He said that ``shortly after the incident,
the PBA publicly encouraged police officers to come forward with
what they knew about this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the suit claimed that the union and several of its
officials, who are also named as defendants, ``suppressed''
admissions of criminal behavior they had received from police
officers and ``adopted a strategy of obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   As Louima, 31, stood by without speaking in the downtown
Manhattan office of two of his lawyers, one of them, Johnnie
Cochran Jr., said that the suit was ``not necessarily about money''
but about attacking the ``endemic societal problem of police
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Peter Neufeld, said this goal explained why the
defendants were not only the city and the officers charged in the
brutality _ the usual parties in such suits _ but the union, police
officers ``who stood by and did nothing'' and supervisors whose
failures ``amounted to gross negligence, deliberate indifference or
intentional misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima's cousin and spokesman, Samuel Nicolas, said he planned
to use part of any damage award to aid victims of police brutality
and to support officers who want to expose such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Also named as defendants are the two members of the city
ambulance crew that responded to the precinct station house when
``finally summoned'' by police to treat a severely injured Louima
after he had been beaten and tortured, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   They charged that the two, William Pagan and Frank Birnbaum,
members of the Emergency Medical Service, ``delayed treatment'' of
Louima and aided a police coverup by intentionally omitting in
their ambulance call report ``Mr. Louima's statements to them that
he had been beaten by police officers and had a stick shoved into''
his rectum. Pagan and Birnbaum could not be reached Thursday
through their union or the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Justin Volpe, one of the officers charged with
torturing Louima, said his client denied the civil suit claims,
just as he denied the criminal charges he faces. And despite
Cochran's statement that money was not the prime consideration,
Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, contended that ``Louima has had
monetary reasons for telling the story he has told.''

JUDGE INVOKES PUBLIC HEALTH TO SHUT STRIP BAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state Supreme Court justice ordered the padlocking
of a second strip club in Manhattan Thursday and indicated in his
ruling that it could be difficult for such clubs to remain open
under a restrictive new zoning law, even if they devote just a
fraction of their floor space to nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Justice Stephen Crane, did not rule on attempts
by video stores to stay in business under the Giuliani
administration's new anti-sex-shop law by using a similar tactic:
devoting the majority of their stock and floor space to non-sexual
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Crane made his ruling about the strip club, Angels, after police
officers testified that they found evidence of sexual activity and
possible prostitution during an inspection on Wednesday night. He
said the club on Walker Street in downtown Manhattan posed a public
health threat.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also suggested in his ruling that attempts by clubs to
scale back their operations as a way to remain open under the
restrictive new law will be strictly judged for compliance, and may
not pass muster in court.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, strip clubs are trying to take advantage of
wording in the new law that describes a business as adult if its
``substantial use,'' in legal terms, is adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said in court that ``substantial use'' means
more than 40 percent of a store or club's floor space or stock is
devoted to adult entertainment. In Angels and other strip clubs,
owners have restricted nude dancing to small, screened-off areas
that make up less than 40 percent of their floor space in the hope
of no longer being considered an ``adult establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crane said in his ruling that the use of a series of
Japanese Shoji screens by Angels to block off a stage where women
danced nude was not enough to make the club a non-adult
establishment. He pointed out that activities that could be
considered adult entertainment were occurring ``throughout'' the
basement strip club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attempt to abide by the 40 percent rule'' through the use
of the screens, the judge said, ``doesn't quite do the job of
separating adult from non-adult entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the club was failing to abide by its own version of
the 40 percent rule. Detective Richard Providence testified
Thursday that when he entered Angels on Wednesday evening, the
club's ``transvestite night,'' he saw customers fondling fully
clothed female and transvestite dancers in the part of the club
theoretically considered ``non-adult.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel Connolly, the corporation counsel lawyer arguing the case
on the city's behalf, said Thursday that officers also recently
discovered evidence of sexual activity in the Harmony II strip club
on West 22nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing Monday, Crane ordered the Harmony Theater on
Church Street padlocked after city officials presented evidence of
sexual activity there.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has so far not granted the city's requests to

TV SPORTS: BEST NHL ACTION IS THE BATTLE OVER TV RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a good year for Gary Bettman, the National Hockey
League commissioner. First, he met the owner of the Tampa Bay
Lightning, whom no league official had seen, then he helped
engineer the team's sale. And this week, without wishing upon a
star, Bettman got a $600 million, five-year offer from the Walt
Disney Co. to carry the NHL on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when you're the recipient of a $120 million-a-year bid _
and your league has been getting an average of $45 million annually
from Fox and ESPN _ you don't ask Michael Eisner, the chairman of
Disney, if he's gone a smidgen goofy.
</P>
<P>
   No, you are one grateful and gleeful commissioner, who certainly
knows that in the 1991-92 season, which preceded his tenure, the
NHL's entire take from U.S. television rights came to $5.5 million.
The league had only a cable-rights holder then, SportsChannel
America. No broadcast network wanted in.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're Gary Bettman, you don't ask Disney why it's doing
what it's doing. You simply say, ``Michael, your investment is even
dandier than staging `The Lion King' on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   But it looks only to be a good investment for the lucky NHL. Who
would have thought this would happen after U.S. players trashed
property at the Winter Olympics? Or when Fox's regular season
Nielsen rating slid to a 1.4? Or when Detroit won the Stanley Cup
with the fourth consecutive four-game sweep?
</P>
<P>
   You must wonder what Disney's strategy is beyond guaranteeing
that hockey will stay on ESPN and ESPN2 for five more years.
Clearly, this is heavily a cable play, with $350 million of the bid
ascribed to ESPN and ESPN2. In buying National Football League
rights, ESPN is paying $600 million a year for Sunday night rights,
more than ABC's $550 million for ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   But adding ABC to the mix is dumbfounding. Does ABC, a
struggling network, need more low-rated programming? Wouldn't its
affiliates prefer an eighth-run flick to a Saturday or Sunday night
game that gets a 1.4 rating?
</P>
<P>
   Does ABC think that ousting Fox from the money-losing hockey
broadcasting business will make its overlord, Rupert Murdoch, cry
for his glowing pucks?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 can cross-promote hockey
(``Nightline'' can glide right from a report on Kosovo to a Pavel
Bure hockey spot, eh?), but the rewards will be slim compared with
those of the cross-promotion ESPN and ABC are now engaged in to
make absolutely certain we know beyond a reasonable doubt about
their full seasons of Sunday and Monday night football.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC is stepping into a quagmire. At Fox, ratings have fallen
only 33 percent since 1996, but ratings among key demographics are
tumbling. Between 1995 and 1998, the rating among men 18 to 34 has
fallen from a 2.2 to a 1.3. And last year, the teen-age male
demographic fell from a 1.3 to an 0.8.
</P>
<P>
   ABC shouldn't contemplate putting an All-Star Game in
prime-time. Fox's 2.8 rating for the 1997 event stands as the
lowest prime-time rating ever.
</P>
<P>
   And ABC will surely remember that when it carried NHL games
last, in 1994, the barely promoted schedule managed a 1.7 average
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy promotion by Fox, the NHL has an even lower
rating, 1.4. ESPN, also a vigorous marketer, saw its rating slide
last year, from a 0.8 to a 0.7.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN2 rating stayed flat at 0.4.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Disney sees benefits to making a blockbuster bid. The Mouse
Kingdom's target for such spending is questionable enough, but why
do it at a time when big losses are expected from the stupendous
NFL deals? At least Disney has reasons for its wild NFL spending:
``Monday Night Football'' is a top-five prime-time program, and
football is ESPN's highest-rated sport.
</P>
<P>
   But hockey? Does Disney know something about hockey's future the
rest of us don't? The emergence of a dozen astonishing superstars?
The amazing impact of adding Nashville, St. Paul and Columbus to
the league's national footprint? Five consecutive Rangers Stanley
Cup titles to start the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Can Eisner foretell that ABC's hockey rating will suddenly rise
to Fox's 2.7 baseball rating, soar to ABC's, CBS's and NBC's
combined 2.9 golf rating or rocket to CBS's 4.3 NASCAR rating?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will come down to corporate egos. Disney and Fox
dislike each other for many reasons, if only because they are
powerful entities, with different styles and lots of money, that
are building sports kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Disney opted to overpay to make sure it swept Fox from
hockey. Fox can counter, by Aug. 14, with a bid to keep the
broadcast rights and let ESPN and ESPN2 simply renew their cable
deal. But if Fox plays hardpuck it could match Disney on the
broadcast side and try to outbid Disney on the cable level. If
successful, a Fox double play would force ESPN and ESPN2 to
scramble for replacement programming for four combined games per
week. But just as ABC made sure it would outbid NBC to guarantee it
would keep ``Monday Night Football,'' it's unlikely that Disney
would let the cable package be wrested away by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But by not quickly bidding adieu to the NHL after being told of
Disney's bid, Fox is sending a mixed signal: Either it is seriously
considering a counteroffer or it wants to make Disney sweat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the coolest game on earth.

NEW YORK STATE SUED OVER DENYING FOODSTAMPS TO SOME IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to restore benefits to thousands of needy
legal immigrants, lawyers for the poor sued state welfare officials
Thursday, calling their decision to deny food stamps to able-bodied
immigrants unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, challenges a year-old state program that provides food
stamps only to legal immigrants who are at least 60, disabled or
younger than 18. The program was created last year to help legal
immigrants who were denied federally financed food stamps under the
new federal welfare law.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers charged Thursday that state officials violated
equal protection laws under the federal and state constitutions
when they denied food stamps to more than 31,000 impoverished,
able-bodied immigrants 18 to 59. Those laws, the lawyers said, do
not allow state officials to choose which poor people will receive
aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is supplying food stamps for some, but not
all needy people, which is illegal,'' said Marc Cohan , director of
litigation at the Welfare Law Center, a welfare advocacy group,
which filed the lawsuit, acting with the Legal Aid Society.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen states created food stamp programs for poor legal
immigrants who are not naturalized citizens in response to the
federal welfare law of 1996. Some states, like New York, restricted
participation. But welfare experts say most advocates have
supported those programs. And the New York lawsuit appears to be
the first in the nation to challenge a state food stamp program for
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many states, it's been a major struggle to get a state to
start a program at all,'' said David Super, the general counsel at
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research
and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most advocates have focused more on appealing to the
conscience of the state to create a program or expand one,'' said
Super, who specializes in food stamp and immigrant issues. ``I'm
not aware of any that have talked about litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hogan, executive deputy commissioner for the state Office of
Temporary and Disability Assistance, said advocates should be
congratulating Gov. George Pataki, not suing him, for providing
food stamps to the state's most vulnerable immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York state did step up to the plate to make sure people
who were here legally were, in fact, covered,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   The food stamp lawsuit was one of two filed on behalf of the
poor by the New York City advocacy groups Thursday. The groups also
filed a federal lawsuit contending that city officials improperly
denied medical insurance to welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The food stamp lawsuit marks the second attempt by advocates for
the poor to restore benefits to legal immigrants who lost them
under the federal welfare law, which sharply restricts assistance
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, advocates lost a similar suit against the federal
government when a judge ruled that federal officials, who control
immigration, had the right to deny benefits like food stamps to
legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But some legal experts say the new lawsuit is more likely to
succeed because federal officials have allowed states to choose
whether to create local food stamp programs.

A.W. OLSEN JR., HOTCHKISS SCHOOL HEADMASTER, 77 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.H., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. William Olsen Jr., whose more than two decades as headmaster
of the Hotchkiss School brought coeducation and robust expansion to
that preparatory boarding school in Lakeville, Conn., died July 30
at his home in Lakeville. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, the school reported.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen was the sixth headmaster of Hotchkiss, from 1960 to 1981.
The school, on 520 acres in the woodsy, rolling Berkshire hills ,
was endowed in 1891 by Maria Hotchkiss to provide a solid, classic
foundation for young men destined for Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, a firm believer in coeducation, introduced it at
Hotchkiss in 1974 and opened the door for a student body that is
now roughly half boys and half girls. Graduates today head for
colleges all over the country, although the Ivy League continues to
be the destination of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's reputation led to associations with many other
institutions in Connecticut. He was a trustee of the Wooster
School, in Danbury; the Westover School, in Middlebury; the Town
Hill School, in Salisbury, and the Forman School, in Litchfield,
among others, and was a past president of the Connecticut
Association of Independent Schools.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Hotchkiss, he worked for a number of years at the
executive recruiting firm Russell Reynolds Associates in Manhattan.
He became a managing director and pioneered the company's searches
for nonprofit executives.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Tianjin, China, where his father, Albert Olsen,
ran an import-export business. He graduated in 1939 from Hotchkiss
and in 1943 from Yale, where he managed the football team and sang
with the Whiffenpoofs. He also earned a master's degree in history
at Columbia University in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He began to teach at Hotchkiss in 1945, spent five years at the
Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and returned to Hotchkiss in
1953 to teach English and work in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jean Rohrbach Olsen; a daughter,
Liza Waters of Andover, Mass.; his twin, Elizabeth Horne; and
another sister, Sally Davis, both of New London, N.H.; and three
grandchildren.
