CRIME DOWN IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes New Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Crime in Los Angeles and cross the San Fernando
Valley slipped to 1970s levels through Dec. 19, but still at least
one person is killed on an average day, according to LAPD figures.
</P>
<P>
   They include Jose Jimenez, a 26-year-old mechanic who was killed
with several shots to the head in suburban North Hollywood over the
Christmas holiday. And they include the horrific murder of Galdino
Venegas, a 38-year-old cook whose throat was slashed during a
takeover robbery at a restaurant in San Pedro, 25 miles south of
downtown L.A., on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   These brutal slayings feed many people's belief that crime in
Los Angeles remains high, even as the numbers tell a vastly
different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that it's out of control, when in fact
crime is down at least 50 percent from five years ago,'' said Los
Angeles police spokesman Lt. Anthony Alba of the figures released
Monday. ``We have to do a better job of selling the decrease in
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kleiman, a University of California, Los Angeles professor
who specializes in crime control, blames this distorted perception
on how TV news handles crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of homicides are falling. But the number of news
reports of homicides has actually been soaring,'' Kleiman said.
``People are terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the drop in violent crime overall is significant in Los
Angeles and the neighboring cities of Burbank and Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Across Los Angeles, there were 410 homicides as of Dec. 26, as
compared to 566 last year, according to the LAPD's Crime Analysis
Section. In the early 1990s, the city logged about 1,300 murders
annually _ or some 3.5 a day on average.
</P>
<P>
   Crime fell 12.6 percent citywide and 10.8 percent in the San
Fernando Valley, from Jan. 1 through Dec. 19 this year, as compared
to year-end figures in 1997, according to the LAPD's computerized
crime analysis system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're apparently in the 1973 era of crime numbers,'' said
Detective Woodrow Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists and police attribute the decline to a vibrant
economy; stricter sentencing laws, including ``three-strikes'';
good police work; and fewer young men, the group traditionally
responsible for most crime.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti warns that prosecutors and police
must not be lured into complacency because the population of young
men will bounce back by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on truants and first-time offenders ... and
programs to work with schools to identify the chronic truant and
work with the child and parent,'' Garcetti said, adding that 78
percent of all convicted criminals are school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffer sentencing laws send a strong message to would-be
criminals that they will pay for even being connected to a crime,
he said. They include a new law for 1998 that Garcetti's office
sponsored, which toughens sentencing for people who are found to be
present during a crime involving a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will deter crime,'' Garcetti predicted. ``The gang members
are talking about this because they are all facing life
sentencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alba agreed that the police must redouble their efforts to
address the roots of crime, not just the people who commit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is every bit as important as arresting offenders,''
he said, adding that the department's goals include establishing
programs for youngsters, including parenting classes, reading
programs and Explorer Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of rapes, which ominously spiked in Valley during the
first half of the year, have fallen off since then, with the West
Valley Division reporting the largest decline, 31 percent, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of robberies were also significantly down citywide and
in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Valleywide, homicides were down by about 11 percent, with Van
Nuys logging the most substantial decline: nine slayings this year
vs. 14 last year _ or 36 percent below last year. However, Valley
officials warn the statistics do not reflect the last two weeks of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The only LAPD Valley division reporting an increase was
Devonshire, where 14 people were killed as of Dec. 19, compared to
11 for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Devonshire's figure could be attributed, at least in
part, to an increase in gang crime there.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a nationwide trend, the crime tally in cities around
Los Angeles also were poised to hit levels not seen since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, north of downtown L.A., the number of slayings fell
by 60 percent, with two between Jan. 1 and November, compared to
five during the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall violent crime in Glendale was down 20.2 percent.
Theft-larceny was the only category that increased, by 3.1 percent
_ mainly stemming from break-ins of locked vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Burbank reported four killings from Jan. 1 through
November, compared to zero murders in 1997. But the 25-year average
has been five murders per year, said Burbank police Lt. Larry Koch.
Overall violent crime in Burbank was down 15 percent, with 581
fewer crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of the 581 represents an individual victim who didn't
have to be victimized,'' Koch said.

HATE CRIMES DRAW ATTENTION OF L.A. AUTHORITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new LAPD policy targets hate crimes by
increasing accountability and joining with community groups to
prevent prejudice from erupting into crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes supervisors responsible for follow-up; it centralizes
the reporting within the LAPD,'' said Detective Tom King,
Supervisor of the Criminal Conspiracy Section. ``It also formally
encourages the divisions to work very closely with local community
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which took effect this month, is the result of
collaboration between police and a task force of community groups,
the City Attorney, District Attorney and U.S. Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis was really that LAPD doesn't work in a vacuum,''
said Tamar Galatzan, an attorney for the Anti-Defamation League who
served on the task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized that the only way to successfully fight hate
crime was to work closely with community groups for prevention, and
to work with other law enforcement _ FBI, ATF _ to keep everyone in
the loop to make sure that if there's a prosecution, it's the
strongest one possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes are criminal acts against victims because of their
actual or perceived race, nationality, religion, gender, disability
or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hate crimes citywide rose from 438 in 1994 to a
peak of 571 in 1996, police statistics report. The number is
projected to reach 516 this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of victims are targeted because of their
race, those crimes have tapered off slightly, while hate crimes
based on religion or sexual orientation are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to combat hate crimes have been complicated by a
confusing array of rules, scattered in numerous documents _
including a manual for a police office that no longer exists _ King
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy precisely defines responsibility at each level of
command and sets time lines for rapid action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, an officer responding to a hate offense
notifies both the watch commander, who orders an immediate
investigation, and the detective headquarters, which reports the
incident to the chief.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the detective captain in each area must assign one
detective to coordinate all hate crime investigations and compile a
monthly summary of hate offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly reports should improve the hate crimes
record-keeping system, which showed a clerical error rate of 50
percent and required elaborate cross-checking to ensure accuracy,
King said.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the success of the new measures, the department is
introducing intensive training sessions on handling hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also defines a category of ``hate incidents'' _
noncriminal acts motivated by hate or prejudice against a certain
group of people. This includes epithets, distribution of hate
literature or posting of hate material, even on one's own property.
</P>
<P>
   While this requires police to track noncriminal activity, the
department said the practice is legal and provides hints to future
criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA Constitutional law professor Eugene Volokh agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes perfect sense for the police to follow up on what
someone is saying legally, and see if he acts on it illegally,''
Volokh said. ``But as a matter of prudence, and public control over
the police, it might make sense for people to monitor what the
police are doing with this.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that by reporting noncriminal hate incidents, police
can alert community groups when tensions rise and help devise ways
to diffuse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good about the policy is that it calls for
accountability and responsibility within the LAPD at a very high
level,'' said Carla Arranaga, the Deputy District Attorney in
charge of hate crimes suppression. ``And it calls for developing a
response to hate crimes that goes a long way beyond prosecution,
and goes a long way toward hate crime prevention.''

BRUINS LOOK BACK AT '94 ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shawn Stuart, who was a UCLA recruit on Jan. 1,
1994, remembers a Wisconsin fan offering $750 for his $75 ticket.
Bruins assistant Bob Field remembers raucous Badgers fans tossing
footballs up, up, up _ and out of the Rose Bowl during warmups.
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez remembers walking into the stadium
and thinking he had a home-field advantage 2,000 miles from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Every memory is different, yet they inevitably return to the
same lasting image _ of the Rose Bowl awash in Wisconsin red, with
UCLA feeling very much the visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't Camp Randall painted up beautifully today?'' Alvarez
asked, referring to Wisconsin's home stadium in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   There are other images from the '94 Rose Bowl: more Wisconsin
fans than tickets available; the Badgers pounding UCLA with
physical, prototypical Big Ten football; the Bruins committing six
turnovers; and, of course, UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook scrambling
futilely as the clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin didn't play great, we just turned the ball over,''
said Stuart, who was days away from enrolling at UCLA when the
Badgers defeated the Bruins 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   No players in uniform that day will play in the 1999 Rose Bowl,
but the '94 game is relevant this week. Specifically, Wisconsin
will use its punishing running game and massive offensive line to
test UCLA's defensive mettle. Five years ago, the Badgers rushed
for 250 yards. Will they do the same Friday?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA tight end Bryan Fletcher, whose brother, Terrell, was a
Wisconsin tailback in '94, believes the Badgers will try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell said Pac-10 teams were finesse and Big Ten teams were
smash-mouth,'' Fletcher said. ``He didn't believe UCLA could hang
with a smash-mouth team. I expect them to do the same thing this
year. It'll be physical, physical, physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin devoured its ticket allotment this month, just as it
did in '94. Back then, Badgers fans were celebrating their first
Rose Bowl in 31 years and purchased approximately 70,000 tickets _
30,000 more than UCLA. Many who believed they had tickets were left
without, and in the parking lot $46 seats went for at least 10
times face value.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium was red from first row to last and all around. When
the Bruins charged out of the tunnel and onto their home field,
they were the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it,'' said UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, a high
school junior at the time. ``It was pathetic. A lot of people they
sold tickets to were not really behind UCLA. Guys were shocked. If
that happens again, I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins clinched the '94 Rose Bowl on Marvin Goodwin's
dramatic interception against USC. But from that moment and through
the game itself, little went right. There was no fan support, no
interest on campus. Quarterback Wayne Cook missed three game-week
practices because of the flu and recuperated at his parents' home
in Newbury Park.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA led the nation with a plus-19 turnover margin during the
'93 season, but the Bruins had six against the Badgers. The
mistakes, combined with Wisconsin tailback Brent Moss (158 yards
rushing), proved too much for UCLA. Wisconsin jumped to a 7-3 lead
in the first quarter on Moss' 3-yard run and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very physical, very similar to what they do now,''
Field said. ``They had big backs _ not as big as (current tailback
Ron) Dayne _ and they moved the ball on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, they'll want to play smash-mouth again. If that's a
trademark of Barry Alvarez teams, then they both have that stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez dismissed comparisons between his Rose Bowl teams. The
'94 version had a solid quarterback (Darrell Bevell) and
respectable passing attack. This year _ with Dayne, a massive
offensive line and mediocre quarterback Mike Samuel _ the Badgers
are the unbalanced antithesis of UCLA's dynamic attack.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin passed for 204 yards per game in 1994, just 110 this
season. There is no secret to the Badgers' attack this year. They
will run, then run some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a totally different team,'' Alvarez said. ``We were a
more balanced attack back then. We felt we could throw the ball
around (in '94). I don't know how this game will go. The two teams
are at the opposite end of the spectrum. I mean, totally opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to get crazy with the ball. We'll be somewhat
conservative. We play best when we're in a heavyweight fight going
toe-to-toe. I don't know if they're going to let us play like
that.''

CAMBODIAN LEADER RESISTS PUNISHING TOP KHMER ROUGE OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs dateline; subs story for updating, rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TA KAMAO, Cambodia _ Defying international pressure to put top
leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen said on
Monday that they should be welcomed ``with bouquets of flowers, not
with prisons and handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The two latest Khmer Rouge holdouts _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea _ arrived in a helicopter from western Cambodia on Tuesday and
had lunch with Hun Sen at his heavily guarded compound on the
outskirts of the capital, Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   They were accompanied by their families and Ieng Sary, the
former Khmer Rouge foreign minister who was the first major figure
to switch allegiance in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who defected on Saturday, were at the very top of
the Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 1975 to 1979, when the group ruled
the country, and more than a million people were executed or died
of starvation, disease and overwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead to the
21st century with a clean slate,'' Hun Sen told reporters outside a
meeting of his Cabinet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are among the last of the movement's leaders to give
up the struggle, and Hun Sen did not rule out a future Khmer Rouge
trial, saying it was an issue for the judiciary _ which he controls
_ rather than the executive branch to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge commander, broke with the
movement in the 1970s. Historians have said there is little
evidence that he was directly involved in the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leave only one
major figure at large, Ta Mok, known as the Butcher, who seems to
be as unpopular among his comrades as he is among his enemies. Hun
Sen said on Monday that he would extend no welcome to Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
   The main Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. If the last
two defectors, along with earlier ones like Ieng Sary, are not
brought to trial, Ta Mok _ if he is captured _ could be the sole
Khmer Rouge figure to be held accountable for the deaths and misery
the movement caused.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's message in his remarks on Monday was different than in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997 he signed a letter requesting help from the United
Nations in preparing for a trial for Khmer Rouge leaders on charges
of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this weekend, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N.
official who monitors human rights in Cambodia, said Hun Sen had
repeatedly assured him that he planned to proceed with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I agree completely that there must be justice,'''
Hammarberg said. ```I promise you that no one will be spared.' He
told me this several times.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggle against political opponents, it is only
in the last two months that Hun Sen has achieved full control of
Cambodia's government. His new stance seemed to reflect a desire to
avoid a situation that could get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his words echoed a feeling among many Cambodians
who are exhausted from decades of conflict and prefer not to stir
up the demons of their past. ``If a wound does not hurt, you should
not poke at it with a stick to make it bleed,'' Hun Sen said. ``If
we put these two men in prison, will this benefit society or lead
to civil war?''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment clashes with a contrary feeling among many
foreigners _ and many Cambodians as well _ that a wound cannot heal
until it is treated, even if the cure is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers say a ``culture of impunity,'' with its
roots in the unresolved cases of Khmer Rouge leaders, is to blame
for much of the country's lawlessness and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in
Washington that after a trial, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea could be
pardoned in the interest of national reconciliation if that is what
Cambodians choose. ``But to allow these men to return to society as
if one of the worst massacres of the 20th century never took place
_ that's unthinkable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, experts are preparing an outline of
charges and legal procedures that could be used if a tribunal is
created. One possibility would be to create a special court in a
third country, like those trying people charged with committing
genocide and other crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
Another would be for Cambodia to set up its own special court with
international help.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen brushed aside all outside advice. ``In Cambodia we know
how to heal ourselves using our own medicines,'' he said. ``If we
try mixing in foreign medicine it will not cure Cambodian
diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The interests of the nation and the people do not
require a trial or conflicts among ourselves, but national
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here, which are generally obedient to Hun Sen,
largely support this stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia should discard sentiments of vengeance,'' said Rasmei
Angkor, a Cambodian-language daily. ``Even if we killed Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea the lives of those who died would not be
returned to us. The best thing now is for all Cambodians to come
together and love each other so we can find real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party led by Sam Rainsy expressed a contrary
view. ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' a party statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Noun Chea, 71, who was ``Brother No. 2'' under the Khmer
Rouge leader, Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official
head of state, joined a community of defectors in the remote town
of Pailin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both had spent most of their lives as revolutionaries, alongside
Pol Pot. Khieu Samphan, the public face of the movement, returned
to Phnom Penh once before, in 1991, and was attacked by a mob
organized by Hun Sen's government. Nuon Chea was the man whose idea
of creating a primitive agrarian society led to the forced
evacuation of the cities and the massacres of the country's
educated classes.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of former Khmer Rouge leaders are now nominally
within government control in Pailin and elsewhere and are available
for capture and trial, after more than two years of defections.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen said the two latest defectors should be greeted with
an embrace for giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not come tomorrow with the political and military
agenda of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``They will come as simple
citizens, bringing their wives and children and grandchildren.
There's nothing for anyone to worry about.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ The movie Weekend at Bernie's comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of some wild kids taking advantage of a free
trip to paradise, fumbling around all over the place and ultimately
getting caught in the middle of something ugly.
</P>
<P>
   They try desperately to prop up the lifeless body of their boss,
who was suddenly and brutally snuffed out in his prime by
gangsters. They slap some sunglasses on him, mold a silly grin on
his face and cart him around town hoping no one will notice.
</P>
<P>
   These Kansas State Wildcats, their coach, Bill Snyder, and their
rabidly supportive fans with obviously short memories have come to
San Antonio like dead ringers, so to speak, for Bernie.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Cats have been brutally snuffed this bowl season, no doubt
about it. They probably deserve better than the Builders Square
Alamo Bowl. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   They should have a bigger stage and a better opponent than 8-4
Purdue. They should be New Year's Day and prime time, not Tuesday
night and a mid-level bowl on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country realizes this. The Wildcats emphatically
have reminded us, and reminded us, and reminded us again ever since
Texas A&AMP;M pulled the rug out from under them in the Big 12
Championship Game and the Bowl Championship Series whacked them
when bowl bids were announced Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the 'Cats don't seem to know paradise or the opportunity to
still stake claim to the national championship when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   They have arrived by the thousands _ up to 30,000 purple-clad
supporters, by some estimates _ to a beautiful city, with a
beautiful history, restaurants and parties galore and weather
dialed up by the chamber of commerce _ sunny, 70-degree days and
cool, margarita-sipping nights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 'Cats still consider it all a chamber of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   They drove for hours, as Wildcats fans are wont to do, and
rolled into town with chips on their shoulders and shoe polish at
the ready. Messages such as, ``Bring back the Big Eight'' and
``Forget the Alamo'' have been scribbled everywhere. A popular
T-shirt seen around town shows a bold, purple ``X'' transposed over
the letters ``BCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the River Walk on Monday night, a chant of ``We want
Tennessee'' went up, while throughout the week leading to tonight's
kickoff, players and coaches have tried futilely to do and say the
right things.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been as transparent as that smile on Bernie's face.
It's all been so lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious reason why the Wildcats should get over it is, well,
they didn't beat the Aggies. The secondary couldn't stop Branndon
Stewart. The offense couldn't protect a lead or hold on to the ball
in the waning moments. The greatest linebacking corps the 'Cats
have ever had couldn't tackle Sirr Parker on third-and-long.
</P>
<P>
   K-State offensive coordinator Ron Hudson said this week, ``To
lose to A&AMP;M when we were a better football team that was hard to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the Wildcats had to do was prove they were better. They
didn't. And this is where the admittedly screwy bowl system dropped
them.
</P>
<P>
   All the 'Cats must do now is take the Alamo Bowl and turn it
into the stage they still think they deserve. Beat Purdue with
authority. Hold on to the ball and the lead. Send a message that is
more important and lasting than shoe polish on the hotel window and
letters on a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's something about brutally cold, bowl-less and
windswept days in Manhattan, Kan., that the rest of us don't know
about, the once-dismal Wildcats more than any other program should
know there are worse places to be than San Antonio on a 70-degree
December day. The Wildcats should know there are worse situations
to be in than 11-1 and No. 4 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   They should know the national championship still is out there
and still a real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Win, Kansas State. Win big, and hope Ohio State and Tennessee
both lose, neither of which is out of the realm of possibility. And
leave it up to the Associated Press pollsters, who would be free to
vote Florida State or Kansas State No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo Bowl is not a booby prize but an opportunity. The
Wildcats blew their last great opportunity, the one about which
they all still seem inconsolably bitter. Their coach compared the
A&AMP;M loss to deaths in the family and the horrible automobile crash
that injured his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   What should bother people today is not what happened earlier
this month but how the Wildcats have reacted. From the head coach,
to the Heisman runner-up quarterback, to the thousands of fans
grumbling as they walk along the River Walk, it has become clear
the Wildcats feel something was taken away from them and it's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a school like this come that close, I don't think it
will happen again,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not gone. Purdue is not Tennessee. San Antonio is not
Tempe. But a little help from Texas A&AMP;M and Florida State and a lot
of what got K-State through its first 11 games still might replace
those transparent smiles on so many faces with the real thing.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Nothing can get the orange blood of University of Texas
fans boiling faster than these two words: Jackie Sherrill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein probably wouldn't rate as high on the list of
evil villains for UT fans as Sherrill, the former Texas A&AMP;M coach
who will lead Mississippi State against the Longhorns on Friday in
the Cotton Bowl. Hate may be too kind a word to describe the scorn
Longhorns have for Sherrill, who has coached his teams to seven
consecutive victories over UT.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sherrill won't admit it publicly, people close to him
will tell you the feeling is mutual. Lynn Amedee, the Mississippi
State offensive coordinator who coached under Sherrill for three
years at A&AMP;M before spending three seasons at Texas, knows the real
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is a big-time deal for Jackie,'' Amedee said.
``Being on that other sideline against them for so long, you just
have a natural rivalry. He has been successful against Texas, and
he wants to keep it that way. That's the purpose he has, and he's
serious about it. He reminds us that this is a big ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill's last game against the Longhorns (1992) prompted an
incident that will live in college football infamy. Sherrill had a
bull castrated at Mississippi State's practice to fire up his
players for the game, which the Bulldogs won 28-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bevo (the Longhorn mascot) is still upset about what
happened to one of his buddies,'' Texas coach Mack Brown kidded.
``We've gotten him some counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown may be able to joke about it, but that act crystallized
Longhorns fans' loathing of Sherrill and demonstrated his hostile
feelings about Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get hung up in that,'' Sherrill said. ``I'm
sure for a lot of Texas fans who are caught up in their love for
that school, I'm not a very good word in their minds. But that's
part of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas defensive end Aaron Humphrey said the players are well
aware of how their fans feel about Sherrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, we know about it,'' Humphrey said. ``One of the
first things brought up to us was the games Jackie coached at A&AMP;M.
Nobody around Texas likes him a whole lot, to be blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know about him castrating the bull the last time they
played us. That gets us fired up a little bit. He kind of never
mind. I won't even start on that. He's a good coach, but yeah, we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill insists he isn't obsessed with beating Texas but admits
he will have some special feelings when he returns to the stadium
where he led the Aggies to three consecutive Cotton Bowl
appearances from 1986-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think it will affect me that much,'' Sherrill
said. ``It probably will hit me when I go down that ramp. I'm not
real excitable until kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Amedee believes Sherrill may be the most misunderstood man in
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``People for some reason don't like him,'' Amedee said of
Sherrill. ``Over the years, there have been problems between Jackie
and the media. But when you work for him, shoot, I would do
anything for him. He's a boss you can sit down and talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill left A&AMP;M after the 1988 season amid scandal and NCAA
violations involving boosters, which led to probation for the
school. But Sherrill never was implicated in the violations. He
spent two years out of coaching, including a stint as a part-owner
of a Ford dealership in Baytown.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill said he had other offers before deciding to take the
job at Mississippi State before the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to high school in Biloxi, so I grew up knowing about
Mississippi State,'' Sherrill said. ``They had some good teams, but
they never had been able to win consistently. I think it was very
similar to the way A&AMP;M was when I took over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill has led the Bulldogs to a 49-42-2 record, including
four bowl appearances in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a coach's coach,'' Amedee said. ``You have to be
tough-skinned, because he is going to let you know how he feels,
but he's fair, and that's all you can expect from a coach. I think
a lot of the other stuff is people just not knowing the guy, and
he's hard to know sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill is seen as aloof and unemotional, but there is another
side he rarely reveals. Earlier this week, Sherrill was moved to
tears when asked about his most memorable Cotton Bowl moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill told a story about how his close friend Bob Bernath
died after watching the Aggies win the 1986 Cotton Bowl 36-16 over
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good friend of coach (Bear) Bryant,'' Sherrill said.
``When I went to A&AMP;M, coach Bryant called him and said, `You take
care of Jackie.' So we became very close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were over there on Christmas Eve having dinner, and he was
upstairs in bed. It was clear he wasn't going to live much longer.
We had to call an ambulance to take him to the hospital. So I went
to see him before I came up here (to Dallas) on Christmas Day. He
said he was going to stay alive to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was joking with him and said, `What do you want the score to
be?' He said, `I want you to beat them by 20 points.' We got our
Cotton Bowl watches early, and I gave him mine. He watched the
game, and then he passed away, but we beat them by 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill had to pause several times during the story because he
was choked up and couldn't speak. It isn't something most people
would expect from Sherrill, but he is a man of many faces.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best way to understand Sherrill is to ask his players
about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real person, and he's not going to tell you something
that isn't true,'' said Bulldogs running back James Johnson. ``
He's a straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Wayne Madkin said Sherrill is a teacher, not a
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't do all this yapping and hollering,'' Madkin said.
``But he has a unique way of getting you ready to play. He is a
calm, quiet voice telling you what you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill's typical sideline attire is a long-sleeve white shirt,
a dark tie and a clipboard _ a no-nonsense look for a no-nonsense
approach to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always relished playing coaches that jump on the table
and holler and scream and all those things,'' Sherrill said. ``As
soon as you get out there on the field and the player across from
you slaps you in the face, you realize this is the deal, not that
dumb coach yelling on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody spends too much time giving accolades to the coach.
Coaches can lose games, but I've never seen a coach win a game, no
matter what the fans think.''

BADGERS HAVE SPECIAL EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The participants have called it a matchup of
UCLA's potent offense against Wisconsin's stingy defense, and
Wisconsin's powerful running game against UCLA's young, wobbly
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are, special teams will have a voice in the Rose
Bowl, and that appears to favor the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   Because bowl teams are permitted only 15 postseason practices _
they spend much of that time regaining lost rhythm and cramming for
opposing attacks _ special teams are often lost in the frenzy. When
kickoff arrives, anything can happen, and has.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to our team, I'm going to remind them of West
Virginia-Missouri (in the Insight.com Bowl),'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``There was a field goal blocked, a long kickoff
return and a blocked punt. The kicking game showed up huge in that
game. And Colorado had a kickoff return for a touchdown against
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicking game is so vital, and the participants in bowl
games only have so many hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin may have the best special teams UCLA has faced this
season. Kicker Matt Davenport made 18 of 20 field goals, while
Kevin Stemke averaged 44 yards per punt. Both players were named
first-team All-Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers have blocked four kicks and returned three punts for
touchdowns. Nick Davis averaged 15.7 yards per return, also tops in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   With punter/kicker Chris Sailer and punt returner Ryan Roques,
UCLA's special teams are as solid as they've been in years. But can
they match Wisconsin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can win that area, but we can't lose it,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Big anniversary: Jan. 1, 1994 is a significant date in UCLA
history, and it has nothing to do with the Bruins' 21-16 loss to
Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That day, over a thousand miles away, Texas A&AMP;M lost to Notre
Dame 24-21 in the Cotton Bowl. In the aftermath, Aggies coach R.C.
Slocum fired his offensive coordinator, Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew it was going to happen,'' said Toledo, who
eventually took the same post at UCLA and, on Jan. 4, 1996, became
the Bruins' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the beef: The undisputed champion of Sunday's visit to
Lawry's Beef Bowl was offensive tackle Kris Farris, who said he ate
six slabs of 14- 16-ounce prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   Farris doubled the intake of offensive guard Andy Meyers, long
considered the Bruins' best eater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel OK, but I fell asleep at 7:30,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   QB comparison: Wisconsin senior quarterback Mike Samuel had a
modest passing efficiency rating of 115.2 and averaged just 93
yards passing per game. But he has impressed Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like (Cade) McNown. He's a fierce competitor and he's a
winner,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Toledo's comment, Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both play the same position, they both take the snap from
center and they both won 10 games,'' Alvarez said. ``I don't see
much else similar. (Toledo) was being nice.''

STARS PUSH UNBEATEN STREAK TO 12
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two months ago, the Nashville Predators would have been
just the type of team to give the Stars all sorts of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A tight-checking bunch with just enough shooters to be
dangerous, the NHL's latest expansion team came into last night's
game with the momentum of recent upsets over the Detroit Red Wings
and Washington Capitals in their back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Predators played a suffocating style that caused
the Stars some grief, it wasn't enough to stop the NHL's hottest
team. The Stars survived a strategic battle to take a 1-0 victory
against the Predators and tie a franchise record for consecutive
games without a loss at 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just on a roll right now and we want to keep it on a
roll,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We're not trying to do
anything fancy, we're just trying to win each game.'
</P>
<P>
   In the process of doing that, the Stars are also rolling up a
long list of accolades. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Tying the franchise record unbeaten streak at 12 games (9-0-3).
The 1981-82 Minnesota North Stars also went 9-0-3 in one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the franchise record for wins in a month at 10. The old
record was set several times at nine. The Stars have two games
remaining in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinching the Western Conference's best record by Dec. 29, the
cutoff date to name coaches for the All-Star Game. That means Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock will be head coach of an All-Star team for the
third consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Giving goalie Ed Belfour his third shutout of the season and
43rd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at the game might find it hard to believe that so much was
riding on a game that was, in many ways, a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could call it boring,'' Sydor said in an
apologetic manner.
</P>
<P>
   While both teams generated their share of scoring opportunities,
both teams also didn't mind playing safe, defensive hockey. The
Stars got off 21 shots on net and had another 22 that missed the
mark. Their league-best power play moved the puck around the ice
but finished 0-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we moved the puck well on the power play, I didn't
think we got many good chances,'' Hitchcock said. ``All of our
shots were from the perimeter; we didn't get to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Predators goalie Eric Fichaud had a strong night and the entire
Nashville lineup did a great job of playing without captain Tom
Fitzgerald (death in the family), leading goal-scorer Sergei
Krivokrasov (leg injury) and top goalie Mike Dunham (groin strain).
But the Predators finished with 14 shots on goal because they
couldn't penetrate a tired but determined Stars defense that once
again was led by Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve a lot of credit for this many games in that
\Rtime\S span and still being able to play a strong defensive
hockey game,'' Hitchcock said of the Stars playing six games in six
different cities in 11 days, including squeezing the Christmas
travel rush into the time span. ``It was a good effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars showed their fatigue early as they had 11 shots miss
the net in the first period. It was a ``telltale sign,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Stars didn't get frustrated, stayed with the
defensive game plan and finally broke through an opening at the
12:31 mark of the second period. Grant Marshall fished a puck out
of the defensive zone and pushed it ahead to defenseman Shawn
Chambers, who was working through the neutral zone. Chambers then
sent a pass to Guy Carbonneau on the right wing and headed to the
net. Carbonneau made a slick pass back to Chambers on the
give-and-go, and Chambers redirected a shot over Fichaud for the
only goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chambers' second goal of the season, matching his total
for all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them now I don't have to score any more for the rest of
the year,'' Chambers joked after the game.
</P>
<P>
   But while there was some humor in the win, Hitchcock said plays
like that have helped the team stay on their 12-game roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference in our team from the start of the
season to now is that even with our energy level down a quart, we
stayed with the program,'' Hitchcock said. ``A lot of little things
happened good for us tonight. Shawn Chambers scoring a goal, we
needed someone other than our key people scoring because they were
frustrated. Right now, we're acting and behaving like a good
team.''

CARDS REMEMBER END TO THEIR LAST GAME VS. COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When asked yesterday whether the controversial
ending to the last meeting between the Cowboys and Arizona
Cardinals would have any impact on Saturday's wild-card playoff
game, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will have an impact,'' Gailey said. ``I
kind of think that was at the beginning of November.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Arizona regarding the Cowboys' Nov. 15 victory and
the last play _ on which pass interference could have been called
against Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith as he broke up a pass to
Cardinals receiver Rob Moore _ is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough loss, and I still think about it,'' Cardinals
guard Chris Dishman said after Sunday's playoff-clinching victory
against the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman hung up his gloves from the Cowboys game in his locker
and vowed not to take them down until the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a day that goes by in the locker room that I don't
see those gloves. They are there for a reason, to remind me of a
loss that was the toughest I've ever had.''
SANDERS' EXAMINATION
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders had a magnetic resonance
imaging examination on his sprained left big toe yesterday and flew
to Palm Beach, Fla., where he was to be examined by specialist Dr.
Bill Hamilton last night.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys spokesman Brett Daniels said results of the examination
will be released today.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Hamilton finds, it's unlikely that Sanders will
available for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Sanders, who is listed as ``out'' on the Cowboys'
injury report, was doubtful for the game. Sanders was injured Nov.
15 against the Cardinals. He has missed the past six games.
OFFENSIVE HIGHLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   There was little not to like about the Cowboys' offensive effort
against the Washington Redskins on Sunday. The line protected
quarterback Troy Aikman. The wide receivers made big plays on the
outside, including a tempo-setting 51-yard reception by Michael
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   And running back Emmitt Smith had the cutting, twisting 26-yard
touchdown run that fullback Daryl Johnston called one of Smith's
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also got production from third-string tailback
Sherman Williams, who has become Smith's primary backup because of
an injury to Chris Warren. Williams rushed for a career-high 90
yards on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the difference between the Redskins game, which
featured two second-quarter touchdowns and 20 first-half points,
and the previous three when the Cowboys combined for just two
touchdowns, was execution in the passing game and the big plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hit on four passes longer than 24 yards against the
Redskins after connecting on just three big plays in the previous
three games combined.

   IRVING, Texas _ Six weeks after the flag that didn't fall
against Kevin Smith in the end zone, the Arizona Cardinals finally
get overtime with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac quarterback Jake Plummer, with seven fourth-quarter
comebacks this season, will attempt to upset the favored Cowboys,
who have enough history on their side to suggest that Saturday's
wild-card game probably won't be their last of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not lost a home playoff game since 1983. They
have won 16 of the past 17 against the Cardinals, including the
past three. They defeated Arizona, 38-6, in the Sept. 6 season
opener. They hung on for a 35-28 victory in Arizona when Smith
appeared to be hanging onto Rob Moore as he reached for Plummer's
pass in the end zone Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory this weekend, the Cowboys would become the eighth
NFL team in the Super Bowl era to defeat a division opponent three
times in a season. Five other teams who swept the season series in
the division lost to the same opponent in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, meanwhile, have not won in Dallas since 1989.
They were the ``St. Louis Cardinals'' when they last appeared in
the playoffs, in 1982. They were the ``Chicago Cardinals'' when
they last won a playoff game, 51 years ago yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year Cardinals coach Vince Tobin is playoff tested, having
been a defensive coordinator for four division champions. But he
certainly can't say the same for his team. He'll bring a
youth-laden club to Texas Stadium on Saturday that features only 10
players with playoff experience _ 39 games, all for other teams.
That is five less than the Cowboys' trio of Troy Aikman, Michael
Irvin, and Emmitt Smith, who have combined to play in 44 postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably matters quite a bit from Monday through
Friday,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said yesterday. ``Then, after
the kickoff, I don't know. Dallas was not in the playoffs at one
point, then they got in their first playoff game and beat somebody
they were not supposed to beat and went on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who has been an offensive assistant on four AFC
champions, says history should not matter much Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``New playoff teams and perennial playoff teams start somewhere
every year,'' he said. ``Normally, the team that goes out and plays
the best and executes is the team that wins. It helps to have
experience. But I don't think that is the winning edge. The winning
edge is execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys failed to execute on defense in the second half of
their previous game against the Cardinals. With Deion Sanders
sidelined after suffering a first-half toe injury, the Cowboys'
secondary allowed Plummer to complete 18 of 33 passes for 314 yards
and two touchdowns in the second half. The Cardinals, who were down
28-0, came within 5 yards and a controversial no-call on Smith of
mounting the biggest regular-season comeback in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is listed as out for the game Saturday. But Gailey
considers his secondary much-improved from that meltdown in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about our secondary now than I did then,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his team will not do anything remarkably different in
preparation for the Cardinals this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go about it with the same attention to detail, the same
tempo in practice,'' Gailey said. ``There have been a lot of
must-win games. We've finally reached one. This is a must-win game.
We've got to win this to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys keep going, the road to their record ninth Super
Bowl becomes considerably more difficult. They'd have to go through
Atlanta and perhaps Minnesota to get to Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami
on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   No NFC team has made it to a Super Bowl by winning two road
playoff games since the 1975 Cowboys, who won in Minnesota and in
Los Angeles to make it to Super Bowl X.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you are doing in the regular season is putting yourself in
position to go play in the postseason,'' Gailey said. ``The
postseason is what this league is all about.''

MANY QUESTIONS ON THE NFL PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of the 1999 Super Bowl tournament hinges on the
performance of Joe Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the marquee names poised to help the NFL
postseason entrants survive the monthlong battle of attrition that
begins this weekend with the wild-card games, the name of Joe
Abdullah hangs above them all.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 teams. There are 11 games. There is one trophy.
And, on the eve of the playoffs, there are 10 questions, beginning
with:
</P>
<P>
   1) Who is Joe Abdullah?
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the Denver Broncos employed a practice-squad running
back named Joe Abdullah. In Week 1 of this season, Broncos rushing
sensation Terrell Davis _ with 2,008 yards the likely league MVP
and the singular key to who does what in these NFL playoffs _ was
dressing in the Mile High Stadium locker room when his name tag
fell from above his stall, revealing an old name tag underneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then, I always put it up there, `Joe Abdullah'
instead of `Terrell Davis,' '' Davis' teammate Howard Griffith
said. ``It's something we always tease him about.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos opponents wish they were planning to stop Joe Abdullah.
If they can't stop Davis, hang another Super Bowl MVP above his
stall.
</P>
<P>
   2) Are the Cowboys elite? Or elitists?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to ruin it for me,'' coach Chan Gailey said
after the Cowboys clinched a playoff berth. ``No matter how hard
you try.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was talking to the cynical news media _ but maybe he
should've pointed his acidic comments at his veterans, who
sometimes act as if their pedigree puts them above having to scrap
through a first-round playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, you've got one foot in the grave, granted _ but
it's up to you whether you try to remove that foot or simply give
in and jump into the hole. If everybody gets into the trenches, the
Cowboys have a negotiable path to the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   3) Who's healthy enough to play quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Steve Young has a dinged-up knee. New England's
Drew Bledsoe has a broken finger on his throwing hand.
Jacksonville's Mark Brunell has a severely sprained ankle.
Minnesota's Randall Cunningham has a broken (nonthrowing) hand.
Conventional wisdom says that if they're limping, so will their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true here,'' Vikings coach Denny Green said. ``With
Randall and Brad \RJohnson, the starter before an injury opened the
job and MVP candidacy to Cunningham\S, we've got strength I don't
think anybody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only Minnesota and Denver (where Bubby Brister has been
stellar in occasional relief of John Elway) figure to survive in
the long term if the injury bug bites under center.
</P>
<P>
   4) Are the Atlanta Falcons for real?
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson is. Receivers Terance Mathis and
Tony Martin are. But where Atlanta boasts an unheralded edge on
most opponents is on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Archambeau? Travis Hall? Shane Dronett? Chuck Smith?
</P>
<P>
   You don't know them. Watch the playoffs. You will.
</P>
<P>
   5) Isn't playoff experience a major determining factor?
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says it's so, and it might be true for
coaches in charge of wet-behind-the-ears programs such as Dan
Reeves in Atlanta. But in truth, it's tough to envision youngsters
like Jake Plummer of the Cardinals, Randy Moss of the Vikings and
Fred Taylor of the Jaguars suddenly running scared.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're lining up against old-timers Cunningham (one
playoff win, lifetime), the Jets' Vinny Testaverde or Atlanta's
Chris Chandler (neither of whom have started a postseason game),
you can always hope for flashbacks to the days when they were
unsuccessful quarterbacks playing for unsuccessful teams.
</P>
<P>
   6) Are the Dynasty-That-Never-Was Packers finally out of gas?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Holmgren played with fire when he let his probable
lame-duck status be known to his world. It's tough to commit to him
when he's not committed to you, right?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Green Bay has a defense that ranks with
any in the NFC, has improving health from offensive weapons in wide
receiver Antonio Freeman and running back Dorsey Levens, has a
psychological edge on first-round foe San Francisco and has Brett
Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count us out,'' says Favre, who totaled a league-best
4,212 passing yards in a ``subpar'' season. ``We needed to get to
the playoffs. Now we've got a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But now, while Favre is the QB you might pay $50 to watch,
he's not the QB to bet $50 on.
</P>
<P>
   7) Who has the best chance to pull a first-round upset? Arizona
at Dallas is the popular pick, an interesting study because the
teams are so divergent in playoff experience. But depending on the
health of the quarterbacks, the No. 6 seed in the AFC, New England,
could make it tough on No. 3 seed Jacksonville. The Patriots with
Bledsoe have a chance; the Jaguars without Brunell do not _ and
even with Brunell, they might be reeling from giving up 50 points
in a Week 15 loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   8) Will Bill Parcells' pettiness be adversity or an advantage
for the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells built the moribund Giants into a champion in 1986,
rebuilt them into a champion in 1991, then built the moribund
Patriots into a Super Bowl appearance two years ago, and has built
the moribund Jets into a Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   He does it his way, and insists it's the right way. But with a
stingy defense, a serviceable running game and a quarterback who
makes enough plays to win, who can argue with Parcells?
</P>
<P>
   9) Besides New York, winners of a first-round bye, what's the
difference separating the other AFC East teams clogging the
postseason?
</P>
<P>
   Depends who you ask. In Miami, Jimmy Johnson's alleged magic
represents the difference. In Buffalo, Doug Flutie's alleged magic
represents the difference. In New England, when the Patriots are
healthy, there is a reliance on actual talent.
</P>
<P>
   10) How is a Denver-Minnesota Super Bowl not inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   Let's let 'em play, OK? Who died and made you The Amazing
Kreskin?

TEXAS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR TURNS UP HEAT ON DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When the going gets tough, the tough _ in this
case Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese _ turn on the oven.
</P>
<P>
   No, not to stick his head into it. The former Missouri fullback,
who specializes in coaching linebackers, bakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pies, cakes, cookies,'' Reese said. ``It's a nervous habit.
But it helps me relax when I get home late and can't sleep. And it
fattens me up a little bit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the pie's in the oven, Reese sometimes drifts into the
garage, picks up a wrench and works on the four-wheel-drive 1970
Toyota Land Cruiser he is restoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A '55 Chevy might be the next thing I look for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the task Reese faced this season in restoring
efficiency and confidence to the Longhorns' wounded defense, and
after many nights when it must have been hard to sleep, the wonder
is he doesn't outweigh Octavious Bishop _ Texas' 330-pound
offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defense has come about as far as any I've ever seen,''
Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``The job Carl and the defensive staff
has done getting these guys not to break and be so discouraged
because of the pressure they were under the year before, and
getting them to play so well and so hard, has been the difference
in our year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese characteristically shuns such credit. But he can go Brown
one better in measuring from there to here as the Longhorns brush
up on the defensive scheme they'll throw at Mississippi State on
Friday in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started last spring we were as bad as any group I've
ever started with,'' Reese said. ``And we've made more gains than
any group I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Formidable, however, is not a word one would use to describe the
Longhorns' defense. But the defense earned the respect of teams
such as Nebraska and Big 12 champion Texas A&AMP;M. And Mississippi
State running back James Johnson, who led the Southeastern
Conference in rushing, said he views the UT defenders with a wary
eye, even though Texas gave up an average of 30 points and 365
yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's going to be like facing another
SEC defense,'' Johnson said. ``And there ain't no bad defenses in
that league.''
</P>
<P>
   Point made.
</P>
<P>
   Reese has had similar success at places such as Vanderbilt and
Louisiana State. But his job at Texas was complicated because he
inherited players low on self-esteem after shouldering much of the
blame for a 4-7 record in 1997. And that feeling, once conquered to
a degree, rose again after a 1-2 start and consecutive lopsided
losses to UCLA (49-31) and Kansas State (48-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little like children who had been abused,'' Reese
said. ``It took a long time to get them out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior member of Brown's staff did it with the right amounts
of teaching, scheming, challenging, pats on the butt and trust,
players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a great guy,'' defensive end Aaron Humphrey said.
``Everyone has opened their arms to him. You sit back and listen
and do what he tells you, and you have the chance to make a lot of
plays. And I've never been around a coach who reads an offense like
he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dusty Renfro said he'll cherish the experience of
finishing a distinguished career working with Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great,'' Renfro said. ``I give him most of the credit for
what we've accomplished. He's kind of a laid-back country boy who
is more of a teacher than anything else. I hardly ever hear him
yell or scream. He's worked so well with us that we all respect him
and trust completely in what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story of this season has been our constant
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro did, however, have one critical thing to say about Reese:
``He's talked about it, but he's never brought us any of his
cookies.''

TCU OFFENSIVE LINE ADDED BASIL TO DIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ When TCU's season appeared to be finished way
back in November, tailback Basil Mitchell went to look at film for
a final time.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to remember individual yards that had led him to his
1,000-yard season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm looking at myself,'' Mitchell admitted with a
sly grin. ``In the background, though, I can see these guys jumping
up and down. It was the linemen. It was as if they were just as
excited as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs tackle Russ Sanders promises that to be true.
</P>
<P>
   He admits to bragging to friends and family that TCU's 239.1
yards-per-game rushing average ranked eighth nationally. He admits
to bragging on Mitchell's feat so often that a few friends think he
gained a few yards himself.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sanders and his fellow Frogs hogs did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brag about him,'' Frogs guard Greg Davis said. ``He had 166
attempts and 1,111 yards. That's probably 100 less attempts than
most 1,000-yard rushers. I'd like to think we had a hand in that.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione simply nodded. He realizes that
TCU's rushing prowess this season began with Sanders and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione had said coming in that he needed a big season from
his line. He needed a salty rushing game to build his team around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took establishing a good, strong running game as a personal
challenge,'' Frogs center Jeff Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges were plentiful early on.
</P>
<P>
   TCU struggled during spring practice, trying to blend a pair of
seniors in Davis and Sanders with a trio of underclassmen in
Garner, Michael Keathley and Jeff Millican.
</P>
<P>
   Size and strength were also problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought was, `Oh, I hope these guys are
overachievers,' '' Frogs offensive line coach Jim Bob Helduser
said, ``which they have proven to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Helduser asked them to get bigger and stronger and faster this
season, and Sanders and Co. willingly responded.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks, like getting bigger, have been tackled with
unparalleled zeal; training has continued deep into Sun Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with appetizers,'' Davis said, describing Sunday's
training regimen. ``Chips and salsa and, of course, queso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then bring on a thick, juicy steak, a baked potato loaded with
butter and sour cream,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dessert,'' Davis said, ``well, that's got to be ice cream, fat
Blue Bell ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders had started laughing by then, adding: ``Of course, we do
this for Basil.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell smiled. It was like that day watching film all over
again. It's a good feeling, too, knowing that come Thursday he has
the five big guys on his side.

ADJUSTING NOTHING NEW TO TEXAS A&AMP;M'S STEWART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Mentally, the transition to life after football
was in full swing for Branndon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week, the Stephenville native would be in
Virginia for his third interview with an industrial distribution
firm. The prospect of his first real-world job offer excited him.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the fifth-year senior owed his Texas A&AMP;M teammates
another afternoon of clipboard holding as the backup quarterback to
Randy McCown. As the Big 12 title game approached, Stewart shared
his deepest regret with punter Shane Lechler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm ever going to play again,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the start of a Wednesday practice. By the time
the workout ended, McCown was headed for X-rays that would reveal a
broken collarbone and Stewart was headed back to the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Within 72 hours, the normally reserved Stewart would be
shouting, ``That's for you, Lee Corso,'' into television minicams
after leading the Aggies to a stunning, 36-33 upset of Kansas State
to win the Big 12 title. Corso, ESPN's college football analyst,
predicted a three-touchdown victory by the Wildcats, who entered
the game as the top-ranked team nationally in the coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made that prediction laughable by throwing for 235 yards
and three touchdowns during the fourth quarter and overtime. The
performance also made him rethink plans about his football future,
although Stewart concedes he is ``geared for'' the idea that
Friday's Sugar Bowl against Ohio State will be his last appearance
in shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M (11-2), ranked No. 8 in The Associated Press poll, meets No.
3 Ohio State (10-1) at 7:30 p.m. in the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think about playing your last game, but that's
what I'm geared for right now,'' said Stewart, whose turbulent
college career has been marked by two benchings during three
seasons in which he has compiled a 20-10 record as A&AMP;M's starting
quarterback. ``Throughout my career, I got some unjustified
criticism. But I've enjoyed playing here. I know people may not
think so because every game hasn't been great. It's been fun to me,
though, regardless of the comments and critiques. All of that stuff
goes away, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stewart, the key has been learning to balance his own hopes
and dreams against outsiders' expectations. After leading
Stephenville to the 1993 Class 4A state championship, many
recruiters _ as well as Stephenville coach Art Briles _ predicted
Stewart was on a collision course with the Heisman Trophy, if not
an early exit to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has been a reliable college quarterback but never an
all-conference performer. These days, when Stewart talks about
playing in the NFL, it is in terms of a backup role. If he heads
off to the work-a-day world rather than some NFL camp after
completing his management degree in May, Stewart said he will have
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Football, he explained, has fallen in line behind other
interests on his personal pecking order during his tenure at A&AMP;M.
Among them: religion, academics and relationships with friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I learned how to put football in its proper perspective
with everything else, it was easy to put a bad game or a bad
practice behind me,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of both for a quarterback who ranks
fourth on A&AMP;M's career passing list, with 4,325 yards, yet never
threw for more than 10 touchdowns in any season. There have been
plenty of mountaintop moments as well, although none can top
Stewart's 324-yard effort in leading A&AMP;M to victory from a 27-12
fourth-quarter deficit against Kansas State. That one, after all,
triggered 47 congratulatory messages on Stewart's telephone
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens against Ohio State, Stewart figures
the Kansas State comeback will be his A&AMP;M legacy. A&AMP;M coach R.C.
Slocum said he will remember something else. He has seen a young
quarterback mature into manhood and watched some of that maturity
rub off on fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always empathized with Branndon because he lived in a
fish bowl and he was never the one who built himself up ... to be
this big-time, first-round draft choice with a pro-style arm,''
Slocum said. ``The reality is that most people who play college
football aren't great players. There are few legitimate stars.''
</P>
<P>
   How soon Stewart's real-world life will begin is open to
conjecture. The interview in Virginia, which took place two days
after Stewart's heroics in the Big 12 title game, led to a job
offer. But the strong showing on the football field has Stewart
wondering about how soon he wants to hang up his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could handle a backup role in the NFL,'' Stewart
said. ``But I don't talk about the pros. I don't even ask my
coaches about the pros. It's something I would love to do if I get
a chance, but I don't focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stewart is focusing on making the most of his final
college game Friday night against Ohio State. After that, anything
is possible. Even a mental transition back to the role of full-time
football player.

HATCH SAYS NOT ENOUGH SENATE VOTES TO CONVICT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A powerful Republican Senate committee chairman said
here Monday night that there are not enough votes in the Senate to
convict President Clinton of impeachment charges and that censure
of the president is ``the only option left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think censure is not going to be a powerful tool
against him, you are wrong,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told a
large audience of anti-Clinton conservatives at a Sea-Tac hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that any
penalty beyond censure, such as denying Clinton a pension or
imposing a fine, would violate the president's rights under the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, he said, the president could pay off any fine just
by holding two fundraisers at the Malibu estate of singer and
Clinton supporter Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton agrees to some form of censure, and his lawyers do
not challenge the legality of the impeachment action by the
outgoing Congress, ``My feeling is this could be over in a matter
of days,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch was in the Puget Sound area to visit his daughter, and
appeared Monday night as a guest of Wade Cook Seminars. Hatch
lectured on national policy after Cook spoke on money-making
techniques and gave out copies of his new book, ``Y2K Gold Rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch heaped scorn on Clinton, virtually pronouncing the
president's guilt on the impeachment allegation that he lied before
the federal grand jury convened by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate lying before a federal grand jury,'' Hatch
declared. ``If you were to do that, you go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't he?'' demanded voices in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he is opposed to jailing presidents and believes that
Clinton deserves to be treated with respect because of the office
that he holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah senator did serve up plenty of partisan meat to an
appreciative audience. He described Vice President Al Gore as ``a
committed left-winger. ... He is committed to the far left.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he opposes calling any witnesses at a Senate trial of
the president, outside from House Judiciary Committee members who
are managing the impeachment case. He specifically opposed Senate
appearances by the academics who argued the president's case before
the House Judiciary Committee, ``these historians,'' as Hatch
called them, ``most of who are far-left liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is a Senate grandee, a 22-year veteran of Congress' upper
chamber who delights in telling about his audiences with China's
President Jiang Zemin and the savvy advice he has given past
presidents that, to their detriment, they refused to take.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a Mormon bishop who has personally counseled
colleagues, kept their private confidences, and as a musician has
even composed a song to his Judiciary Committee colleague and
political opposite Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   This side of Hatch has been on display through much of 1998. He
privately urged Clinton's attorneys to settle the Paula Jones
lawsuit, which eventually gave Starr the vehicle to move on
impeachment. He went on Sunday talk shows to advise Clinton on how
to get out of the burgeoning Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't listen to me,'' Hatch said. He even argued the
case personally to Clinton during a half-hour phone call before one
Sunday talk-show appearance. After Clinton went before Starr's
federal grand jury, and later delivered a brief defensive speech to
the nation, Hatch was quoted as saying, ``What a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a jerk to blame Ken Starr for what he had done and put
the nation through,'' Hatch reiterated Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked by an audience member whether the title ``the
unhonorable'' should be attached to William Jefferson Clinton,
Hatch shot back: ``No. No. You should still have respect for that
office regardless of who holds it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the counselor in Orrin Hatch appear to have given up on
America's 42nd president any more than Richard Nixon, the 37th
president who was disgraced and resigned his office more than 24
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the blessings of my life was to have private one-on-one
meetings with Richard Nixon after he left office,'' Hatch said.
``He has worked hard to rehabilitate himself. He was one of
America's great statesmen when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe William Jefferson Clinton can still do the same.''

MILLER SAD TO SEE COLLEGE CAREER NEARING END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ The season ends in two days, and USC wide receiver
Billy Miller is feeling a bit melancholy as his career winds down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming to an end quick,'' Miller said. ``I realize I'm
not going to do this anymore, hanging out at the hotel with my
friends. It's very sad. It's another opportunity to make another
step in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller has rarely been thought of as the Trojans' go-to
receiver, and has often been overshadowed by R. Jay Soward, he is
currently fifth all-time on USC's career-pass catching list, and
will move into fourth place with two receptions in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to me. People don't know. Even if you told them,
they wouldn't believe you,'' Miller said. ``If you asked someone in
Alabama who Billy Miller was, they wouldn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It also surprises Miller how far he has come, considering that
he nearly quit playing football his sophomore season after becoming
upset with the coaches and wondering about his role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I wouldn't have even gone out at night if we
went to a bowl,'' Miller said. ``I would have felt like everybody
looked at me like I was a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's thoughts are beginning to turn to the NFL, and he knows
his speed will be the biggest concern among teams that watch him at
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to shock a lot of people with how fast I
am,'' Miller said. ``A lot of people doubt my speed. I think I can
get down to a 4.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamber of Commerce: USC offensive lineman Travis Claridge
never minces words, and had this opinion of spending the week here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the armpit of El Paso and they don't use deodorant,''
Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   But just to make sure he didn't offend anyone, Claridge added,
``The people are really nice and considerate.''
</P>
<P>
   The thin red line: USC's defensive line is a little short on
depth, as sophomore Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed missed Monday's
practice with a sore shoulder. Aaron Williams is still less than
100 percent with an ankle sprain, meaning the tackle position could
consist primarily of Ennis Davis, Marc Matock and freshman Ryan
Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensive tackle is scary,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``Ryan Nielsen will have to play a big role.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson looks better: Hackett was encouraged by linebacker David
Gibson's recovery from a sprained ankle, and thought Gibson might
be able to start. If not, senior Marc Cusano will start.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton (sore ankle) practiced sparingly but is
supposed to be OK for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl man: TCU has not played in a bowl since 1994, but wide
receiver Mike Scarborough is playing in his third bowl game.
Scarborough transferred from Texas, where he played in the 1997
Fiesta Bowl and 1995 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Flip of the coin: USC clearly has an inferior practice site to
TCU, but it's partly the Trojans' choice. The teams held a coin
flip earlier in the month to decide who would have first pick for
hotels or practice facilities.
</P>
<P>
   USC went for the hotel site first, which meant TCU got to
practice at the nicer Socorro Athletic Complex, which has a
well-maintained grass field. USC practiced at a local high school
Sunday and Monday, on a field with virtually no green grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dirt, it's dormant grass,'' Hackett joked.

FRANCHIONE REINVENTS TCU TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ Dennis Franchione has become known as a quick-change
artist, but there's nothing deceptive about his act.
</P>
<P>
   It just seems like he's using tricks, because Franchione has
resurrected some of college football's sorriest schools in recent
years, and become a model for anyone hoping to turn around their
struggling programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe that's what I've become known for,'' Franchione
said. ``I hope my reputation carries some other things too, but you
get known for something somewhere down the line. Hopefully, this is
my last turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian University certainly does. Franchione was hired
last December and brought back self-esteem to a school that won two
national titles in the 1930s but hasn't done much in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs were 1-10 last season, and coach Pat Sullivan
was fired.
</P>
<P>
   With a no-nonsense style that combined discipline and loyalty,
Franchione has surprised even himself by leading TCU to a 6-5
record and a berth in the Sun Bowl against USC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been much quicker than I expected,'' he said. ``I don't
think you can go into a season inheriting a 1-10 team and think
you'll go to a bowl game the first year. I don't know if you can
know what to expect for sure. I felt like there was talent there,
just some other ingredients were missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like faith. And trust. And positive reinforcement. Those were
the pillars Franchione used to build up the Horned Frogs, and his
players have completely bought into his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of charisma and is a real genuine person,'' said
linebacker Joseph Phipps, an All-WAC first-team selection. ``When
you believe in someone, you're willing to do more for that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The players feel anything is possible since Franchione arrived
and instilled self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes you feel like you can win, no matter who you're
playing against,'' added wide receiver Michael Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent from the season's first game. TCU traveled to
Iowa State and trailed 21-14 entering the fourth quarter. This
would normally be the time for the Horned Frogs to collapse and
take another typical loss.
</P>
<P>
   But they outscored Iowa State 21-0 in the final period and won
31-21. That might not sound like a big deal for a USC fan, but it
was TCU's first road victory in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a turning point,'' Franchione said. ``They didn't do
that last year. Every time something bad happened, the players
responded against Iowa State. In previous years, they would have
faltered.''
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the season occurred two weeks later, when the
Horned Frogs upset Air Force 35-34, handing the Falcons their only
loss of the season and perhaps costing them a spot in a BCS bowl
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most memorable memories I've ever had was to be in
the locker room after the Air Force game,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make Franchione a darling with the TCU fans. The
last TCU coach to post a winning record in his first season was
Dutch Meyer in 1934. The Horned Frogs' defense is allowing 19.6
points per game, the fewest points in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has also become a master at learning how to handle a
'90's football player. ``Players today always want to know why. I
give them a lot of ownership in the decision-making process,''
Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Franchione appointed a leadership council
composed of players from each position on the team. They discuss a
variety of issues and report back to the coach with their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just figured out what style of bowl rings we wanted this
week,'' quarterback Patrick Batteaux said. ``We'll come together
collectively and decide things. He lets us have input.''
</P>
<P>
   Transforming a football program is hardly new for Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   At New Mexico, Franchione won 33 games in six years after the
team won a total of of nine games in the nine previous seasons
before he arrived. He took the Lobos to a bowl game, something they
hadn't done in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask former UCLA defensive coordinator Rocky Long how tough
the New Mexico job could be. The Lobos were 3-9 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before New Mexico, Franchione compiled two winning seasons at
Southwest Texas State, which had five straight losing seasons
before his arrival. At Pittsburg State in Kansas, he had a 53-6
record including a 45-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a struggling school is in need of a quick fix,
Franchione's name surfaces. He was mentioned for the Oklahoma job
way back in September, but said he wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying I'm not going to do it anymore. It's consuming,
but it's gratifying,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he likes what he thinks he can build at TCU. There are
1.7 million people in Tarrant County, where TCU is situated in the
city of Fort Worth. That's about the population of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt in his mind that taking the TCU job was a
step up, not to mention the doubling of his salary to about
$400,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you survey Division I coaches, a lot of people said TCU was
a sleeping giant,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean this could this be his final stop, after so many
makeovers?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd ask my wife, I'd say this is home,'' Franchione said.
</P>

NBA LOCKOUT RHETORIC HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA could cancel the season in nine days, but
instead of that threat forcing the sides into compromise, it has
spawned a new round of insults and accusations that seem to
inevitably point toward a destructive ending to the 181-day
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern nearly assured as much Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in all likelihood, the season will be canceled on
Jan. 7,'' Stern said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his angriest sermon yet, Stern blasted union leadership and
insisted the league will make no further concessions. The league
made its final offer to the players union on Sunday, and Stern said
if the union rejects it, the season is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Union director Billy Hunter rejected the offer Sunday and
reiterated his position strongly Monday, setting the stage for a
tense final stretch in the six-month-old labor war.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter maintained, as he has all along, that owners would
not cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 29 franchises that in the aggregate are worth about
$5-$6 billion,'' Hunter said. ``Are you going to jeopardize your $6
billion investment, particularly when we're so close at the table,
over a few million dollars?''
</P>
<P>
   He chalked up Stern's threats to ``psychological games.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Hunter's comments, Stern responded incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he (Hunter) didn't believe that the National Labor
Relations Board would dismiss the unfair labor practice suit (by
the union), and he didn't believe that (arbitrator John) Feerick
would (rule) against him, and he didn't believe that the owners
would lock out, and he didn't believe that we would lose
regular-season games, and he didn't believe that we would miss
Christmas Day, and he didn't believe we would cancel the All-Star
Game,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, sarcastically, ``So his analysis of this is right
on target. ... And on Jan. 8, he'll turn to his players and say,
`Guess what, I was wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   The league's presumed final offer includes a guarantee players
will receive 53 to 54 percent of the league's $2 billion in
revenues. The union said it will not accept anything less than 56
to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the union has agreed to numerous restrictions on
high-end salaries, Hunter said those concessions are dependent upon
more salary-cap exceptions for middle-class salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik, reflecting the league's new,
decidedly less diplomatic tone, responded, ``I think one of the
great lies from the other side ... is that this has anything to do
with the middle class. I think it's clear that what's going on is
about the high-end players.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter contended that if talks reconvened with full negotiating
committees, the gap could be bridged quickly. ``My players want to
participate in the process. I would think it's important enough
that they (owners) would want to participate also.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he would not bring in the owners' negotiating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any more negotiations,'' Granik said. ``We
have given the fairest and most generous offer that we can and
still (be able to) operate the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the league has made its final offer, Hunter said he
will not send the proposal to the full union membership for a vote.
The union's 19-player negotiating committee, he said, is authorized
to accept or reject any proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hunter confidently asserted that ``80 to 85
percent'' of the 430 players support the union's position and would
reject the owners' offer.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials believe otherwise and Stern plans to send his
offer directly to the players, repeating a strategy he used two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of players want the opportunity to vote on that
proposal, said Steve Woods, agent for the Toronto Raptors' Kevin
Willis and a vocal critic of Hunter. Woods and a half-dozen other
agents have been polling players and Woods said about 90 percent
would approve the NBA's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's reluctance to put this to a group vote really
illustrates the weakness of his overall position,'' Woods said.
``If he truly believes that 85 percent of the players support the
union's position on this, then it would only be to his advantage to
institute a blind vote.''

LAVIN RELIES ON YOUTH, ENTHUSIASM OF BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You walk into UCLA's locker room at Pauley
Pavilion, see the bodies rolling around on the floor and assume
it's egos colliding. Isn't that the inevitable result, after all,
when so many exalted underclassmen are asked to share one ball?
</P>
<P>
   Then you hear the muffled giggles rising from the carpet and you
realize the kids are all right. Indeed, sophomores Travis Reed and
Baron Davis were just being playful (think Winnie the Pooh and
Tigger) after a lethargic win last week over American University. A
more energetic effort on the court tonight against Loyola Marymount
would be a welcomed sight, what with the Bruins' Pacific-10 opener
against Arizona a mere four days away.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, half the fun of following this season's squad will be
seeing which of its multiple personalities surface on any given
night. Imagine Sybil in knee-length shorts and you've got a clear
vision of a team whose first eight players average 19.3 years of
age. The UCLA team is so young, third-year coach Steve Lavin
recycles cliches that are older.
</P>
<P>
   A Lavinism that figures to get plenty of mileage this season is
``age is just a number.'' The youthfulness of the 1996-97 Arizona
team hardly was its downfall; those Wildcats won the national
championship with a top-eight that averaged 19.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   That Arizona squad didn't have a senior or a selfish player
among its regular contributors. Neither, at first glance, does this
band of Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lavin wasn't worried at first. After landing the top
recruiting class in the country, Lavin had no idea how all the egos
would mesh. He wondered, would such an infusion of untested talent
erode team chemistry or enhance it?
</P>
<P>
   Much to Lavin's delight, the team has been, in his words, ``like
a pack of wolves or a flock of ducks in the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   They're like brothers, only without the baggage. The 10th-ranked
Bruins are a surrogate family out of necessity, so many of the
players having left behind all that is familiar for this shared
experience. The team boasts only three players from Los Angeles
(Davis, Billy Knight and Ryan Bailey). Everybody else is at least
an hour's drive or flight away from their comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of them are away from home,'' Lavin said, ``so it's a
commonality that they all share.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that sophomore Todd Ramasar took freshmen Dan
Gadzuric, who hails from Den Haag, Holland, and Jerome Moiso
(Guadeloupe, West Indies) home with him to Corona for Thanksgiving
and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that sophomore Earl Watson counsels freshman JaRon Rush
of Kansas City, Mo., on homesickness and Davis dispenses hugs in
the locker room as though they were towels and everyone really
looks forward to each day's practice, no matter how many line
sprints they end up doing.
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry on the court is hard to coach but easy to observe.
It's Davis being so focused on getting his teammates involved in
the offense that he sometimes forgets to take his own shots. It's
Moiso offering to bench himself to give Gadzuric more looks at the
basket. It's the perimeter players having no compunction at
throwing it inside and the players in the paint having no qualms at
kicking it back out.
</P>
<P>
   It's being 7-2 and feeling as though the best is yet to come
because everybody is really eager to share the ball, the credit and
a meal and movie afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's different than what we've had in the past,'' said
Lavin, who was a Bruins assistant coach for five years before
assuming the lead position in 1996 after Jim Harrick's abrupt
firing. ``There were other teams where the core players were really
close, but this is the closest-knit team we've had in terms of the
first man through the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times this year I've gotten chills up my spine
because the things I've seen have transcended anything you can
articulate in words.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 14 players on this year's roster are 19 or 20. Three
of the freshmen (Ray Young, Gadzuric and Moiso) are in the upper
tier, age-wise, which has helped blur the distinction between
classes. That wasn't the case last year when the three seniors
(J.R. Henderson, Kris Johnson and Toby Bailey) who anchored the
team sort of drifted apart from their younger teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had that age difference,'' Watson said, speaking
of the gulf that divides someone old enough to vote from someone
old enough to drink. ``This year we're all on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the 1998-99 Bruins can scale the same heights as
the 1997-98 UCLA Sweet-Sixteen team remains to be seen. But say
this for them: they sure look like they're having a lot more fun
trying.

KINGS TRAP COYOTES ON THE ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For nearly three months, little has gone right for the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, almost everything did.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got two goals from Luc Robitaille and two goals from
Jozef Stumpel, one of them _ gasp _ on the power play. The Kings
also got a strong performance in goal from Jamie Storr on his 23rd
birthday. And they got the appropriate emotional response when Doug
Bodger was viciously hit from behind by Coyotes winger Dallas Drake
in the waning minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a 4-2 victory over the Kings' nemesis, the
Phoenix Coyotes, before a sellout crowd of 16,210 at the America
West Arena. The Coyotes (20-7-4, 10-2-1 at home) not only lost the
game, they lost star winger Keith Tkachuk to bruised ribs and star
center Jeremy Roenick to a possible concussion.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings (11-21-3), it was their third win in their last
four games and their third consecutive victory on the road. Only
Bodger's sore right arm and a possible mild concussion to
defenseman Mattias Norstrom marred the Kings' night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big two points,'' said Robitaille, whose goals drew him
to within four of 500 for his career. ``We're starting to build a
lot of confidence as a team. This is the kind of game we want to
play every night, physical, in-your-face. We want to play like they
play. If we can do that, we can go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr kept the Kings in the game by holding the Coyotes
scoreless in a first period in which Phoenix had a 13-4 advantage
in shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Stumpel - who entered the game with five
goals in his previous 46 regular-season and playoff games - gave
the Kings the lead off a pass from Pavel Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-King Rick Tocchet and Daniel Briere responded with goals to
give the Coyotes the lead, but with 38 seconds to play in the
second period (39 seconds after Briere's goal), Robitaille poked in
a pass from Donald Audette, tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille then gave the Kings the lead 12:09 into the third
period, scoring after Jyrki Lumme lost his balance - and the puck -
deep in the Coyotes' zone. Stumpel cushioned the lead 2:33 later,
on the Kings' first power play of the night, when he scored on a
breakaway set up by Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Drake's hit, possibly in retaliation for Bodger's hit
earlier in the third period on Roenick, a play on which Roenick's
head slammed against the glass.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:25 to play, Bodger was chasing the puck deep into the
Kings' zone, with Drake in pursuit. Bodger looked once over his
shoulder, then again. As he reached the boards, he was driven into
them from behind by Drake. Bodger said later he was woozy at first,
and his right elbow was wrapped in ice after the game. Drake's hit
will be reviewed by NHL vice president Colin Campbell, who may
respond with a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a suspension,'' Bodger said, ``there's something
wrong with this league. Getting hit from behind, there's a chance
you could break your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bodger writhed on the ice, Ray Ferraro, then Robitaille, then
Sean O'Donnell jumped on Drake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Dallas Drake a long time,'' Ferraro said. ``Dallas
is a hard hitter and sometimes his hits border on the dirty side.
But that's the way he plays. The thing that was bad about the hit
was he didn't even make an attempt to slow down. His intent was to
hurt (Bodger), no question. That's why that hit has to be dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had complaints of their own about the play, with
Coach Jim Schoenfeld claiming that O'Donnell had step out of bounds
in his retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call was made with the major and misconduct, and that's
fine, that's hockey,'' said Schoenfeld, adding that he didn't think
Drake's hit warranted a suspension. ``The eye-gouging from behind
(by O'Donnell) ... let's face up the two guys straight on.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell denied Schoenfeld's allegation, and Drake did not
speak with reporters after the game.

UCLA WOMEN FALL TO DUKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Was it another stumble on the way to the Pac-10,
or was it another sign of things to come?
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has been established: The ninth-ranked UCLA's
women's basketball team relies on Maylana Martin and Janae Hubbard
inside and Erica Gomez and Marie Philman outside.
</P>
<P>
   When they click, watch out. When they're off, well ... it's
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the quartet was more off than on, and that
helped spell defeat, 85-80 to No. 17 Duke in front of 3,629 at
Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The loss follows a 100-77 defeat to No. 2 Tennessee a week ago.
It is the second time the Bruins (7-4) have lost two straight to
nationally-ranked teams. UCLA started the year with losses at Notre
Dame and at home to Connecticut before running off seven
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these two losses will mean another seven-game win streak,
which would mean a 6-0 start in the conference (UCLA closes its
nonconference schedule Wednesday at home against Pepperdine). No
one would complain if it were to happen, but the Bruins realize
that is getting a little too far ahead, especially when there are
things to be concerned about now.
</P>
<P>
   Like what to do when Martin, Hubbard, Gomez and Philman are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Philman was something like 1 for 10 from the field,''
Gomez said. ``Philman's usually an offensive machine (12-point
average). To have two people off, that really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just two, however. Martin, who has had a degenerative
disk in her back since last season, played Monday with a sinus
infection. She scored 14 points but had just three rebounds, well
below her 11.5 average.
</P>
<P>
   Philman did shoot 1 for 10 from the field but made all six of
her free throws. Hubbard has had the flu, so she was a step off,
finishing with 14 points and 9 rebounds but committing a critical
turnover in the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez had just four assists despite playing the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA went on a 29-6 run in the first half, only to give up runs
of 11-2 in the first half and 16-4 in the second half to bring Duke
back.
</P>
<P>
   The story was the same on defense. Duke (9-4) likes to go inside
to 6-foot-6 Michele Van Gorp, but the Bruins, helped by her
first-half foul trouble, limited her to 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   All that did was open the door to the outside game. Led by
Georgia Schweitzer's 22 points _ including 18 in the second half
and 10 straight at one point _ the Blue Devils shot 53 percent from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-three percent, that's pretty good against UCLA,'' Duke
coach Gail Goestenkors said. ``We took what they gave us, and the
outside shot was there, especially in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there enough depth for the Bruins to compete in the Pac-10?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes and no,'' Gomez said. ``We need other people.''
</P>
<P>
   There was LaCresha Flannigan leading the Bruins with 15 points.
Needed, but not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had our people at 100 percent,'' UCLA coach Kathy
Olivier mused. ``I don't want to say it would be a different
outcome, but I'd like to think so.''

HAWKS FIRE ERICKSON, SEEK FOURTH COACH THIS DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Dennis Erickson leaves a team that is much
better than the one he inherited four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the Seahawks are not good enough, which is why
Erickson was fired Monday as head coach after compiling a 31-33
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks never reached the playoffs under Erickson, or even
posted a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of stuck at this 8-8 hurdle for the last four
years,'' club president Bob Whitsitt said. ``And although that's a
good mark _ it's better than where the franchise was before Dennis
got here and I do think he did a good job getting us there _ we
need to get over that hurdle, and there are a few more hurdles we
have to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt said he had reached the point where Erickson would
either be fired with one year remaining on his contract, or have
his contract extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the organization) chose to shake hands and move on,''
Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will now hire their fourth head coach in the 1990s
_ following Chuck Knox, the winningest coach in franchise history
who was fired after the '91 season; Tom Flores, who was fired after
the '94 season; and Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt said he had yet to begin compiling a list of
candidates, and no calls were made Monday to set up interviews or
ask permission to talk to coaches who are under contract with other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But league sources said the Seahawks are expected to be a player
in the Mike Holmgren sweepstakes. Holmgren is under contract in
Green Bay, but has a clause in his contract that gives him a 21-day
window after the Packers are eliminated from the playoffs to take
another job if it includes the title of general manager and coach.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when Whitsitt was looking to hire a GM, he said he
wanted a general manager and a coach, not one person to handle both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Whitsitt changed that tune, offering, ``We'll be open to
all possibilities and I don't want to rule anything out, certainly
not on the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt also said, however, that he was not looking to make any
more changes in the front office. Asked about vice president of
football operations Randy Mueller, who has been handling the GM
duties without the title, Whitsitt offered, ``I think Randy's done
a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mueller: ``My ego is not a factor. I want us to get the
right guy for the job. ... I don't think we want to rule out
anybody or any type situation at this stage. Our search has to be
all-encompassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucking up the Seahawks' pursuit is the fact that four other
head coaches were fired Monday, leaving seven vacancies in the
league. That could grow to 10, depending upon developments in
Washington, Green Bay and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like they trotted out the firing squad, and the blood
started running,'' Knox said about Monday's rash of dismissals.
``Everybody in the business knows it's a job with no security, but
you don't expect something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt did not seem overly concerned that so many other teams
also could be vying for the candidates the Seahawks might be
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to rush it, and we're not going to drag our
feet,'' he said. ``We're going to get into the process and try to
do it in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no timetable, either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because so many of the top candidates are coordinators
for teams that are in the playoffs and will be off limits to the
Seahawks until their seasons have been completed. That would
include Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, Vikings
offensive coordinator Brian Billick and Jaguars offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Available immediately are George Seifert, the former 49ers coach
turned broadcaster who interviewed with the Carolina Panthers last
night; and Jim Haslett, the Steelers' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Paul Allen wants the best coach available, and Whitsitt
believes the Seahawks offer the best situation.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, offensive guard Brian Habib has a
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Paul Allen wants to get the best coach in the National
Football League, he has to go to Denver and get Mike Shanahan out
of his contract, which I don't think he'll be able to do,'' Habib
said. ``If he can't do that, then he has to get somebody who was
either a mentor to Mike or mentored by Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of potential candidates is laced with these
mentor/pupil types. Seifert and Holmgren would be the mentors;
Kubiak the mentored.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it all over the league now,'' Habib said of the
ever-growing roots from the 49ers' family tree. ``All the
successful teams, a lot of the coaches there have come from the
49ers and the Bill Walsh system. Say what you will, I still believe
that is probably the best offensive system in the history of the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The new coach will not come from the
assistants Erickson leaves behind.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of them have contracts that expire next month and it is
unlikely that any will be retained by the new coach. Six others are
under contract for at least another season. Management would like
to retain some of them _ especially special teams coach Pete
Rodriguez and linebackers coach Jim Johnson _ to ease the
transition. But those decisions will be up to the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose contracts will expire are free to pursue other jobs,
and defensive coordinator Greg McMackin is said to be in line to
join the staff that former Chargers coach June Jones is compiling
at the University of Hawaii. McMackin would be the associate head
coach and defensive coordinator, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   While most connected with the team, including the players,
figured Erickson was a goner for the past six weeks, Whitsitt said
it was a difficult decision that was made over a three-year
evaluation process rather than anything that happened in recent
games. Whitsitt said he talked to Allen on Sunday night after the
Seahawks lost their season finale in Denver, then broke the news to
Erickson Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he wanted to continue to coach this team,'' Whitsitt
said of Erickson. ``It's not one of the meetings you want to have.
... It's tough to get the words and it can be a lot more difficult
depending upon how the person reacts, and Dennis was very
professional in the way he handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson will be paid $1 million for the final year of his
contract, so he doesn't have to coach next season. But he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to coach,'' he said. ``That's the only thing I
know how to do. That's something that I would like to do and we've
just got to wait and see what happens. Right now, I'm just going to
sit back for a couple of days and just kind of look at the
situation and see what opportunities are there and then go ahead
and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondayh's move was a tough one, but also one management felt it
had no choice but to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis brought us to a certain level. He should be commended
for that,'' Mueller said. ``The unfortunate part of this business
is that if improvement isn't seen by the people at the top, then
changes have to be made.''

SEAHAWKS HANG HELP-WANTED SIGN FOR BEST COACHING JOB IN NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Someone asked Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt Monday
if he had a short list of coaching candidates to replace the
dismissed Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no list,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Whitsitt was smiling as he conceded the Seahawks have no
short list for their head coaching vacancy. Nor do they have a long
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find the best person for the job,'' Whitsitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, we are told, are starting from scratch. Actually, we
are told Monday's dismissal of Erickson should start ``smoking
out'' the best suspects for his successor.
</P>
<P>
   George Seifert, the only potential candidate with no strings
attached _ especially after the laconic Seifert was booted from his
CBS studio gig _ was not trotted out moments after Whitsitt
announced Erickson's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks cut Erickson loose with no replacement waiting in the
wings, which is understandable since many potential successors are
off-limits for interviews because their teams are playoff-bound.
</P>
<P>
   But picking the new Seahawk coach will be an interesting
learning process, Whitsitt said. Interesting, no doubt. Fruitful,
one can only hope, even for a franchise as loaded, as attractive as
the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it just got brutal out there.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Monday Morning Massacre that took place in the NFL
when five head coaches were axed before lunch, there are now seven
NFL teams in search of a new head coach. And there could be eight,
should Steve Mariucci leave San Francisco, as has been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   That is going to make for a wicked game of coaching musical
chairs, destined to stretch out until Mike Holmgren's season is
done in Green Bay, or one organization is going to have to make the
first, bold, shark-attack move in order to set the coaching
dominoes falling.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, if we heard Whitsitt correctly, believe they have a
chance to set the tone, establish the market. If the Seahawks
lacked competitiveness on the field this past season, Whitsitt has
all but guaranteed Seattle fans _ and the NFL in general _ that the
Hawks now aim to level the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course maybe I'm prejudiced,'' Whitsitt said about what
the franchise has to offer. ``I am very confident that Seattle is
the best opportunity. We're getting a new stadium. It's a great
place to live. There is a great talent base. ... I believe this is
the best place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: In ranking NFL teams according to
attractiveness for potential new head coaches, how do the Hawks
rate? Whitsitt obviously believes Seattle is No. 1. He will get a
lot of support in that mindset, too.
</P>
<P>
   But there is room for quibbling here. For example, this is what
each job has to offer:
</P>
<P>
   1. San Francisco: Just because of history, tradition and the
system a coach would inherit.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cleveland: An expansion franchise stocked with former 49er
personnel in a football-crazed city that went nuts to bring back
its beloved Browns. No pressure to win right away. Great position
in draft. Great potential to become playoff contender after first
two or three seasons, just like Panthers and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   3. Seattle: Loaded with talent and cash. Chance to win right
away. Summers in Cheney. Tough transition as new stadium is built
and Hawks play at Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carolina: When they lost Bill Polian to Indianapolis,
Panthers lost a general manager who can put together a winner. This
is a job waiting for the Packers' Holmgren, who wants to be king as
well as coach.
</P>
<P>
   5. Chicago: Clueless owner, rash of bad personnel decisions
under Dave Wannstedt. But this is a town where Mike Ditka was
lionized, where Dick Butkus and Walter Payton ruled. If you win,
you're the toast of the town. Lose and you're just plain toast.
</P>
<P>
   6. San Diego: The weather.
</P>
<P>
   7. Baltimore: Art Modell.
</P>
<P>
   8. Philadelphia: Why is Ray Rhodes so happily whistling
``Philadelphia Freedom'' on his way out of town? Tough fans. Awful
stadium. Paltry roster. Tough town.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you slice it, Seattle comes out on top or near the top
of anyone's list. That said, no amount of confidence about how
great Seattle is can completely assure the Hawks of getting the
best person.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Steelers general manager Tom Donahoe about his trip to
Seattle last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, in the Hawks' attempt to lure a front-line general
manager, at least one top candidate left his interview session
dismayed at the lack of football know-how within the power ranks of
the Seahawk organization.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, maybe decisions by top candidates such as Holmgren,
Seifert, Rhodes or top assistants such as Denver's Gary Kubiak or
Minnesota's Brian Billick or Jacksonville's Chris Palmer aren't
quite so predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt is the first to tell you he is no football guy. Saying
the Seahawks are the most attractive opening out there does not
discount the kinds of circuitous negotiations that lead a candidate
to his final destination. Sometimes a ``destination city'' such as
Seattle gets rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seahawks are going to be here. The team's already been
saved. We want it improved,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   To make that happen, Whitsitt may not have the hardest sell
among NFL teams in search of a new head coach. But he doesn't have
a slam dunk either.

FULMER CLOSE TO $1 MILLION DEAL WITH TENNESSEE, PAPER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer is close to signing a new
contract that will raise his financial package to more than $1
million per year, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessean said the deal is expected to come before Monday's
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer had no comment Monday, but Volunteers Athletic Director
Doug Dickey, who is in the Valley for the game, told The Arizona
Republic that ``we don't speculate. When we do it, we'll do it and
it will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer's current base salary is $150,000, plus $150,000 in
endorsements, $320,000 from radio and TV programs and a $125,000
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Just before last year's Orange Bowl, he received a one-year
extension through 2003 and a $145,000 raise that increased his
yearly package to $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer would earn close to a $40,000 bonus if the Volunteers
defeat Florida State and win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee President Joe Johnson told the Associated Press that a
new contract with a raise was expected to be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't signed off on anything yet,'' Johnson said. ``But
we will do one, and I assume quickly. We want to treat Phil
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The new contract would make him the second-highest-paid coach in
the Southeastern Conference behind Florida's Steve Spurrier, who
has a six-year deal worth $11.7 million. &QL;  &QL; 
Card game &QL;  &QL; 
Several Tennessee players said they were caught up in Sunday's
Cardinals victory over the San Diego Chargers, which was televised.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will play the Dallas Cowboys in the opening round
of the NFL playoffs Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the city and it's great for the team to finally
get to the playoffs,'' wide receiver Peerless Price said. ``But
I've got to say, I hope they lose to Dallas. The Cowboys are my
favorite team.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Reunion &QL;  &QL; 
Tennessee tailback Travis Henry said there is special incentive to
play well against Florida State. One of his childhood friends,
running back Jeff Chaney, plays for the Seminoles. Henry grew up in
Frostproof, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Little League with him,'' Henry said. ``I went to
junior high with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went home, I saw him. He said he hopes that I have a
good game. I hope he has a good game.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Destined? &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Volunteers (12-0) have acquired the ``team of
destiny'' tag for all of their close, last-minute victories.
</P>
<P>
   But they say none of that matters now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put our whole season behind us, how we won, all that,''
quarterback Tee Martin said. ``We're not thinking of us as the team
of destiny, but being the best team on Monday night.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Quick hits &QL;  &QL; 
The media demand for the game has far exceeded the typical 350 to
400 requests. Fiesta Bowl public relations manager Shawn Schoeffler
already has issued 500 passes for press box writers, 350 for
sideline photographers, 250 for special duty reporters in the
stands, 100 for messengers, 75 for ESPN and 300 for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   If Jeremaine Copeland is sporting a large Afro this summer,
that's bad news for the Volunteers. The receiver, who usually has a
close-cropped hairdo, is letting it grow long and said he will only
cut it if Tennessee wins. &QL;  &QL;

HUSKERS HAVE ROOTS IN DESERT  
 JOHNSON, CHEATHAM, BROWN FROM VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Nebraska's Kenny Cheatham, Eric Johnson and Mike
Brown had it all pictured.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would they crown their 1998 season with a national
championship, they'd win it at Sun Devil Stadium, just a few miles
from where each grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred to play in Tempe,'' said Cheatham, a
senior receiver who played at South Mountain High School. ``That
would have been great, especially for us from Phoenix and for
myself because it will be my last game.''
</P>
<P>
   But that fantasy ended in the sixth week of Nebraska's season
when the Cornhuskers were beaten by Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted by injuries, the Cornhuskers finished 9-3 and wound up
in the Holiday Bowl against the Arizona Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Cheatham; Brown, a junior rover from Scottsdale
Saguaro; and Johnson, a senior linebacker from Alhambra, it isn't a
bad consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us Arizona guys, playing the Wildcats is almost as good,''
Cheatham said.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially big for Cheatham and Johnson. Cheatham is a
second cousin to Arizona tailback Trung Canidate. And Johnson is
even closer to Canidate, having grown up in the same neighborhood
and having been a Pop Warner teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real special,'' Johnson said. ``Especially because of
Trung. We played together in the West Central Pop Warner. We both
played for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also ran track. I never got the chance to run against him,
but we used to compare our times and all that. I know his parents
real well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham, a starting wideout with 13 catches for 155 yards in
Nebraska's option attack, said he wasn't that close to Canidate as
they grew up, and he didn't know they were related until he was a
junior at South Mountain and Canidate was a sophomore at Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad and my dad are first cousins,'' Cheatham said. ``We
played against each other in high school, and he did his thing. He
scored a couple of touchdowns. But I did my thing, and we won by
two or three touchdowns. So I had those bragging rights after my
senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Arizonans have developed close ties and have leaned
upon each other while adjusting to a different lifestyle in
laid-back Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have some guys from your home state on the
squad,'' said Brown, who participated in a team-high 102 tackles
and had one interception. ``It's nice to have somebody you can
relate to. Those guys helped me adjust, and you're a little more
comfortable when you know some other guys have come here from
Arizona and made it.''
</P>
<P>
   All three also were recruited by Arizona, and Wildcats Coach
Dick Tomey winces when he thinks about how three good ones got
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great players,'' Tomey said. ``We couldn't get a visit
out of any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   All three did make unofficial visits, but none gave the Wildcats
serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really interested,'' Brown said. ``I really wanted to
get out of the state. That was one of my main objectives, and I
came to Nebraska because I think it's the best program in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham and Johnson were even more adamant. They grew up as
Arizona State fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good program, but I ended up being a Prop 48
(academically ineligible as a freshman), and I thought Nebraska had
a better support program,'' said Johnson, who is fourth in total
tackles with 70 and leads the team with six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham said he remains an ASU fan, even though the Cornhuskers
lost to the Sun Devils two seasons ago in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a UA fan,'' Cheatham said. ``I grew up as a Sun Devils
fan, and I was hoping ASU would blow them out this year. ASU will
get them next year, and we'll take care of them this week.''
</P>
<P>
   And if not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still hearing it about that ASU game (in 1996),'' Cheatham
said. ``If we lose to Arizona, I might have to move or relocate.'' &QL;

UA COACH, PLAYERS DRAW STRENGTH FROM TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In an Arizona season with 11 victories, two
quarterbacks and many angles, there is a single moment at which it
all began.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defining point,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   A tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In June, offensive line coach Charlie Dickey lost his 3-year-old
daughter. Chanel Dickey died from a cancerous tumor near the center
of her head.
</P>
<P>
   For Dickey, it was the kind of crushing blow that forces a
re-evaluation of personal priorities. He made his living in a game.
He lived as a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football didn't mean very much, not much at all,'' said
Dickey, who first learned of his daughter's inoperable tumor a year
ago. ``Suddenly, there's a different spin on what things mean in
terms of wins and losses, that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember after certain games, especially last year, of
coming home and not thinking about the game. It was just about my
daughter. Football suddenly became a very, very small scope of
things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But football also began to emerge as a powerful source of
strength. Dickey and his family began to rely on Arizona's
offensive linemen as they rallied to support him at a time of great
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they grew.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey grew beyond his grief. And Arizona's offensive line,
unknown and uncertain in September, grew into a cohesive force that
on Wednesday will face Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl at Qualcomm
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family,'' said junior Manuia Savea, a 6-foot-2, 296-pound
tackle from American Samoa. ``All of us knew about Coach Dickey's
daughter. We rallied around him. We wanted him to draw strength
from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's a reason we've played well. We've been
effective because we're together, and we're together because of
Coach Dickey.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona, Dickey's offensive line is another example of a
remarkably close, unselfish team. Tomey preaches family to the
point that it often begins to sound overblown and cliched. In the
age of Monica Lewinsky and presidential impeachment, it's just too
good to believe.
</P>
<P>
   But if the effective Keith Smith-Ortege Jenkins rotation at
quarterback is evidence, Dickey's offensive line is proof that
Tomey isn't just whistling a warm and fuzzy tune.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest test still awaits. Arizona's young line _ two
seniors, two juniors, a sophomore and a freshman _ has yet to face
a defense with the overpowering physical reputation of a Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Nebraska team has great speed and great strength,'' said
Dickey, who played at Scottsdale Saguaro High School and Scottsdale
Community College for two seasons, 1983-1984, before moving on to
Arizona. ``Against California, we had to deal with speed. But we
have never seen this kind of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is difficult. But Dickey believes his linemen can
prevail, in large part because together, they already have. Their
trust in each other was born at about the time Dickey's daughter
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gone through all of last spring's drills,'' said Dickey,
who has three other daughters and whose wife, former Arizona
basketball player Lisa Bradshaw, is expecting a son. ``My guys were
out there and working for me while I was gone. It's a great
testament to this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a whole lot of moments. When we found out about
Chanel's tumor _ God bless, she was able to live another year _
everybody just rallied around us. Again and again, the players
lifted my and my wife's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family comes together when times are a tough. My
players did that for me and my wife more times than I can even
recount. They're just kids who are as unselfish as they are tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my daughter made me think and made them
think. They know that nothing can be taken for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   For Savea, guard Yusuf Scott, center Bruce Wiggins, guard Steven
Grace, tackle Edwin Mulitalo and end Mike Lucky, the lesson has
lasted a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach lost his daughter, but he will never lose his offensive
line,'' Savea said. &QL;

TEXAS KNOWS MISSISSIPPI ST. OFFENSE NO JOKING MATTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES AND WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There is quite a bit of mutual respect between
Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese and Mississippi State
offensive guru Lynn Amedee, at least enough that Reese doesn't mind
taking a jab at the coach he'll be dueling Friday in the Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn has been around about 100 years,'' said Reese, at 55 two
years younger than Amedee. ``He was the offensive coordinator for
Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Amedee's offense is an interesting package, Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has every play and every trick play in the book,'' he said.
``They like to hammer you and make you soft in spots, but trick you
a little bit by misalignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to compete against him. It's like a chess game trying
to force him into doing something he doesn't want to do.'' \Nname:
_ Mike Jones
JOHNSON IN EXALTED COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   UT's Cedric Woodard, who Reese said will play both end and
tackle Friday, views Mississippi State running back James Johnson
as favorably comparable to the Longhorns' Heisman Trophy winner,
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gained a Southeastern Conference-high 1,383 yards
despite injury problems that limited in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great back,'' Woodard said. ``He runs hard, has good
speed. Nothing I could say bad about him. The only thing our back
has that he doesn't have is all the records. It's going to be a
challenge for us to stop him.''
BULLDOGS ON THE MOVE
</P>
<P>
   After two days of workouts on Texas Stadium's artificial turf,
Mississippi State moved to an Irving schools grass field yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the visitors to the workout was former Bulldogs and
Cowboys star D.D. Lewis, thrilled that his alma mater was making
its first trip to the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance were two of Jackie Sherrill's former Aggies:
Kevin Murray and Chet Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who quarterbacked the 1985-86 teams to Cotton Bowl
appearances, now works in Irving. Brooks, a defensive back who
played three seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, is a builder in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin looks great, like he could just step right out there and
do it all again today,'' Sherrill said. ``But Chet, he's starting
to look like me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the practice, Sherrill announced that he will hold a
reunion with his former A&AMP;M players at 3 p.m. tomorrow at the
team's hotel, the Reunion Hyatt.

 &HT;    Educators tackle tough questions on HIV/AIDS education
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Health educator Frances Wright Thomas challenges
critics of Ohio's federally funded HIV/AIDS prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not realizing that this AIDS disease is a reality.
You're playing around with a disease that is killing people every
day,'' said Thomas, supervisor of the Montgomery County Combined
Health District's AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, does talking about safer sex encourage teens to
have sex?
</P>
<P>
   Some say it does. Others, including some of those who preach
abstinence, acknowledge that some teens are sexually active and
need to hear the message of safer sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Education is weighing arguments on all
sides in the HIV education debate as the department develops a
model health and physical education program. The model is a
collection of goals students should be able to reach for each grade
level. Among those goals are learning about reproduction and ways
to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Many local school districts already include those goals in their
curriculum. The districts that don't would not be required to adopt
the state model.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue is divisive. Two weeks ago, a subcommittee of
the state board of education voted to modify the Programs that Work
training that teaches adults how to talk about preventing the
spread of HIV, the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. That action occurred after outgoing state Superintendent
John Goff imposed a moratorium on HIV/AIDS prevention training
because critics claimed it encouraged teens to have sex and was too
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   State and local educators and health officials accuse the
critics of using scare tactics and false information. Statistics
indicate that the increasing prevalence of prevention programs has
coincided with a decrease in risky sexual activity among teens.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, the percentage of students who
are sexually active has dropped below 50 percent. The teen
pregnancy rate and gonorrhea rate are declining also, while the
percentage of sexually active students who use condoms has
increased to nearly 57 percent from 46 percent since 1991,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But those positive statistics do not diminish the threat of
contracting HIV. Half of all HIV infections are contracted by
people under age 25 and HIV infection is the sixth leading cause of
death among 15- to 24-year-olds in the United States, according to
CDC statistics released in September.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ricky Boyd, director of the county health district's
division of special services and a Dayton school board member, is
convinced that local HIV prevention efforts are on the right track.
Montgomery County's program focuses on abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is the only key that we have,'' Boyd said. ``People
die for lack of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Ohio Department of Education's Programs That
Work (PTW) effort.
</P>
<P>
   Programs That Work, funded by the CDC, trains adults from
community groups, health departments and schools to talk to
teen-agers and others adults about preventing the spread of HIV.
PTW is comprised of five programs used across the United States
that have resulted in reducing sexually transmitted disease rates,
getting youth to delay the initiation of sexual activity and other
positive outcomes, said Joyce Brannan, the department of
education's consultant for HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease and
Pregnancy Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Clarence Johnson, the health district's supervisor of
minority programs, both went to the PTW training sessions. ``I
don't consider anything we went through inappropriate or
offensive,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   High school students in the Dayton, Kettering, Northmont,
Trotwood and Jefferson Twp. districts are exposed to PTW education
by health district trainers. State law requires that health classes
include instruction about venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hoffman, vice president of Right to Life of Greater
Cincinnati, believes schools are teaching ``counterfeit
abstinence'' when they should be teaching children about the
sanctity of marriage. In addition, Hoffman said, talking to
students about condoms gives them a false sense of security because
condoms can fail.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, such as Hoffman, believe the state and federal
governments are trying to usurp the authority of local school
boards and parents. They've criticized the use of slang terms and
models of sexual organs in training sessions for adult trainers.
Critics say the CDC is trying to foist explicit sex education on
states and will force Ohio to adopt a health and sex education
state proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say there is no plan to implement such a test.
But Hoffman isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy. It's just
not a theory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Irish Keaney, who criticized PTW programs during her
unsuccessful effort to unseat 4th District State School Board
member Melanie Bates of Cincinnati, said discussions of sex and
contraceptives with students make them more likely to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   She also said programs ``sold to the public under the guise of a
health concern and stopping the spread of disease'' are too
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Area educators disagreed, saying teachers will never encourage
students to have sex and the focus will always be abstinence
because it is the only sure way to avoid a sexually transmitted
disease. But because some students are already having sex, it would
be wrong to avoid talking about ways to lessen the chance of
catching a sexually transmitted disease, said Craig Williams,
Dayton's associate director of health and physical education.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and school officials from Cedarville, Xenia, Springboro
and Dayton all said parents are the schools' partners in discussing
sexuality. Parents are warned in advance of sensitive discussions
so they can ask that their children be excused if they object.
Those interviewed said such policies are typical of Ohio schools
and they could never imagine a scenario where the state would force
teachers into explicit discussions of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything districts tend to err on the side of caution,''
said Randy Overbeck, Xenia Schools' director of instructional
services.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC researcher said repeated studies have found no evidence
that informing students about sexually transmitted diseases and
contraception leads them to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV education has been increasing in this country for the past
seven years and at the same time we see some real positive trends
in delay (of sexual activity) and in condom use. It, in a sense,
counters the notion that in educating youth about HIV it will
enhance risk,'' said Janet Collins, branch chief for research in
the CDC's division of adolescent and school health.

 &HT;    Oft-delayed Delta flight is finally ready when you are
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Of all the flights to all the airports
across America, Delta's late-night hop from Atlanta to West Palm
Beach distinguished itself in the most irritating way.
</P>
<P>
   First, it made the federal Department of Transportation's List
of Shame, which ranks domestic flights that arrive late more than
80 percent of the time. It finished 1997 with the very worst
on-time record of any flight by the 10 major airlines required to
file reports.
</P>
<P>
   Then The Wall Street Journal _ factoring in crowding,
breakdowns, stomach-churning snacks and other miseries of the skies
_ pronounced it one of the 5 Worst Flights in America.
</P>
<P>
   How bad can any less-than-two-hour flight be? Especially between
two of the least-likely airports to be snowbound? Climbing aboard
was the only way to find out.
</P>
<P>
   It took a little checking to find out where and when to climb.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal noted that Delta had renumbered the flight four
times while trying to shed its reputation. A fifth change has since
occurred. Flight 284 gave way to Flight 1485 on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The takeoff time has been juggled too, from 8:55 p.m. to 10:05
p.m., allowing more time to ready the plane and allow connecting
passengers from so many spokes of Delta's hub to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   That change had already been made before the Worst Flights story
ran in July. It didn't help. The Journal reporter sat through a
two-hour repair delay (the story didn't give the date) and noted
that in the previous month, the flight was still running late 60
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Delta kept juggling, with considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst behind-time days, the flight started in Las Vegas
and went on to Salt Lake City before heading to Atlanta. Even when
it wasn't held up by delays on the previous legs, its 8:55 takeoff
time for West Palm Beach was in the thick of other departures, said
Delta spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The route changed completely in June, he said. Now the Lockheed
L-1011 flies from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta, then heads for West
Palm Beach and stays there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On-time performance has been getting better since, Kennedy said.
Department of Transportation statistics back up his claim.
</P>
<P>
   In three months leading up to the latest reporting date of Oct.
31, the flight actually arrived in West Palm Beach a minute early,
on average. It was more than 15 minutes late just 7 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics, of course, don't mean a thing when you're nodding
off on a lumpy pile of luggage at the airport gate. A true test of
the renumbered, reborn Flight 1485 could only be conducted midweek
in holiday season from a blue-cloth seat in coach.
</P>
<P>
   The plane taxied up to Hartsfield Airport's gate A21 well before
9 p.m. The mostly somnambulant passengers were aboard and belted,
their gift-wrapped packages stowed, as departure time came and
went.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably noticed it's past time to be pushed away,''
the captain finally announced. Delta 1485 was ready to go, but
another plane had trouble on the runway and was being towed back
for repair.
</P>
<P>
   More time passed as 1485 took its place in line: more than 45
minutes in all before it was finally up and away at 10:52. No
drinks or snacks were served during the wait; a flight attendant
explained they were locked in the galley.
</P>
<P>
   The wait might have seemed worse if the flight were full, but it
wasn't nearly. There were just two or three passengers in most of
the five-across middle rows and plenty of solo passengers in the
double seats along the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Once aloft, the trip was smooth and swift. Everyone was offered
headphones for music, a sack of pretzels and nuts, plus a choice of
soft drinks. It was hardly luxurious, but no great imposition for a
flight that lasted little longer that Orville Wright's.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one secret of 1485's on-time performance: It was
scheduled for an hour and 43 minutes, but it took just an hour and
12. The padding is purposeful, Kennedy said. Atlanta is the
second-busiest airport in the country and that means routine
takeoff delays.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the late takeoff, it arrived just 16 minutes late _
one more than the 15-minute limit used to determine on-time
performance. But that won't hurt the record much: 1485 was running
better than 80 percent on time for the month, a near-reversal of
its shameful days, according to Delta.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, it's hardly a contender for anyone's list of
annoying flights _ unlike U.S. Airways Flight 255 from Atlanta to
Philadelphia, the current shame-list leader. That one's running
late 80.77 percent of the time with an average delay of 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Or United's 320 from Chicago to West Palm Beach. The
July-October records show it with the longest delays of any flight
landing here. It was late exactly half the time, averaging 29.5
minutes beyond the scheduled 12:28 arrival time.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a much better bet than any flight from Atlanta for a
snow delay.

 &HT;    The ultimate compliment: The security of having parents
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Absolutely no one cares that I have two ugly,
twisted arthritic fingers on my right hand, or that my most
interesting body parts have
</P>
<P>
   succumbed to gravity. When I wail because the government is
sending me Medicare forms, it's a solo. And who's there to cheer me
up every morning when I
</P>
<P>
   look in the bathroom mirror? Certainly not that rutted map that
stares back at me.
</P>
<P>
   After much soul searching, I've finally figured out what's
really good about these years some nitwit has labeled the
``golden'' ones. It's the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Where would I rather be? Particularly if the south of France is
not an option? I've decided that for now, it's right here having
the chance to enjoy the adult my son has become.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend we were deep into one of our semi-philosophical
discussions of
</P>
<P>
   life, love, and why our checkout line is always the slowest,
when he asked, ``You know what's really good about us, Mom? We
don't get all bent out of shape over little stuff that doesn't
amount to a hill of beans. Like a couple of weeks ago when the
Pepsi truck chewed up the back end of your Bronco. No hysterics. No
histrionics. Just a simple, `Are you okay?' before we got on with
it.'' He's right. We learned a lot about each other that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor says he learned that I hadn't been blowing smoke all
those years when I preached that material stuff wasn't terribly
important and that what really mattered was character, love, and
honesty. And when he expressed his concern for the guy driving the
truck, I knew my son had become the man I'd hoped he would. ``He
just screwed up, Mom,'' he said sadly, ``and now he's worried about
his job.'' Later, when the police were finished at the scene, I was
proud when he shook the driver's hand and told him he hoped it
would be OK for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive home, when I commended him for his values and his
ability to deal with unfamiliar and unpleasant situations,
Kristofor flatly stated, ``I learned it all from you and Dad. You
guys were never negative with me and you encouraged me to try new
things and trust myself. My whole life has been like my first trip
to the ocean. Remember?''
</P>
<P>
   How could I forget? He was only a year old, but he'd often heard
the story of his first encounter with the biggest bathtub he'd ever
seen. As we rounded the corner of the rented beach house, he
spotted the ocean, wrenched his hand from
</P>
<P>
   mine, and raced to the edge of the water, hesitating only a
moment before diving in - clothes and all. His dad was right behind
him. Later we marveled that he hadn't been afraid, that he'd gone
in laughing and came out sputtering, but still laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my point, Mom,'' he explains. ``I knew I had backup. I
knew my folks were there. That attitude carries over and gives a
kid security and independence. Because I could trust you and Dad, I
learned to trust myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the woods around our house when I was growing up. I
don't remember
</P>
<P>
   Dad ever taking me out there and telling me where to go and
where not to go; I
</P>
<P>
   just remember venturing out a little further each time. It was
no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and Dad encouraged me to be curious about everything
around me. I was
</P>
<P>
   happy pulling over rocks and looking at the critters under them,
investigating
</P>
<P>
   plants and stuff. Heck, I still enjoy that. `Life is in the
details,' you said, and that's true. There is so much pleasure to
be had in the little stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember saying those things, but I never thought he was
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when I was six or seven, way too young to be messing
with Dad's
</P>
<P>
   old army surplus bayonet? You let me roam the woods with it as
long as I promised to follow Dad's rules and keep it in its sleeve
except when I was using it for important stuff like digging
trenches or saving Georgia's forests from kudzu
</P>
<P>
   (the insidious vine brought from the Orient to shore up railroad
embankments
</P>
<P>
   that now poses a bigger threat to the south than the traffic on
Atlanta's downtown connector).
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and I used to dam the creek and then play Godzilla,
crushing it and watching the flood from a high place. And all of
those books you and Dad gave me - the science stuff? Naturally, I
tromped the woods looking for tigers and bears, but when I'd see
only squirrels and chipmunks, I'd still run back to pull a book off
the shelf and read about what I'd seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and Dad were my security and home was my haven. I never
had to carry a
</P>
<P>
   key and be alone. Whether it sounded like it or not, I really
appreciated having parents. It was the ultimate security.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as I'm concerned, that's the ultimate compliment.
Guess I'll quit
</P>
<P>
   griping.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Misuse of fertility drugs a factor in multiple
births
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved from Cox News
Service in the past week.)
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Using fertility drugs is expensive and
time-consuming. It can lead to painful frustration and unsettling
intrusion in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to carry the risk of delivering a litter of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The recent births of eight babies in Houston, Texas has drawn
criticism from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and
the New York Times editorial page, which decried its inherent
health danger and expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to, I could have had patients with octuplets,''
says Dr. Mark Bidwell, the reproductive endocrinologist who directs
Reproductive Medicine at Kettering Medical Center. ``But I don't
think any responsible infertility specialist would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If a properly trained physician adequately monitors a woman's
response to fertility drugs, the doctor can tell when conditions
are ripe for a multiple pregnancy and take steps to avoid it,
Bidwell says. In order to avoid it, the patient must agree to stop
a treatment course that costs about $3,000 and results in
successful pregnancies only about once in every five attempts. And
most people's health plans don't cover the treatment. Also, doctors
and administrators realize they compete with other specialists on
the basis of their pregnancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that doctors who administer fertility drugs
don't always recognize the warning signs of multiple conceptions,
Bidwell says. He and other sub-specialists have learned how to
identify women who are especially sensitive to the potent
injectable drugs. The 27-year-old Houston mother's sensitivity
became clear when she miscarried triplets earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should have been a tremendous red flag,'' Bidwell says.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative but even more expensive technique is in vitro
fertilization, in which eggs are fertilized outside the woman's
body. Its advantage, says Bidwell, is the doctor can control the
number of embryos that are created and implanted in the woman's
uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are never any 100 percent guarantees,'' he says. And
about one-third of women who become pregnant under fertility
treatments give birth to more than one child. One-quarter of them
will deliver twins, and virtually all of the other 8 percent will
have triplets, but even most specialists will have occasional
patients with quadruplets or quintuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that,'' says Bidwell, ``happens once or twice in an entire
career.'
</P>
<P>
   Resolve to add fruits and veggies to diet
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After weeks of family celebrations, office parties and
nonstop socializing, a lot of folks are feeling as stuffed as a
Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, all that revelry will give way to resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, many will resolve to diet _ whether it's to
lose the 5 pounds gained over the holidays or the 20 pounds put on
over the last year. Or maybe it's simply a desire to eat and feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the reason _ or the particular diet philosophy you
plan to follow _ there's one goal that's good for everyone: Eat
more fruits and vegetables. Shoot for five servings a day at the
least _ the more the better. And most of us can stand to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, less than 25 percent are meeting the minimum
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks are counting french fried potatoes _ the most popular
vegetable dish consumed in America, and a fat-rich nutritional
disaster _ as one of their servings, according to Chris Rosenbloom,
a nutritionist and professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence indicates that phytochemical and antioxidant
nutrients found in fruits and veggies protect human tissue from the
kind of toxic damage that occurs with everyday living. That means
diets rich in such foods may actually help prevent some cancers and
heart damage in addition to helping to lower cholesterol,
protecting vision and regulating blood pressure and blood sugar
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium are phytochemicals. So are
beta carotene and carotenoids, found in such foods as carrots,
sweet potatoes and red peppers. Carotenoids are believed to be
defenders against lung cancer, heart disease and cataracts. Lutein
and zeaxanthin also help protect vision and are found in kale,
collard greens, broccoli, spinach and tangerines.
</P>
<P>
   Lycopene may help prevent some cancers, especially prostate and
cervical cancers. Tomatoes are a great source, along with
grapefruit, raspberries, strawberries and watermelon. Saponins,
found in garlic, dried beans and asparagus, may help protect
against high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few examples of the kinds of nutrients
scientists have identified in fruits and vegetables that are
proving to be powerful agents of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research began to show that people in cultures with low rates
in cancer and heart disease ate a lot of fruits and veggies,''
Rosenbloom said. ``From there, research began to focus on what
exactly in those foods might be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating well shouldn't have to be hard
</P>
<P>
   It's not as hard as one might think to get a serving of fruits
or vegetables. All it takes is a half-cup of cooked vegetables or
fruits; three-quarters of a cup of juice; 1 cup of raw leafy
greens, such as lettuce or 1 medium-size piece of fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3-5 spears of broccoli
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7-8 baby carrots or carrot sticks
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 ear of corn
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 spears of asparagus
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium stewed or fresh tomato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium baked potato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4-5 dark green lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Five a day the easy way
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Serve a variety of fresh, frozen and canned fruits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep fruit handy. Carry a piece in your purse or briefcase.
Create a community fruit bowl at work. At home, keep a fruit bowl
near the family's spot for watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cut up raw fruits and veggies and keep healthy dips in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep dried fruits, such as raisins, apples or apricots in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drink 100 percent fruit juices more often.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start early. Breakfast is a great time to work in two servings
of fruit _ try fresh fruit with cereal and a glass of juice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make salads healthier with dark greens such as spinach. Feel
free to use the salads in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add frozen vegetable mixes to rice, pasta or broth for a quick
meal.

 &HT;    Sowing seeds of success
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Post-holiday letdown gives a lot of people the blahs. But it can
also be a breather and a time to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have some time off this week, or at least a slack
period at work. Most of us have been partying, spending and
generally going at warp speed for weeks now. And almost all of us
suffer from nagging suspicions that things have gotten complicated,
expensive and a little bit out of control.
</P>
<P>
   One way to recover is to try to get a grip on your financial
life. With a little organization and effort, you can begin to
recoup some feeling of control over your financial life.
</P>
<P>
   Think of these 10 steps as fairly concrete ways to get your
financial act together, shed bad habits and start building good
ones.
</P>
<P>
   1. Establish some goals
</P>
<P>
   Set aside an hour _ with spouse or significant other _ to figure
out where you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jot down all the achievements you can think of. For example, you
might write down the amount you want to save or invest for major
expenses _ a big vacation, a new home, even retirement. Paying off
the holiday debts on your credit cards might be another big item
right now. The important thing is to get them all together and sort
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have your list, go through it again and rank them, from
most important to least. Then try to estimate how much each will
cost, and when you will need the money.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can begin to balance your aspirations to your means. If
you're saving a lot for a home down payment, for example, you may
have to keep retirement saving to a minimum for the time being. Bad
idea, but maybe necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Your goals may start with some or all of the next nine steps. If
all of this is overwhelming, then pick the one, two or three you
can really benefit from.
</P>
<P>
   But keep your feet on the ground:
</P>
<P>
   _ Set reasonable goals. Maybe you can divert $38.50 from each
week's paycheck, so you'll have a filled-up individual retirement
account at the end of the year. If that's too much, a reasonable
goal may to be to save $10 a week and leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be specific. ``I'm going to start saving'' is a pretty
sentiment. ``I'm going to save $10 a week'' is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay positive. You want goals to work toward, not bad habits
to avoid. The point is to achieve, not to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get organized
</P>
<P>
   Nothing promotes confusion as much as jumbled or mislaid
records. If that's your problem, here is your solution:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gather up all your important financial and legal documents.
This includes insurance policies, bank statements, investment
records, deeds and mortgage records, wills, maybe even medical
records. And don't forget tax documents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a filing system for records that keep growing, such
as health insurance claims and tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide where you will keep each record. Some records _ such as
appraisals of your valuables, stock certificates and deeds _ need
to go to a safe deposit box at the bank. Consider keeping a
fire-proof box at home for documents difficult or impossible to
replace. Those might include wills, passports and insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a list of all those documents and where you put them.
Make sure your executor or some other responsible party has a copy
of the list.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pay off your consumer debts
</P>
<P>
   Paying high interest rates on credit cards is a waste of money.
Come up with a schedule for paying all your bills, not just paying
the minimums. Otherwise, you have converted your wallet into an
income stream for the lender.
</P>
<P>
   Often you can expedite the process by finding lower interest
credit cards. On the Internet, check out http://www.bankrate.com or
http://www.cardtrak.com for credit cards that will give you a lower
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   4. Review your checkbook
</P>
<P>
   This is a rough-and-ready substitute for a budget. Along with
your checkbook, review the charges on your credit cards for the
last three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   You are fishing for unpleasant surprises _ an unexpected amount
of money spent on restaurants or at fancy retailers, for example.
With luck, you'll spot some areas where you're willing to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Review your investments
</P>
<P>
   Once a year, every investor ought to sort through the stocks,
mutual funds and other investments in his or her portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As you look at each one, ask yourself: Would I buy more shares
today? Do I think this holding has more growing room? Is it selling
at a plausible price, compared to its earnings and compared to
similar investments?
</P>
<P>
   You may find some investments you want to sell. You may find a
few you would unload if the market gets scary again. Or you may
choose to hold on _ but with a much better understanding of what
you own, and why.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an asset allocation plan, you should check whether
you are still close to your chosen limits. Let's say you intend to
hold 50 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds and 25 percent cash. The
market's growth in recent years could have greatly increased the
percentage you have in stocks. You may want to shift some holdings
around, selling appreciated stock and putting the money into bonds
or money markets.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to include holdings in 401(k)s or other retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   6. Tune up your savings program
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, 56 percent of Americans said they could
afford to save $20 a week. The chart shows how much money you would
save by investing that small amount over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't do it by yourself, the best thing may be an
automatic savings plan. It's easy enough: Ask your bank or a mutual
fund company to set up an automatic transfer from your checking
account to a savings account. If you work for a large company, you
may be able have a payroll deduction made to a credit union. The
principle is if you don't see it, you won't spend it.
</P>
<P>
   7. Put money in your
</P>
<P>
   retirement plans
</P>
<P>
   Average people have a hard time coming by tax breaks these days.
Among the remaining ones are individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   You may get upfront tax deductions, and you will get
tax-deferred earnings on investments in those plans. In a 401(k),
employers often make matching donations _ free money.
</P>
<P>
   8. Review your insurance
</P>
<P>
   If you have gone through one of life's big events, such as
marriage or the birth of a child, you need to re-examine your life
insurance needs.
</P>
<P>
   Your property insurance may need a review, too. Is the coverage
still adequate? Could you lower your cost, perhaps by raising
deductibles? Did Santa bring you jewelry, an expenive camera or
other goodies that might require special-purpose policies?
</P>
<P>
   The problem with insurance is the field is full of variegated
products, eager salespeople and confusion. A good book to help
clear the confusion is Janet Bamford's ``Smarter Insurance
Solutions.'' It costs $19.95. You can order it by calling
1-800-233-4830.
</P>
<P>
   9. Keep on learning
</P>
<P>
   Rresources for personal finance information are innumerable,
including this and other newspapers, an array of magazines and many
books. The old reliable among all-purpose financial planning books
is Jane Bryant Quinn's ``Making the Most of Your Money.'' For
investing, take a look at ``Stocks for the Long Run'' by Jeremy J.
Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   On the Net, you can find advice and good links at
http://www.moneycentral
</P>
<P>
   .com, http://www.quicken.com, and http://www.investorama.com.
</P>
<P>
   10. Review your will
</P>
<P>
   You need to make sure it reflects major changes in your life,
such as births or divorce. Is your executor still available to
handle your estate?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's a good idea to prepare a list of
beneficiaries and their addresses. Leave a copy with your will.
</P>
<P>
   One more step: Consider executing a power of attorney for health
care and a living will. Those documents become important if you are
no longer able to make decisions for yourself.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Misuse of fertility drugs a factor in multiple
births
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved from Cox News
Service in the past week.)
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Using fertility drugs is expensive and
time-consuming. It can lead to painful frustration and unsettling
intrusion in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to carry the risk of delivering a litter of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The recent births of eight babies in Houston, Texas has drawn
criticism from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and
the New York Times editorial page, which decried its inherent
health danger and expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to, I could have had patients with octuplets,''
says Dr. Mark Bidwell, the reproductive endocrinologist who directs
Reproductive Medicine at Kettering Medical Center. ``But I don't
think any responsible infertility specialist would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If a properly trained physician adequately monitors a woman's
response to fertility drugs, the doctor can tell when conditions
are ripe for a multiple pregnancy and take steps to avoid it,
Bidwell says. In order to avoid it, the patient must agree to stop
a treatment course that costs about $3,000 and results in
successful pregnancies only about once in every five attempts. And
most people's health plans don't cover the treatment. Also, doctors
and administrators realize they compete with other specialists on
the basis of their pregnancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that doctors who administer fertility drugs
don't always recognize the warning signs of multiple conceptions,
Bidwell says. He and other sub-specialists have learned how to
identify women who are especially sensitive to the potent
injectable drugs. The 27-year-old Houston mother's sensitivity
became clear when she miscarried triplets earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should have been a tremendous red flag,'' Bidwell says.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative but even more expensive technique is in vitro
fertilization, in which eggs are fertilized outside the woman's
body. Its advantage, says Bidwell, is the doctor can control the
number of embryos that are created and implanted in the woman's
uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are never any 100 percent guarantees,'' he says. And
about one-third of women who become pregnant under fertility
treatments give birth to more than one child. One-quarter of them
will deliver twins, and virtually all of the other 8 percent will
have triplets, but even most specialists will have occasional
patients with quadruplets or quintuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that,'' says Bidwell, ``happens once or twice in an entire
career.'
</P>
<P>
   Resolve to add fruits and veggies to diet
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After weeks of family celebrations, office parties and
nonstop socializing, a lot of folks are feeling as stuffed as a
Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, all that revelry will give way to resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, many will resolve to diet _ whether it's to
lose the 5 pounds gained over the holidays or the 20 pounds put on
over the last year. Or maybe it's simply a desire to eat and feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the reason _ or the particular diet philosophy you
plan to follow _ there's one goal that's good for everyone: Eat
more fruits and vegetables. Shoot for five servings a day at the
least _ the more the better. And most of us can stand to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, less than 25 percent are meeting the minimum
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks are counting french fried potatoes _ the most popular
vegetable dish consumed in America, and a fat-rich nutritional
disaster _ as one of their servings, according to Chris Rosenbloom,
a nutritionist and professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence indicates that phytochemical and antioxidant
nutrients found in fruits and veggies protect human tissue from the
kind of toxic damage that occurs with everyday living. That means
diets rich in such foods may actually help prevent some cancers and
heart damage in addition to helping to lower cholesterol,
protecting vision and regulating blood pressure and blood sugar
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium are phytochemicals. So are
beta carotene and carotenoids, found in such foods as carrots,
sweet potatoes and red peppers. Carotenoids are believed to be
defenders against lung cancer, heart disease and cataracts. Lutein
and zeaxanthin also help protect vision and are found in kale,
collard greens, broccoli, spinach and tangerines.
</P>
<P>
   Lycopene may help prevent some cancers, especially prostate and
cervical cancers. Tomatoes are a great source, along with
grapefruit, raspberries, strawberries and watermelon. Saponins,
found in garlic, dried beans and asparagus, may help protect
against high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few examples of the kinds of nutrients
scientists have identified in fruits and vegetables that are
proving to be powerful agents of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research began to show that people in cultures with low rates
in cancer and heart disease ate a lot of fruits and veggies,''
Rosenbloom said. ``From there, research began to focus on what
exactly in those foods might be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating well shouldn't have to be hard
</P>
<P>
   It's not as hard as one might think to get a serving of fruits
or vegetables. All it takes is a half-cup of cooked vegetables or
fruits; three-quarters of a cup of juice; 1 cup of raw leafy
greens, such as lettuce or 1 medium-size piece of fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3-5 spears of broccoli
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7-8 baby carrots or carrot sticks
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 ear of corn
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 spears of asparagus
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium stewed or fresh tomato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium baked potato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4-5 dark green lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Five a day the easy way
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Serve a variety of fresh, frozen and canned fruits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep fruit handy. Carry a piece in your purse or briefcase.
Create a community fruit bowl at work. At home, keep a fruit bowl
near the family's spot for watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cut up raw fruits and veggies and keep healthy dips in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep dried fruits, such as raisins, apples or apricots in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drink 100 percent fruit juices more often.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start early. Breakfast is a great time to work in two servings
of fruit _ try fresh fruit with cereal and a glass of juice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make salads healthier with dark greens such as spinach. Feel
free to use the salads in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add frozen vegetable mixes to rice, pasta or broth for a quick
meal.

 &HT;    Who is Tavis Smiley, and why are so many black Americans
listening to him?
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tavis Smiley loves to talk. And talk.
And talk. And talk.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Smiley enjoy speaking, he relishes doing it
quickly, as if he gets paid by the syllable. If that were true,
Smiley would have a bank account even Bill Gates would envy. His
words come so fast and furious that listeners need to take a
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a very precocious, people-loving kid. I've
always enjoyed running my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets paid _ reportedly more than $1 million a year _ to
run it. Smiley, 34, is the host of Black Entertainment Television's
BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley, a live, call-in talk show in The
Larry King Live mold. The 3-year-old show covers current events,
celebrities, politicians and hot-button issues pertaining to
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   BET Tonight is also known for boasting one of TV's most eclectic
guest mixes. One night, President Clinton is discussing his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The next, the Artist (formerly
known as Prince) is talking about his recording career. The night
after that it's Lino Graglia, a University of Texas professor who
believes African-Americans and Hispanics can't learn on the same
level as whites.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the topic, black viewers are listening. Smiley, who was
selected in 1994 by Time as one of America's 50 most promising
young leaders under 40, is quickly becoming an important voice
among black Americans. He has, for instance, urged blacks to vote,
publicly blasted a national advertising firm over a racist memo and
successfully campaigned to bring Fox's Living Single back on the
air after it was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up poor is the main reason Smiley often uses BET Tonight
to inspire and empower others. ``I've learned that one can arguably
have a greater impact from the outside than from the inside,'' he
explains. ``The media can have such a vast influence on people vs.
elected officials who represent relatively small constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Smiley interviewed President Clinton, who at the
time was making his first public comments after the grand jury
testimony. The interview was an obvious coup for Smiley _ and BET _
since every major news organization was clamoring for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Smiley, who has been referred to as the black Ralph Nader
for justice, is more than just a talk-show host. He's a popular
twice-a-week radio commentator on The Tom Joyner Morning Show. He's
often a guest commentator on CNN, CNBC, Today and World News
Tonight with Peter Jennings. He's an author who's written three
political commentary books and a lecturer who commands hefty
speaking engagement fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tavis has a good blend of the new generation and the old,''
notes Ed Gordon, a former BET news anchor who now hosts MSNBC's
Newsfront. ``He understands his history and understands the people
that came before him. Yet he has the sensibilities of his
generation, which makes him more outspoken in all areas. He's not
afraid to stir things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Tang, BET Tonight's executive producer, is more direct.
``Tavis Smiley is a young old man.''
</P>
<P>
   That young old man lives by what he calls the three E's:
enlighten, encourage, empower.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to bed, I want to feel that something I did that
day, be it as a lecturer, talk-show host or radio commentator, hit
those E's,'' says the Indiana native.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley certainly did that earlier this year, when he got wind
that Christie's, the famous New York auction house, was auctioning
three reward posters for runaway slaves. What bothered Smiley was
that Christie's has a steadfast policy of not selling
Holocaust-related memorabilia. Those are often donated to museums.
So, Smiley used his Tom Joyner Morning Show segment to implore
Joyner's listeners to call Christie's and voice their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what they did. In less than two hours, Christie's
called Smiley, practically begging him to tell his irate listeners
to stop calling. The president of Christie's even appeared on
Joyner's show to apologize and explain the auction house's
position. The items, by the way, were later donated to museums.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley takes his activist role seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a chance to talk to more African-Americans than anybody
else in this country on a daily basis,'' says Smiley, noting that
55million viewers watch BET and roughly 5 million people listen to
Joyner's show in 95 markets. ``That's what I call reach. I try not
to be high-minded or egotistical, but that's an awesome
responsibility. People are listening to what you're saying, and
they're acting on what you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially women. When Joyner's syndicated show hits the road,
the still single, boyishly handsome Smiley has been mobbed by
screaming female fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black women are looking for someone to be our hero and for
someone to carry our cause because we know our cause has not been
completed,'' says Denise Pines, owner of Pines One Publications, a
Los Angeles-based publishing house that published two of Smiley's
books. ``He's young and attractive ... (and) he's saying what we
want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley almost never said what he had to say on BET. In fact,
when Robert L. Johnson, BET's CEO and chairman, was thinking of
launching a new late-night talk show, Smiley wasn't interested. He
wasn't even that impressed with BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``BET had taken some hits and deservedly so for not doing enough
creative programming,'' notes Smiley, known as an obsessed
perfectionist who watches tapes of his show every night. Indeed,
despite being on the air since 1980, BET remains mostly known for
airing music videos, old sitcoms and ho-hum infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't certain if BET was the place where I wanted to be,''
Smiley admits.
</P>
<P>
   But BET eventually wore him down. ``We showed him that it was a
show he could own,'' says BET Tonight producer Tang. ``When we told
Tavis that he would get a chance to stamp it with his name,
impression and personality, that made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang says Smiley does have one slight problem: He talks as fast
as Walter Winchell on speed. ``He really tries to talk slower,''
says Pines, laughing. ``But he has so much to say in such a short
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   His time with BET, however, has not always been pleasant. Even
Smiley says that his most recent contract negotiations were
``rough.'' He said he wanted three things: more money; to shoot the
show part-time in L.A.; and a stronger presence on BET.
</P>
<P>
   He got all three.
</P>
<P>
   But his major gripe was with what he felt was BET's refusal to
promote his program. ``I've worked pretty hard to make this show
the signature show on BET, and I thought the network needed to do
more to promote that fact,'' he says. ``Here I am doing the best I
can, and nobody knows I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gordon, who hosted BET's Lead Story before jumping to MSNBC,
says Smiley's complaints sound familiar. ``Tavis is fighting the
same battle I did, that the program is there, and it's viable,''
says Gordon. ``If BET wants to be MTV for us (black people), that's
great. Then someone should start up our CNN or MSNBC. I understand
his frustration.'' Smiley never thought he'd end up in
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in tiny Kokomo, Ind., young Smiley wasn't quite sure
where his life was headed. Then, in 1978, when he was 13, he met
Birch Bayh, Indiana's liberal senator, who paid a visit to his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the awesome power that elected officials had to move
people and to get things done,'' he recalls. ``I got to become a
small part of his world, and when I got to meet him, I was moved by
his charisma and style. So I began reading up on this Birch Bayh,
and that's when the political bug really bit me.''
</P>
<P>
   It bit Smiley hard. Growing up as one of 10 kids in a cramped
trailer (he slept on a mattress on the floor), he was no stranger
to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty was like my first cousin,'' says Smiley, who still
sleeps on a mattress on the floor in his Los Angeles townhome. ``So
I really wanted to do something to help people who were in the same
disenfranchised position.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley enrolled in Indiana University, where he did an
internship with then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. He graduated in
1987 with a degree in political science. After moving to Los
Angeles, Smiley, with Bradley's support, ran for city council. He
lost, but got name recognition. Bradley asked him to join his staff
as an administrative aide. It was the late mayor who taught Smiley
his first political lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me to be more concerned about getting things done
around the conference table than taking credit for it at a press
conference,'' he remembers. ``He was a quiet giant. ... Long before
Nike came up with `Just do it,' that was Tom Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley, a card-carrying liberal, makes no attempt to hide his
love for politics. He signs only one-year contracts because he
doesn't want to plan his life too far ahead. One-year deals also
give him more flexibility to, say, toss his hat into the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a public servant is such a noble profession,'' he says,
almost lovingly. ``We've managed to screw that up, and, as such,
many Americans are cynical about the process, but when approached
in the right spirit, it can yield great benefits to masses of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Smiley's followers expect him to seek _ and probably win _
an elected office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a senator in his late 40s,'' says publisher Pines,
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Smiley say?
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is not going to be unfulfilled or incomplete when I'm
no longer in broadcasting,'' he says. ``This wasn't my first love,
and it's still not my first love. My first love is still
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And his second?
</P>
<P>
   Talking, of course.

 &HT;    Act as a human pinball or create own roller coaster at
DisneyQuest
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Tired of playing with that talking Furby
already?
</P>
<P>
   Check out another fur ball's first big venture into high-tech
entertainment: DisneyQuest, a five-story, 100,000-square-foot mall
of interactive games.
</P>
<P>
   When Mickey Mouse builds a family fun center, he doesn't line
video games in a narrow room and hire a surly guy named Chuck to
yell at kids every time the change machine breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   DisneyQuest is not your father's video game ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Here, your cutting-edge choices include a virtual reality
Aladdin Magic Carpet ``ride'' or Buzz Lightyear's AstroBlaster
bumper cars that fire foam cannonballs. You can paddle your way
along the virtual Jungle Cruise or design a roller coaster and
``ride'' the computer-generated simulation.
</P>
<P>
   DisneyQuest, part of the Downtown Disney West Side entertainment
complex, opened this summer with up to 30 more worldwide locations
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's patented escape into another world begins when you
enter DisneyQuest's first-floor rotunda. You don't ride an
elevator, you ride an out-of-control ``Cybrolator'' operated by the
ghostly image of Aladdin's Genie of the Lamp. You are delivered to
Ventureport, the crossroads that leads to four entertainment zones
on four floors: Explore, Score, Create or Replay.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, players bought units to play the games, instead
of a single admission. That confusing system was changed to a one
price plays all _ $25 for 10 and up, $20 for kids 3 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest accomplishment at DisneyQuest is that it's an
interactive middle ground for everybody from techno-wizards to
techno-phobes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam, you spend about three minutes
on a bouncing pad with handlebars as you become a pinball on a huge
screen above the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hercules in the Underworld game, a team of four picks a
character for the 3-D chariot journey as you help Hercules rescue
victims of Hades.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular ``adventure,'' based on lines of teenagers, is
Create Zone's CyberSpace Mountain. You design a roller coaster on a
computer and then climb into a 360-degree pitch-and-roll simulator
to ride what you ``built.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Create Zone, you can take a 20-minute animation class and
take home your art work and a diploma. You can make stickers with
your own photo. Sid's Create-A-Toy is a computer that lets you
design a weird toy, and for $10 more you can have an
assemble-at-home kit of your creation.
</P>
<P>
   You can do a bizarre makeover of your face at Magic Mirror or
``paint'' a picture using elements from Disney animation at Living
Easel. If you fall in love with what you made at Magic Mirror or
Living Easel, you can buy a printout ($7 or $5).
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't cost anything to watch marriages erupt as couples
scream at each other in frustration playing Treasure of the Incas.
</P>
<P>
   The driver mans the steering wheel and gas pedal at a video
screen and moves the truck through a maze that's under a glass
floor. The driver's partner can follow the truck's movements and
shout directions to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no. I said LEFT! NO! LEFT! Oh, jeez,'' is how it
frequently goes as 10 couples can play at once.
</P>
<P>
   For food, there are two stops run by the Southern
California-based Cheesecake Factory Express. On the fourth floor is
the Wonderland Cafe, where you find coffees ($1.65 to $3.70),
cheesecakes ($4.75 to $5.25) and other desserts, most under $4. At
the Cafe, you can cruise the Internet, send a cyber postcard or
record your visit with DisneyQuest's Eternal Journal, which
includes your photo.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor is FoodQuest. The full menu includes soups
($2.95 to $5.50), pizza (under $4 a slice), pasta (under $7), hot
and cold wrap sandwiches (under $7) plus salads, burgers and more.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rare Disney attraction that can't handle a big
crowd. Admission is stopped at around 1,300 people to make sure
there's no more than a 12-minute wait for the major interactive
``adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   DisneyQuest is at Orlando's Downtown Disney West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Hours: 10:30 a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday, and 10:30
a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Internet: www.disneyquest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $25 for adults, $20 for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Children under 10 must be accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a sweatshirt. DisneyQuest is cold to keep the computers
humming.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call: 1-407-828-4600.

 &HT;    Ailing drummer receives gift of music
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a magical night for a man and his music
and his memories.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened Sunday because of a genuine friendship that
blossomed after Joe Collier met Edith Ellis 17 years ago, when he
was playing drums in a Dayton night club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my man, music touches the soul in so many ways,'' said
Collier, who is on oxygen and is fighting pulmonary fibrosis, a
serious lung disease. ``Music is the medicine that gets you right
over the tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier, 77, remembers the night he met Ellis, who will
celebrate her 82nd birthday Wednesday. ``We were at the old
Limerick's club and she was so kind and sweet and appreciated the
music so much,'' he said. ``She worked for a Realtor at the time,
and musicians had a tough time making ends meet, so I later went to
her office and asked if she knew where I could get some part-time
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who had lost her husband of 40 years, said she was
impressed with Collier and his gentle personality. ``I hired him
right then to be a handyman around my home,'' she said. ``When he
came here all those years ago, I told him he would always have a
roof over his head as long as he lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Collier took care of Ellis' home, her cars,
her lawn. On weekends, he would play at different musical gigs, and
often she would go with him.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, had lost his wife in death, and they formed a
friendship by helping each other.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Collier had a career that included stints
with the Count Basie band and Dizzy Gillespie. When he rattles off
some of America's music legends, they are the names of people he
knew and worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Lena Horne gave him his first big break, he said. She
heard him play drums when she was appearing at a USO show during
the war. ``When I got out of the Air Force she hired me with her
band. I spent about a year travelling with her. I met some of the
greats. Man, that was the beginning of a beautiful musical career
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier kept at it until 1958, when he tired of the road and
returned to Dayton, where he'd made his home after the war. The
music almost stopped last year at this time. Collier had always
been a smoker, and the lung damage became so severe he could hardly
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Joe made it, he pulled through,'' Ellis said. ``He had
always been such a good friend and a God-send to me, and now I knew
that it was my turn to take care of him. He had his room in my
home, and I took it upon myself to be there for him. My grandmother
always told me that if you live by the golden rule, and help
others, that good things will come back to you 10 fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Collier is on the oxygen 24 hours a day, takes medicine, and
has a home health care attendant help him with his daily bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I spend the day in the chair, watching the
television, or sitting and thinking about the wonderful days and
the musical memories,'' he said. ``Sometimes I sit and stare at my
drums.''
</P>
<P>
   The drums are set up in a corner of the music room in the home,
across from the white baby grand piano. Sunday night the room came
to life.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of piano player Richard Bright, who is 74 and a
long-time friend of Collier, Ellis invited a group of Collier's
friends to their home for a jam session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be good for Joe. He misses the music,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bright, the musicians included drummer Red
Ashley, 74, guitar player Jimmy Thompson, 75, and bass player Eddie
Brookshire, 57; Raymond Herring, 72, who plays alto saxophone, was
there with his wife, Eleanor, who plays the piano; Bill Farrell,
67, was standing by to play drums and Pete Smith, 73, was ready to
join in with his trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe settled back in his chair, the impromptu jazz session
began. It was a warm, feel-good time that made you want to clap
your hands and tap your feet and smile.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, when the band stopped for a short break, Collier
stood up, and with help from friends, moved to the corner where the
drums stood, and maneuvered himself into position. As the music
began, he moved the sticks, slowly at first, then gaining momentum,
he broke into a drum solo, working like he did decades ago with
Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   When he wound down, those in the room cheered and applauded, and
Joe Collier offered up a smile and a knowing nod of the head.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, still gasping to breathe comfortably, he said
being at his drums again was indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't put it into words. It just got through to me. I felt
it.'' he said. ``For a few moments there, it was like the old days
when I was free to let go and feel the passion that a young body
can put into the music. For a time there I was young again. I've
got to thank Edith for this night. For this gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the session, Ellis stood on the circular drive
in front of her home as the happy sound of Dixieland music warmed
the air of a cold winter night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good night for Joe, and for me,'' she said.
``The Lord has been good to me. I thank him for bringing Joe into
my life. Most of my friends are gone. Look at all the people I
would never have known if it were not for Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look at all the music I would have missed.
</P>

 &HT;    Sowing seeds of success
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Post-holiday letdown gives a lot of people the blahs. But it can
also be a breather and a time to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have some time off this week, or at least a slack
period at work. Most of us have been partying, spending and
generally going at warp speed for weeks now. And almost all of us
suffer from nagging suspicions that things have gotten complicated,
expensive and a little bit out of control.
</P>
<P>
   One way to recover is to try to get a grip on your financial
life. With a little organization and effort, you can begin to
recoup some feeling of control over your financial life.
</P>
<P>
   Think of these 10 steps as fairly concrete ways to get your
financial act together, shed bad habits and start building good
ones.
</P>
<P>
   1. Establish some goals
</P>
<P>
   Set aside an hour _ with spouse or significant other _ to figure
out where you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jot down all the achievements you can think of. For example, you
might write down the amount you want to save or invest for major
expenses _ a big vacation, a new home, even retirement. Paying off
the holiday debts on your credit cards might be another big item
right now. The important thing is to get them all together and sort
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have your list, go through it again and rank them, from
most important to least. Then try to estimate how much each will
cost, and when you will need the money.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can begin to balance your aspirations to your means. If
you're saving a lot for a home down payment, for example, you may
have to keep retirement saving to a minimum for the time being. Bad
idea, but maybe necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Your goals may start with some or all of the next nine steps. If
all of this is overwhelming, then pick the one, two or three you
can really benefit from.
</P>
<P>
   But keep your feet on the ground:
</P>
<P>
   _ Set reasonable goals. Maybe you can divert $38.50 from each
week's paycheck, so you'll have a filled-up individual retirement
account at the end of the year. If that's too much, a reasonable
goal may to be to save $10 a week and leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be specific. ``I'm going to start saving'' is a pretty
sentiment. ``I'm going to save $10 a week'' is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay positive. You want goals to work toward, not bad habits
to avoid. The point is to achieve, not to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get organized
</P>
<P>
   Nothing promotes confusion as much as jumbled or mislaid
records. If that's your problem, here is your solution:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gather up all your important financial and legal documents.
This includes insurance policies, bank statements, investment
records, deeds and mortgage records, wills, maybe even medical
records. And don't forget tax documents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a filing system for records that keep growing, such
as health insurance claims and tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide where you will keep each record. Some records _ such as
appraisals of your valuables, stock certificates and deeds _ need
to go to a safe deposit box at the bank. Consider keeping a
fire-proof box at home for documents difficult or impossible to
replace. Those might include wills, passports and insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a list of all those documents and where you put them.
Make sure your executor or some other responsible party has a copy
of the list.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pay off your consumer debts
</P>
<P>
   Paying high interest rates on credit cards is a waste of money.
Come up with a schedule for paying all your bills, not just paying
the minimums. Otherwise, you have converted your wallet into an
income stream for the lender.
</P>
<P>
   Often you can expedite the process by finding lower interest
credit cards. On the Internet, check out http://www.bankrate.com or
http://www.cardtrak.com for credit cards that will give you a lower
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   4. Review your checkbook
</P>
<P>
   This is a rough-and-ready substitute for a budget. Along with
your checkbook, review the charges on your credit cards for the
last three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   You are fishing for unpleasant surprises _ an unexpected amount
of money spent on restaurants or at fancy retailers, for example.
With luck, you'll spot some areas where you're willing to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Review your investments
</P>
<P>
   Once a year, every investor ought to sort through the stocks,
mutual funds and other investments in his or her portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As you look at each one, ask yourself: Would I buy more shares
today? Do I think this holding has more growing room? Is it selling
at a plausible price, compared to its earnings and compared to
similar investments?
</P>
<P>
   You may find some investments you want to sell. You may find a
few you would unload if the market gets scary again. Or you may
choose to hold on _ but with a much better understanding of what
you own, and why.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an asset allocation plan, you should check whether
you are still close to your chosen limits. Let's say you intend to
hold 50 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds and 25 percent cash. The
market's growth in recent years could have greatly increased the
percentage you have in stocks. You may want to shift some holdings
around, selling appreciated stock and putting the money into bonds
or money markets.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to include holdings in 401(k)s or other retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   6. Tune up your savings program
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, 56 percent of Americans said they could
afford to save $20 a week. The chart shows how much money you would
save by investing that small amount over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't do it by yourself, the best thing may be an
automatic savings plan. It's easy enough: Ask your bank or a mutual
fund company to set up an automatic transfer from your checking
account to a savings account. If you work for a large company, you
may be able have a payroll deduction made to a credit union. The
principle is if you don't see it, you won't spend it.
</P>
<P>
   7. Put money in your
</P>
<P>
   retirement plans
</P>
<P>
   Average people have a hard time coming by tax breaks these days.
Among the remaining ones are individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   You may get upfront tax deductions, and you will get
tax-deferred earnings on investments in those plans. In a 401(k),
employers often make matching donations _ free money.
</P>
<P>
   8. Review your insurance
</P>
<P>
   If you have gone through one of life's big events, such as
marriage or the birth of a child, you need to re-examine your life
insurance needs.
</P>
<P>
   Your property insurance may need a review, too. Is the coverage
still adequate? Could you lower your cost, perhaps by raising
deductibles? Did Santa bring you jewelry, an expenive camera or
other goodies that might require special-purpose policies?
</P>
<P>
   The problem with insurance is the field is full of variegated
products, eager salespeople and confusion. A good book to help
clear the confusion is Janet Bamford's ``Smarter Insurance
Solutions.'' It costs $19.95. You can order it by calling
1-800-233-4830.
</P>
<P>
   9. Keep on learning
</P>
<P>
   Rresources for personal finance information are innumerable,
including this and other newspapers, an array of magazines and many
books. The old reliable among all-purpose financial planning books
is Jane Bryant Quinn's ``Making the Most of Your Money.'' For
investing, take a look at ``Stocks for the Long Run'' by Jeremy J.
Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   On the Net, you can find advice and good links at
http://www.moneycentral
</P>
<P>
   .com, http://www.quicken.com, and http://www.investorama.com.
</P>
<P>
   10. Review your will
</P>
<P>
   You need to make sure it reflects major changes in your life,
such as births or divorce. Is your executor still available to
handle your estate?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's a good idea to prepare a list of
beneficiaries and their addresses. Leave a copy with your will.
</P>
<P>
   One more step: Consider executing a power of attorney for health
care and a living will. Those documents become important if you are
no longer able to make decisions for yourself.

 &HT;    RollerJam: A little bit of sport, a little glitz and glamour
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The crowd is, for the most part, canned.
</P>
<P>
   These are theme-park visitors, people at Universal Studios in
Orlando who bump into someone on skates and get handed tickets.
Roller derby, they say.
</P>
<P>
   So the curious are shuttled to a sound stage and led inside, to
rows of aluminum bleachers around a banked track. They wait
politely while cameras are moved into place.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow they must be whipped into television-ready fans. The
announcer booms that roller derby, 25 years dead, is back. ``Pick a
team! Root for your team all night!'' People in the stands ask,
``Who's playing?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. A couple of ``fans'' get last-minute makeup from
a woman in a white blouse. One, a girlfriend of a skater, wears a
fur-lined sweater, a tight skirt and very un-theme-park stilettos.
The camera will go to her for close-ups when her boyfriend gets
clocked _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   A few bursts of smoke, heavy-metal music comes up, and two teams
of 20 men and women roll past the big TV screen and onto the banked
track.
</P>
<P>
   They line up to begin, and the second they do, lights that have
been rigged to look like flashbulbs pop.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the crowd catches on.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple. Pick a team, then scream while it scrambles around
a banked track on skates, shoving away opponents with hands, elbows
and well-placed knees.
</P>
<P>
   The game is simple, too. Men, then women, take turns trying to
break from the pack and lap members of the other team. Each person
lapped is a point.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything goes. Referees ``frown upon'' kicking and
biting. And they break up fights.
</P>
<P>
   From his RV parked out back, Ross K. Bagwell Sr. watches and
fingers a long unlit cigar. Bagwell, a part-time Jupiter Island
resident, is trying to bring back roller derby. He is an executive
producer of RollerJam, which is taping its first season here. The
first game will be on TNN on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The history, in brief, is this.
</P>
<P>
   1935: Starts as endurance skating, men and women just going
around a track.
</P>
<P>
   1938: Two skaters get into a fight one night in Miami. Writer
Damon Runyon talks roller derby creator Leo Seltzer into making
violence a part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   1948: Starts TV run.
</P>
<P>
   1973: Sport dies. Blamed on the oil crisis and bad economy.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer's son, Jerry, is part of the RollerJam group. The rest
are a few roller derby veterans and a lot of young in-line skaters
without a clue _ until they watched the old TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are experts at being elbowed in the head and sagging
halfway over the outside rail. The women tear off their helmets and
pull each other's hair. An entire pack wipes out, and an
enterprising skater leaps over them and scores six points.
</P>
<P>
   It is wrestling on wheels, some say, to which Bagwell responds,
``They don't script it, they skate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. ``We do instruct them not to kill anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Harris, from Birmingham, Ala., sits in the crowd. He
remembers the old days. But his wife, Annette, 25, only knows
roller derby from an old episode of C.H.I.P.S. She decides to cheer
for the California Quakes, not the New York Enforcers, because she
prefers blue jerseys to black.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Johnston also is watching her first RollerJam game. But she
knows what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, from West Palm Beach, skates for the league's Texas
Twisters. She is 41 but looks about 30. She has been a dancer, a
competitive water-skier and a roller hockey player. She organized
South Florida's first all-woman roller hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   She got into roller derby this spring in Fort Lauderdale, where
a man named Patrick Schaefer installed an old banked track in a
warehouse near I-95. He wanted a revival.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't go well. For one thing, the warehouse had no
air-conditioning. And Johnston's first paycheck bounced.
</P>
<P>
   Then a teammate discovered RollerJam in Orlando and invited her
up. She had her doubts. But she also had a promise: RollerJam would
pay her, even for training. Once she finished EMT school in Delray
Beach, she started spending weekdays at RollerJam's rink in
Sanford, practicing blocks and plays.
</P>
<P>
   She won't say how much she makes (Bagwell says skaters make from
$300 to $1,000 a week), but it's enough to make roller derby her
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a stethoscope in her gym bag, in case someone _ or the
sport itself _ wipes out.
</P>
<P>
   A woman skater for the New York Enforcers hangs out beside the
sound stage, looking for her daughter in the crowd. She smokes a
cigarette. She already has been to the Roller Jam makeup artist.
``Can't you tell?'' she asks, pretending to powder her nose.
</P>
<P>
   The women skaters wear thongs over their padded shorts. They
wear cropped tops and several have tans. It does not hurt to look
nice, even when taking an elbow to the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Looks-wise, many of the men are crowd-pleasers, too. One is even
a former Mr. Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are given nicknames: The Bod Squad. The Sisters of
Suffering. They get story lines: Some will fall in love. Some will
become enemies. The Enforcers are supposed to be the bad guys. The
crowd plays along: ``Hey, go back to New York!''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who has a daughter and son, doesn't want a nickname.
``I'd rather not have a story line about me,'' she says, watching
the track. ``I'd rather be known for my skating.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a blocker. There's this cool move she did once in Fort
Lauderdale, flipping an opposing skater over her shoulder. ``I can
actually take my foot up and kick them in the face,'' she says.
``They might not allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game's first turn, the elbowing begins. A woman is
flipped over the rail and lands outside the track. More pushing.
The announcer works on his John Madden impression: ``Boom!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd still needs prompting, falling silent between fights
and falls. The camera crews, hoping to boost the applause level,
flap their arms like sparrows on expresso.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a lot better on TV than in actual live performance,''
Johnston admits.
</P>
<P>
   Behind her, Annette Harris nudges her husband. ``It's not such a
bad game.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Hmmmph. (Pause.) It's not as good as ice skating.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, they split. It is 24-17, Quakes.
</P>
<P>
   What's the right word for a roller derby competition? A game? A
match? A couple of younger skaters check the rules. (A game.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely what the public wants to see,'' says Andrea
Franklin, Johnston's roommate and former in-line skating instructor
from Miami. ``A little bit of sport, a little glitz and glamour.
Pretty girls, roughneck guys, you've got everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, even. The woman knocked over the rail has a
concussion. One referee broke his left arm on the first day of
taping. (His X-rays will be featured on Roller Jam's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   It is now 41-40, Quakes. But even though the scoreboard under
the lone piece of advertising, a banner from Auto Zone, says there
is one scoring period left, the players are leaving the track. The
crowd hesitates, confused. It's over?
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard changes. Oops, no periods left after all.
``Well,'' Johnston says. ``I guess that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roller Jam has a year to prove itself. Easy, says Seltzer, the
new league's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He says Madison Square Garden has called. The Forum, too.
``We've got places to play now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially since we're replacing the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Boom!

 &HT;    If girls think pink, it's probably because of Barbie
 &HT;    By Alison M. Bour
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Just buy her something Barbie,'' says my
brother. ``She loves anything to do with Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. Shopping for my niece will be easy. A quick jaunt to a
nearby store to pick up ``something Barbie.'' It doesn't take me
long to find the very large, very pink Barbie department.
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of Barbies there. There are Barbies that ride
horses and Barbies that sit on their patio with friends sipping
lemonade. There are even Barbies that look like mermaids and are
capable of growing multicolored hair down to their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   There are Barbies who wear way too much makeup, and Barbies that
come with their own kitchens, hair salons and shopping carts. With
a few minor variations all the Barbies look like twins. And, except
for the baby Barbies, they wear exactly the same size clothes. Rows
and rows of perfectly formed plastic. Great.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to feel a little sick to my stomach, and it's not
because I'm in an overheated store. OK, just stick to the clothes,
I think. After all, with all the Barbies being the same size, at
least they'll fit. I take a closer look at the billions of Barbie
outfits. Most of them look like something a dancer at a cheap strip
club would tear off in the middle of her act. I notice the fine
print: ``For ages 3 and up,'' it reads. Now I'm not only nauseated.
I'm appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all at once to my surprise, I see her. Airline Stewardess
Barbie! She is part of the Barbies Can Have Any Career They Want If
They Put Their Minds To It Collector Series. Just like Frosty the
Snowman when he gets out of that hot greenhouse, I feel a glimmer
of hope well up inside of me. This Barbie looks excited, dashing
off to a promising job with a major airline. She's ready, she's
confident, and I'm sure she will be the best stewardess ever.
</P>
<P>
   If she is able to serve drinks standing on the balls of her
toes, that is. I commend Airline Barbie's courage to tackle the
real world but I'm worried about her health. It's bound to be
impossible to dash through a busy airport wearing 6-inch heels, and
it's going to cost the airline a lot of money when she needs back
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   I also wonder why Stewardess Barbie's breasts look like Mount
Rushmore compared with the rest of her delicate, fragile frame. If
the plane hits a little bit of turbulence, I'm certain she is going
to topple over, snapping her rib cage in several places. Then how
will she help the passengers exit down the escape slide if there's
an emergency?
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that teachers, even those who think they are aware
of sex role stereotypes, still accidentally encourage intellectual
development in boys more so than they do in girls. Standing in the
middle of the very large, very pink Barbie department, no one can
blame the girls for not protesting. By that time they've been
brainwashed by Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few Barbie knock-offs to choose from. They are
called Ms. Glamour _ or something like that _ and they are also
packaged in pink. I don't find anything interesting in that aisle
either _ no Barbie architects, computer wizards, engineers or race
car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something encouraging catches my eye. Dr. Barbie! A
physician outfit complete with a stethoscope, surgical mask and
sensible shoes. ``Paging Dr. Barbie, paging Dr. Barbie.'' Cool. I
like the sound of that.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known better. The doctor outfit is nicely packaged
in a pink box but it's not for Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   It's for Dr. Ken.
</P>
<P>
   He wears the doctor pants in this family.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie is too busy shopping and fixing her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am overheated.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm tired, too. Eventually, I decide on a Barbie car. It's a
convertible and looks like it would be fun to drive. The car comes
with its own detailing and seat beats, and my decision on which one
to purchase is made easier because the Barbie car comes in only one
color. Any guesses?
</P>
<P>
   While I'm standing in line, I decide to pursue a new career
designing Barbie dolls and dreaming up realistic lives for them. My
favorite Barbie is sexy, beautiful, smart, successful, rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   At a size 12, she represents the majority of women. She saves a
lot of money because she wears little or no makeup. Sure, there are
times when she wishes she had bigger breasts, but she's too busy
saving lives at the hospital to worry much about it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone envies my Barbie. She's popular and has a really cute
boyfriend. They go to lots of fun parties together. Barbie's
boyfriend is a flight attendant with a major airline so he always
wears sensible shoes. I'm feeling better already.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll call my new invention Brain Surgeon Barbie.

 &HT;    Georgian ensures plenty of action on the football field during
halftimes
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LILBURN, Ga. _ Most of the time, it's the big, sweaty guys in
shoulder pads who hog all the glory during this, the football
season's climax. But when the gridders head for the lockers at
halftime, Pam Antista becomes the belle of the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, Antista has been choreographing razzle-dazzle
cheerleader spectaculars for many of the biggest college and pro
football classics, including the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the
Gator Bowl and the Super Bowl _ 54 bowl games in all.
</P>
<P>
   She has hand-picked and trained hundreds of cheerleaders,
majorettes and cloggers.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-something (she coyly refuses to tell her age) Antista has
been shaking pompons ever since she was a kid. Blond and taut,
she's a hard-charging, cliche-spouting, cheerleading true believer
who _ except for her gender _ might have made a gutsy all-state
tailback for some proud coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always used to say, `You couldn't play football so
you did the next best thing,' '' Antista recalls of her dad, Harry
Newberry, a former high school coach in DeKalb County, Ga., where
she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the coach's daughter, everybody wants to pick you
up and play with you and teach you all the cheerleader moves,'' she
says. ``I thought that waving my arms and cheering all the time was
what I was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Antista worked the sidelines at high school and later at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After college, she opened a gym for cheerleaders, then another
several years later. She also trained cheerleaders at Georgia Tech
and did choreography for the Atlanta Hawks dance troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she became one of America's top go-to girls for
rah-rah, razzle-dazzle halftime shows.
</P>
<P>
   Every football season she endures sleepless nights, impossible
deadlines, missed dinners with her husband and 6-year-old daughter
and countless hours of training.
</P>
<P>
   She demands ``110 percent'' of herself and her staff, she
declared during a break at her cheerleader gym, USA Cheers, where
her teams train for bowl games and cheerleading competitions.
``When you really care as much as I do, you want everything to be
as good as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos of somersaults and scissor kicks, Antista is a
calm but coiled presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good. That's good. Annnnd up!'' she commands as her
squad performs a maneuver called a ``cuppie,'' which entails beefy
cheer-guys hoisting cheer-gals into the air with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Antista choreographs each routine, copies it on videotape, then
mails tapes to the high school and college cheering squads she has
recruited for her halftime extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process demands _ contrary to certain cheerleader
stereotypes _ a good deal of mental acuity, organization and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just wonderful,'' said Sue Ann Jenkins, national
director of Bowl Games of America in Salt Lake City. The company
hired Antista for the Orange, Sugar and the Gator bowls this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the ability to bring together quickly and put together
a very athletic show with routines that are very difficult and
exciting to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   While the groups might have months to prepare before arriving in
the bowl city, they often have less than 12 hours to practice with
other participating squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many parts to fit together, and you've got to
know what you're doing,'' said Melanie Dangerfield, a former
twirler for Georgia Tech who has worked with Antista for 11 years.
``We're working in these big arenas, and no matter where we are on
the field, she always knows what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, into every cheerleader's life a little bad confetti must
fall. Several years ago, while her business was booming, Antista
was on the verge of career burnout.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to quit, she contacted Texie Waterman, the grande dame
of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, whom she had seen on reruns of
the 1970s sitcom ``The Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterman invited her to Dallas and put the Georgian through her
paces: First they performed some basic cheers to ``Turkey in the
Straw,'' then moved into more complex jazz and Broadway-style dance
routines.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman, Antista recalls, ``pulled out a whole different side
of me that I'd never seen before. She showed me when you run into a
wall, bounce off and head in a new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Antista returned home refreshed. She has been a fixture of the
college bowl circuit ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Her defining moment was ``Rocking Country Sunday,'' the halftime
show she helped stage in the Georgia Dome for the Super Bowl on
Jan. 30, 1994. It featured 2,200 performers.
</P>
<P>
   But Antista doesn't dwell on past glories. This cheerleader for
cheerleading has more work to do, that old stereotype be darned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this so much, and I'm sharing it with the people who
count _ the performers and the fans. I can't make everyone love
sports or cheerleading, and you can't worry about people laughing
at you. I would only say to them, `Just watch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Catch Pam Antista's halftime handiwork this weekend during three
big bowl games:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gator Bowl, 12:30 p.m. Friday, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sugar Bowl, 8:30 p.m. Friday, ABC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orange Bowl, 8:30 p.m. Saturday, ABC.

 &HT;    Military brats using Internet to find old pals
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Diane Atherton, life as a military brat meant a
different school each year. Three schools in seventh grade in New
York. Her senior year in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For her, as for many military dependents, home was wherever you
happened to live at the time. Friendships formed quickly, and often
ended just as abruptly when families moved to other posts.
</P>
<P>
   Now many ``military brats,'' like Atherton, are rekindling
friendships formed decades ago by using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Military Brats Registry, based in California, contains more
than 14,400 names and claims at least one marriage from reunited
high school sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Military Brats Online, created by Vann Baker of
Roswell, Ga., carries reunion notices and reminiscences of base
life.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton, 52, has found many classmates. ``People that I didn't
think I would ever hear from again, like my girlfriend in Denver,
people who live in Hawaii, folks who travel all over the Asian
Pacific Rim, they're all being reconnected,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton and Sharon Wolfe of Denver, a friend from Yamato High
School in Japan, now e-mail each other frequently and travel
together once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a big family, and my sister died about 10 or 12
years ago, so it's nice to have someone who knew the same people I
did,'' Atherton says. ``There's a piece of me that's missing, and
now it's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Others share those sentiments. Valeria Palmer, 44, started
reading military brat newsgroups a decade ago. Her family moved 10
times before she turned 18; on the Internet, she found community.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been very helpful to me is to discover that others
had the same experiences and feelings that I did,'' she says. ``To
learn about how the child I was makes me the person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Curtis of Redlands, Calif., started the Military Brats
Registry site in 1997 while trying to find childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Baker takes another approach with Military Brats Online, which
lists hundreds of alumni groups for military schools.
</P>
<P>
   He's making new friends by organizing metro Atlanta brat
reunions and meeting others through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being of a different ethnic background, but you
don't really look different from anyone else,'' says Baker, 42.
``You fit in, but you know you're not like everyone else. That's
part of what fuels this desire to want to reconnect again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. For others, a little catching up goes a long way. Like a
high school reunion, once you've gotten updates on jobs and
families, there's not much left to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``People you were friends with when you were 8, it's nice to see
them, know they're still around,'' says Zach Fowl. ``But when
you're 27, things change.''

 &HT;    The year of playing dangerously
 &HT;    (EDS: TAKE 1 OF TWO TAKES)
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the playing field, 1998 was the best of
years.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa blasting past Babe Ruth and
Roger Maris. It was the Denver Broncos and the Tennessee Lady
Volunteers pursuing perfection, and the New York Yankees attaining
their own slice of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Atlantic, 1998 was France wildly
celebrating its World Cup soccer win and the cycling world
thrilling to the remarkable ride of Marco Pantani in the Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, off the field, 1998 was the worst of years for the sporting
world.
</P>
<P>
   For every great thrill, there was an eerie chill about what was
powering those electrifying performances. For every cheer, there
was a gnawing fear in sport's Year of Playing Dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only a year of home runs, touchdowns and goals, but
one of pills, powders, police raids and tribunals. It was a year
when performance-enhancing substances stole headlines in a wide
spectrum of sports, on a range of continents. It was a year that
made 1988, the infamous one stained by Ben Johnson's Olympic drug
scandal, look almost pristine.
</P>
<P>
   This year was a bottle of androstenedione sitting ominously in
McGwire's locker while record-setting shot-putter Randy Barnes was
getting banned for life for using the same substance.
</P>
<P>
   It was the French police busting the Tour de France and getting
huge hauls of everything from human growth hormone to the
endurance-enhancing substance erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
   It was a doping scandal that rocked Italy's top soccer league,
bringing down that country's highest ranking official in sports,
Italian Olympic Committee head Mario Pescante. There, fans yelled
``drogati'' _ druggies _ at Juventus, one of Italy's most storied
teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chinese swimmers getting kicked out of the World
Championships in Australia for drugs and Ireland's Michelle Smith,
a triple gold-medalist in the Atlanta Olympics, being banned for
four years for tampering with her drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   It was rugby leagues in both Ireland and Australia, after years
of denial, discovering that steroid use had infected their sports,
perhaps critically.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the year that creatine, a legal but controversial
food supplement with unknown long-term effects, became the
breakfast of champions.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's football players began their title run by fighting
heat cramps in their creatine-laced muscles in their opening win
against Syracuse. The Super Bowl-champion Broncos used it quite
conspicuously for fuel. They also raised the NFL's level of concern
when John Elway, Terrell Davis and other Broncos wore hats with the
logo of Experimental and Applied Sciences during Super Bowl week.
The Colorado-based company is one of the biggest producers of
creatine products and the Broncos were estimated to be the NFL
leaders in creatine consumption and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting New York Yankees, the Texas Longhorns and
even France's world-champion soccer team have been proponents of
the muscle-builder that was the rage of pro, college and even some
high school teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   1998 also flashed back to use of performance-enhancing
substances in years past. In Berlin, two trials dredged up the
sordid performance secrets of former East German sports officials
and doctors who gave steroids to young swimmers. They were part of
that country's systematic sports doping program that may have
involved as many as 10,000 athletes. The trials brought home three
sobering facts of performance-enhancing substances: they can
dramatically improve performance, they can cause long-lasting
health problems and sophisticated users can escape detection.
</P>
<P>
   Even more chilling, 1998 gave us a glimpse of the future.
Advertisements for creatine aired during the Little League World
Series. And researchers in Massachusetts found that boys as young
as 10 are taking steroids and that junior-high girls had caught up
to their male counterparts in the use of that illegal substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sport was immune from steroid abuse,'' said researcher
Avery Faigenbaum. ``And as far as androstenedione, sales up here
have gone bezonkers. The greatest ad for it is Mark McGwire.
Adolescents are thinking `I want to get bigger, faster and
stronger, and I want it right now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Canadian sprinter banned a decade ago, surveyed
today's sport scene and warned in a London paper that ``the whole
world was pointing at me and saying I was the big, bad guy _ the
only guy taking substances. Now they can't hide from the truth. Now
the world has seen that no sport is fair, that there is no level
playing field _ that cyclists are at it, Dennis Mitchell and Randy
Barnes, the East Germans, the Chinese, everybody is at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Barnes, a 300-pound Olympic champion shot-putter,
test positive for a banned muscle-builder, so did a 58-year-old
Japanese snooker player and an Indonesian badminton player before
the Asian Games. When a London newspaper, the Independent,
conducted an extensive survey of the elite in British athletics,
only 3 percent of athletes responded that they thought their sport
was perfectly clean. A greater percentage thought that at least 60
percent of the athletes were cheating.
</P>
<P>
   A disparity in rules
</P>
<P>
   Performance-enhancing substances are found in an ever-increasing
array in sports and their legality can vary from sport to sport. By
baseball's definition, McGwire was not cheating when he used
androstenedione. It's legal there and in the NHL and NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is, however, banned by the International Olympic
Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, because
it is a precursor for testosterone (the body converts it to
testosterone).
</P>
<P>
   Raising the level of testosterone, a natural steroid, is one way
athletes can attempt to get an edge in strength and explosiveness.
Taking steroids such as nandralone and stanozolol is another.
Although steroids are banned by Major League Baseball, there's no
testing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a speed limit with no cops. It's an autobahn,'' said
Terry Todd, a University of Texas professor who's an expert on
human performance and who has reported on drug problems in sport.
``Something is juiced in baseball, but it's not the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Steroids can be detected by tests. Currently, human growth
hormone cannot. It can produce steroid-like gains and its use is so
widespread that some have labeled the 1996 Atlanta Games the HGH
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A widening spectrum
</P>
<P>
   Another substance that has kept some athletes a step ahead of
the drug police is EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPO is to endurance what steroids do for strength,'' Todd
said.
</P>
<P>
   It can increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, but in a
worst-case scenario it can also turn a person's blood into so much
sludge and cause death.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, no one knows if creatine has any adverse effects other
than causing muscle cramping when used without proper hydration.
The substance is found naturally in the body and in foods such as
meat, but not in the huge proportions ingested by today's athletes,
who use a variety of creatine products.
</P>
<P>
   Performance-enhancing substances made news almost as soon as the
new year began. In January, many of the world's best swimmers
gathered in Perth, Australia, for the World Championships. The
Chinese swimmers, who created controversy in the 1990s with their
record swims and failed drug tests, arrived intent on cleaning up
their image.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 8, Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan, a silver-medalist in
the 1994 World Championships, was stopped at the Sydney airport.
Authorities checked a Thermos and found 13 vials of Somatropin, a
human growth hormone. She was kicked out of the competition, and a
few days later four other Chinese swimmers tested positive for
Triamterene, a masking agent.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a notable absentee from the Championships,
Michelle Smith, was given an out-of-competition test in Ireland.
International swimming officials said her urine sample came back
with a high enough concentration of whiskey in it to kill a person
_ or to render a drug test useless. Smith, a heroine for Ireland in
1996, was later banned for four years by swimming's international
governing board, FINA. Smith has repeatedly denied using
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think never in the history of doping has there been an
instance where someone who got caught admitted it,'' Todd said. He
said many athletes rationalize it by assuming that their
competitors are on something and, ``they don't want to get caught
taking a knife to a gunfight.''
</P>
<P>
   British swimmer Michael Fibbens, a three-time Olympian, said,
``You spend your whole life trying to get to the top of your sport,
and when you eventually get to the top five in the world, the four
people above you are possibly cheats. And then you've got to deal
with the fact you wasted so much time to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fibbens tested positive for benzoylecgonine. He said the
metabolite of cocaine was from recreational use, but it's also a
stimulant. He received a one-year ban.
</P>
<P>
   Tour de France's turmoil
</P>
<P>
   The doping scandals reached unprecedented proportions in the
summer, when teams at the Tour de France were busted by police
after authorities found what amounted to rolling drug labs for some
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shocked at what was going on with the Tour'' said
Bill Stapleton, a former UT swimmer and chairman of the athletes
advisory committee for the USOC. Stapleton also represents cyclist
Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance has been racing against cheats,'' Stapleton said. ``If
they don't clean it up his sport is going away. Because of what
happened on the Tour, sponsors are saying enough is enough, or
we're out of it. The athletes have been screaming for 15 years. If
they don't fix it, they can kiss the Tour de France goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   When a van for the Festina team was stopped at the
French-Belgian border, authorities say they found 235 doses of EPO,
82 shots of human growth hormone and 60 doses of testosterone,
along with syringes and masking agents.
</P>
<P>
   Festina was later kicked out of the Tour after admitting to an
organized drug-taking program. Another team, TVM, quickly became
caught in the spreading scandal. Before the 12th stage riders from
all the teams staged a two-hour strike to protest their treatment.
But as the authorities kept pressing, teams began dropping out of
the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, problems were beginning to surface in
professional soccer in Italy's prestigious Serie A. The coach of
the Roma club, Zdenek Zeman, was asked what he thought was wrong
with Italian soccer. He said he thought players spent too much time
at the chemist. That statement triggered investigations that
resulted in some of the highest officials in Italian sport
resigning and the country's main drug-testing lab losing its
certification. By December the soccer drug scandal, in which human
growth hormone and EPO were again at the center of allegations,
still wasn't wrapped up. Two more high-ranking officials were
questioned this month about possible coverups in the drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Another doping matter still unresolved is the curious case of
flamboyant Sri Lankan sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe, who aims to
be the Flo-Jo of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. She showed up for the
Asian Games even though she was under an international suspension
for testing positive for a steroid in April.

 &HT;    SPORTS-DRUGS98 _ TAKE 2 OF TWO
 &HT;    By John Maher

   (Continued from Take 1)
</P>
<P>
   Doping's past history
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Jayasinghe was making news, the court trials in
Berlin of former East German doctors and trainers demonstrated how
long doping practices have been influencing the outcome of sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   East Germany built a sports factory that churned out Olympic
medals, but when that Communist regime collapsed, its secret
police, the Stasi, was not able to destroy many of its massive
surveillance files.
</P>
<P>
   One dark secret exposed was the often-suspected _ but never
proved _ doping of East German athletes. The files showed that the
doping was larger and more systematic than almost anyone had
suspected. The trials of former swimming officials at two Berlin
clubs are just the beginning on a legal effort that may last beyond
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that German prosecutors have 90 cases against 680
defendants to pursue. The athletes involved, who often were told
they were ingesting vitamins, suffered a variety of side effects
from the doping, ranging from acne and deepened voices to heart and
liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   The swim trials, which produced several convictions, had added
interest in this country, because U.S. Swimming was seeking medals
and recognition for swimmers who had lost to illegally doped East
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Sterkel, now the women's swimming coach at the University
of Texas, was the youngster on the 1976 U.S. swimming team in
Montreal that arrived with typically high expectations and a new
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear deep voices in the locker room,'' Sterkel said. ``I
knew they were big, but I thought we could beat them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. There were 13 Olympic gold medals awarded in women's
swimming in 1976, and the husky and husky-throated East Germans won
11 of them. Sterkel was part of the U.S.'s only gold, a freestyle
relay, as the U.S. team was crushed physically and emotionally .
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our 20-year reunion in 1996,'' Sterkel said of that
1976 American team. ``I didn't realize how badly they were hurt. It
was their meet, but they didn't go home as heroes. Their homecoming
was not real pleasant. They felt embarrassed to be part of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suffered a bigger disappointment than Shirley Babashoff.
Projected as an Olympic heroine, she swam good times but couldn't
beat the East Germans. When she complained of possible steroid use
she was dubbed ``Surly Shirley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It affected Shirley's life,'' Sterkel said. ``She was seen as
a crybaby, a sore loser. I don't think anything could take away
that kind of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. sought a gold medal or some form of recognition this
year for the medley relay team of Babashoff, Lauri Siering, Linda
Jezek and Camille Wright. Bu the International Olympic Committee,
not wishing to get bogged down in what one official termed a
``bottomless swamp,'' chose not to change medal standings in past
events.
</P>
<P>
   Sterkel also swam in the 1988 Games in Seoul, where she finished
tied for third in the 50-meter freestyle behind winner Kristin
Otto. Otto was not involved in either trial, but her name has come
up in the Stasi files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I wouldn't tell them no, but I don't think it's
important,'' Sterkel said of any medal hopes. ``Now, they're paying
for it with their lives. It seems a little petty for me to want a
medal. They were worse victims than me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched what happened to Shirley and learned to be quiet. My
whole career, it wasn't equal. I knew how good I was and if the
rest of the world doesn't know, I'm OK with that.''
</P>
<P>
   A questionable future
</P>
<P>
   One of the arguments against rewriting history is that there is
no way of knowing that the athletes beaten by the East Germans were
clean themselves, since athletes were able to beat the existing
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard too many stories,'' Sterkel said. ``I think the
U.S. has been involved, maybe at the Olympic Trials so they don't
test positive at the Olympics. You hear stories of other big names
that didn't get thrown out of the Olympics. The biggest joke in the
athlete's village was how Ben Johnson was dumb enough to get
caught. It makes you wonder what others were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton said the USOC, like other governing bodies, is aware
of the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been accused of being the fox guarding the hen house,''
Stapleton said. Frequently, when an athlete runs afoul of an
international governing body over a failed drug test, the first
ones to champion his or her cause is the national governing body of
the athlete's home country. It happened with Smith and Jayasinghe
this year, and U.S. Track and Field has cleared such athletes as
Mary Slaney and Dennis Mitchell before the International bodies
were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Said researcher Stapleton, ``the buzz word is externalization.''
The IOC, USOC and other bodies want to let drug testing be done by
disinterested parties.
</P>
<P>
   Drug testing is becoming more sophisticated, but drug cheats
have managed to beat the system for more than two decades. And in
1998 it looks like a new generation of rule-breakers is on the way,
according to groundbreaking research reported in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Said Faigenbaum: ``From talking to parents, from understanding
what goes on in youth sports, we had a feeling steroid use was
there. We attempted to get baseline data. We found that about half
these kids knew that steroids make you bigger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   His group also discovered that 2.6 percent of the girls and 2.8
percent of the boys in four junior high schools that were sampled
had used illegal steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found some disturbing trends,'' said Faigenbaum, who saw
steroid use in gymnastics, where it does just about everything an
obsessed coach could want. ``In addition to strength and power, it
can also stunt your growth with a premature closure of the growth
plate,'' Faigenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   With the rapid rise in popularity of supplements such as
creatine and androstenedione, Faigenbaum said he is sorry he didn't
ask about more substances in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is legal, but it raises interesting issues,'' he
said. ``Why is that 10-year-old taking creatine? What are we asking
our kids to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently nothing that hasn't been done in the past. This year
the most infamous sprinter of all time, Johnson, crowed, ``So Ben
Johnson is not the only one doing it. And I was never alone. In
1988 I was never alone. The majority at Seoul were on some
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, 1988, was the most disturbing in sports. Until now.

 &HT;    Germaine wins respect through calm attitude
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When Rob Murphy first saw Ohio State quarterback
Joe Germaine three years ago, the Buckeye offensive lineman could
hardly believe his eyes. This freckled-face, clean-cut,
boyish-looking guy was going to lead OSU's offense; stand in the
pocket and take devastating hits, rally the troops when the game
was on the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just looked at him and he didn't look like a quarterback.
I thought he was trying out for the cheerleading squad,'' Murphy
said Monday during the Buckeyes' preparation for Friday's Sugar
Bowl showdown with Texas A&AMP;M (11-2).
</P>
<P>
   Today, Murphy realizes his first impression couldn't have been
more wrong. Germaine, who will be playing in his final game as a
Buckeye on Friday, is frequently the player his OSU teammates and
coaches point to as the toughest guy on the team.
</P>
<P>
   But his toughness is not from the Chuck Norris or Mike Tyson
mold. It's much subtler than that. Murphy describes it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said about looking into a
quarterback's eyes and kind of knowing everything's going to be
OK,'' he said. ``He's like my mother-away-from-home (showing me)
everything's going to be all right if you just do your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always so cool and calm that you can just look to him and
get some calmness yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that poise and collectiveness, along with a strong,
accurate arm, that has helped No. 3 OSU to a 10-1 season and a
second straight Sugar Bowl berth and earned Germaine Big Ten
Offensive Player of the Year honors and a spot in the OSU record
book.
</P>
<P>
   His four consecutive 300-yard passing games are a school record
as are his seven in a season and eight in a career. His 55 career
touchdown passes are just two shy of Bobby Hoying's school record.
And he needs just 162 yards and three completions to surpass
Hoying's season records in each of those categories.
</P>
<P>
   As his collegiate career comes to an end, Germaine frequently
says he'd like to be remembered for more than orchestrating OSU's
winning touchdown drive _ and tossing the winning pass _ in the
Buckeyes' 1997 Rose Bowl victory. But in the next breath, the
quarterback also says he considers his MVP Rose Bowl trophy his
most coveted individual prize.
</P>
<P>
   He's admittedly disappointed he didn't realize his dream of
playing in the Jan. 4 national championship Fiesta Bowl in his home
state of Arizona. A 28-24 loss to Michigan State on Nov. 7, one of
Germaine's poorest games of the year (16-of-34, 239 yards, one
interception), prevented that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 23-year-old quarterback just wants to finish his
college career with a victory over Texas A&AMP;M on Friday. After that,
he hopes there's a spot for him in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sure like to play'' in the pros, Germaine said.
``Hopefully I've proven this year and in the previous years that
I'm capable of doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   As for anyone who meets him and thinks he might not be able to
hack the NFL, Germaine says don't judge a book by its cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first impression people get from me is, `He's a shy guy, a
quiet guy. He's not a leader,' '' Germaine said. ``That's the exact
opposite of what I am. I'm a leader by example. I want to win as
much or more than the other guy.

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ I have heard from a number of people who regard
a little school as a potential improver of our educational system.
They are all people who, like me, happened to have attended one-
and two-room schools before consolidation hit the land. (Sibley,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DISNEYQUEST _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ Tired of playing with that talking
Furby already? Check out another fur ball's first big venture into
high-tech entertainment: DisneyQuest, a five-story,
100,000-square-foot mall of interactive games. DisneyQuest is not
your father's video game ghetto. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLER-DERBY _ It's simple. Pick a team, then scream while it
scrambles around a banked track on skates, shoving away opponents
with hands, elbows and well-placed knees. Each person lapped is a
point. It's wrestling on wheels. It's ``RollerJam,'' and the
creator of this new show is hoping roller derby will catch on
again. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BARBIE _ Studies show that teachers, even those who think they
are aware of sex role stereotypes, still accidentally encourage
intellectual development in boys more so than they do in girls.
Standing in the middle of the very large, very pink Barbie
department, no one can blame the girls for not protesting. By that
time they've been brainwashed by Barbie. (Bour, Dayton Daily News)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HALFTIME _ Ever wonder who puts together those halftime shows
during bowl games? Patricia Antista is a choreographer for such
events, and her resume even includes the Super Bowl. She has a gym
in Duluth, Ga. where performers practice. (Harris, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MILBRATS-INTERNET _ Constant relocations make it hard for
military brats to maintain friendships. But the Internet is helping
many former brats reconnect with old friends and reminisce about
the days when they shopped at the p.x. and went to the post school.
(Lee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' says Stuart Levy, a Tufts
University School of Medicine microbiologist. ``Either antibiotics
are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is prescribed, or
it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.'' The upshot of this
massive exposure is disease-causing bugs that resist the drugs that
once thwarted them. They're superbugs, and their power is
frightening: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Is it too late to do anything? Peter
Radetsky, who teaches science writing at the University of
California in Santa Cruz, reports.

   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments. Elsewhere the
picture is very bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in
impoverished African and Asian countries. In Zimbabwe, for example,
one-quarter of the adult population is now thought to be infected
with HIV. Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the
virus every day. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover
magazine, reports.

   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' says Stuart Levy, a Tufts
University School of Medicine microbiologist. ``Either antibiotics
are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is prescribed, or
it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.'' The upshot of this
massive exposure is disease-causing bugs that resist the drugs that
once thwarted them. They're superbugs, and their power is
frightening: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Is it too late to do anything? Peter
Radetsky, who teaches science writing at the University of
California in Santa Cruz, reports.

   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments. Elsewhere the
picture is very bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in
impoverished African and Asian countries. In Zimbabwe, for example,
one-quarter of the adult population is now thought to be infected
with HIV. Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the
virus every day. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover

   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy's hope is that if we can get antibiotic use under
control, with physicians prescribing appropriately, according to
more precise diagnoses; if animal and agricultural use is pared
down to the bare essentials; and if household disinfectants are no
longer spiked with lingering bug killers, then we might be able to
turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The good bugs might supplant the bad, and our existing drugs
might once more be able to shoulder the load.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, advises population and evolutionary biologist
Bruce Levin from Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Levin and his student Bassam Tomeh sampled
bacteria from the diapers of 25 toddlers at a nearby day-care
center. When they isolated samples of the common gut bacteria
Escherichia coli, they found that a quarter were resistant to the
antibiotic streptomycin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have almost never used streptomycin in the last 30
years,'' Levin exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bruce is right,'' Levy concedes. ``Maybe you can't go
back again in terms of converting resistant bacteria back to
susceptible ones. But that's not the point. The point is that it's
a numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he's talking about involve the ratio between
resistant and susceptible bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If susceptibles outnumber resistants, then the more vulnerable
bugs may carry the day despite the intransigence of the others.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that may be to seed our bodies with
benign, drug-susceptible bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring in susceptible E. coli,'' Levy suggests. ``Drink it, day
in and day out. What do you think is going to happen? Resistant
strains are going to stay there? No! They're going to be shed and
the susceptibles take over.''
</P>
<P>
   This very approach is being used in animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
   In March the FDA approved a spray containing 29 types of
bacteria isolated from the guts of mature chickens. These are the
bugs that chicks would normally receive from their mothers but that
hatchery-born chicks lack. Once sprayed with the mix, the chicks
ingest the bacteria while preening themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So far the results have been promising (and in Japan, where the
spray has been available for more than a year, it has been highly
successful).
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the spray of good bugs protect the chicks from
pathogenic bacteria _ in particular Salmonella _ simply by
occupying the niches where the bad bugs would otherwise lodge, but
it discourages antibiotic use. Because why would anyone want to
give these animals antibiotics that would kill off the very bugs
that are protecting them?
</P>
<P>
   Levy considers this approach a model of what can be done in
humans. But the list of changes that must accompany such an
approach is daunting: education and more accurate diagnoses leading
to fewer, and more appropriate, prescriptions of antibiotics;
restrained use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and agriculture;
reduced use of antibacterials in household disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   And what if, after all is said and done, it just doesn't make a
difference? The years to come may be grim, indeed. The bugs are
reminding us who's boss.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right
to develop diagnostic tests and drugs based on the genes deCODE
discovers. It also gives all Icelanders free access to those drugs
and tests.
</P>
<P>
   What deCODE got from the deal is its lab full of gleaming
machinery and a huge staff expansion, which is expected to soon
number 200. Still, he probably would not have had problems with
other Icelandic researchers if it had not been for his database
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.

   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right

<P>
   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Though such therapies have reduced AIDS fatalities in the United
States and Western Europe, elsewhere the picture is almost
uniformly bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in impoverished
African and Asian countries _ the nations least prepared to prevent
and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people are now infected with HIV, and
almost 90 percent of them live in the developing countries of Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the virus every
day _ a figure twice as large as previous estimates, which were
modeled in part on the infection rate in Uganda, where the epidemic
has recently begun to plateau.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, the extent of infection is nothing short of
horrifying. In Zimbabwe, for example, one-quarter of the adult
population is now thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the ravages are not limited to Africa. India, with 4 million
cases, is now the world leader in absolute numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates are also rising with blinding speed in Ukraine,
a country that was largely free of HIV before the 1991 breakup of
the Soviet Union. It now has 110,000 people infected with HIV. That
is nearly four times as many as in all of Eastern Europe just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries can't afford expensive drugs to treat the
disease. But last year brought a bit of good news. In February the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a short,
four-week course of the anti-AIDS drug AZT during late pregnancy
and delivery halved the transmission rate of the virus from
HIV-positive women to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been heavily criticized as unethical because half
its subjects _ pregnant HIV-positive women in Thailand and the
Ivory Coast _ were given a placebo, despite results from a 1994
study showing that the drug reduced maternal HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CDC persisted, noting that the 26-week treatment the
earlier study tested costs $800 _ roughly 80 times the annual
health budget per person in many poor, developing countries. Only a
second trial could test whether a shorter, less-expensive course of
drug treatment could work, too.
</P>
<P>
   When positive results came from Thailand last February, the
trial was halted, and the Ivory Coast women on the placebo were
switched to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cost of the short, four-week course of AZT _ $50 _
is far beyond the reach of many women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS, based in Geneva, agreed to pay for the treatment of
30,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in developing countries. Glaxo
Wellcome, the maker of AZT, will supply the drug at a 60 percent to
75 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States can generally afford such preventive
strategies, there are still substantial gaps. For example, 40
percent of all U.S. AIDS cases occur among injecting drug abusers,
and the majority of pediatric AIDS cases occur among children born
to injecting drug users or their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite results from a recent government inquiry
demonstrating that needle-exchange programs can reduce HIV
transmission among injecting drug users by 30 percent, the Clinton
administration in April refused to lift a ban on federal funding
for such programs, stating that the programs send the wrong message
to children.
</P>
<P>
   This past year also saw new findings illuminating the early
history of the AIDS virus. In February, researchers led by David Ho
of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York announced
that they had isolated fragments of the HIV genome from a blood
sample drawn in 1959 from a man living in what was then
Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of Congo).
</P>
<P>
   By comparing genetic sequences of these segments with sequences
from more recent strains of HIV, they created a family tree and
traced elements in the 1959 sample to a common ancestor of three
present-day HIV subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 virus, it turned out, closely resembles the ancestral
virus, which is believed to have hopped from an animal host into
humans. Based on that resemblance, the researchers suspect the hop
probably occurred in the early 1950s or mid-1940s _ soon after the
end of World War II and the collapse of European colonialism in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of those events supports the observation that the
spread of HIV accelerates in conditions of social turmoil and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Wain-Hobson, a British virologist and AIDS researcher at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, believes that the disruption and
migration that characterized post-colonial Africa may have played a
key role in the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English and the French kept people ruthlessly under
control,'' Wain-Hobson says. ``They didn't let them move; they
didn't let them travel. And what happened finally when the English
pulled out was a free-for-all. There were pogroms, there was
corruption, there was blackmail, there were movements of
populations, the introduction of the motorcar. There was the
beginning of the urbanization of Africa, which is a postwar
event.''
</P>
<P>
   These developments, he believes, may have helped HIV expand
beyond the narrow range it occupied after it first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Wain-Hobson, ``but we
might never get beyond that.''

   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy's hope is that if we can get antibiotic use under
control, with physicians prescribing appropriately, according to
more precise diagnoses; if animal and agricultural use is pared
down to the bare essentials; and if household disinfectants are no
longer spiked with lingering bug killers, then we might be able to
turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The good bugs might supplant the bad, and our existing drugs
might once more be able to shoulder the load.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, advises population and evolutionary biologist
Bruce Levin from Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Levin and his student Bassam Tomeh sampled
bacteria from the diapers of 25 toddlers at a nearby day-care
center. When they isolated samples of the common gut bacteria
Escherichia coli, they found that a quarter were resistant to the
antibiotic streptomycin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have almost never used streptomycin in the last 30
years,'' Levin exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bruce is right,'' Levy concedes. ``Maybe you can't go
back again in terms of converting resistant bacteria back to
susceptible ones. But that's not the point. The point is that it's
a numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he's talking about involve the ratio between
resistant and susceptible bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If susceptibles outnumber resistants, then the more vulnerable
bugs may carry the day despite the intransigence of the others.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that may be to seed our bodies with
benign, drug-susceptible bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring in susceptible E. coli,'' Levy suggests. ``Drink it, day
in and day out. What do you think is going to happen? Resistant
strains are going to stay there? No! They're going to be shed and
the susceptibles take over.''
</P>
<P>
   This very approach is being used in animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
   In March the FDA approved a spray containing 29 types of
bacteria isolated from the guts of mature chickens. These are the
bugs that chicks would normally receive from their mothers but that
hatchery-born chicks lack. Once sprayed with the mix, the chicks
ingest the bacteria while preening themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So far the results have been promising (and in Japan, where the
spray has been available for more than a year, it has been highly
successful).
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the spray of good bugs protect the chicks from
pathogenic bacteria _ in particular Salmonella _ simply by
occupying the niches where the bad bugs would otherwise lodge, but
it discourages antibiotic use. Because why would anyone want to
give these animals antibiotics that would kill off the very bugs
that are protecting them?
</P>
<P>
   Levy considers this approach a model of what can be done in
humans. But the list of changes that must accompany such an
approach is daunting: education and more accurate diagnoses leading
to fewer, and more appropriate, prescriptions of antibiotics;
restrained use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and agriculture;
reduced use of antibacterials in household disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   And what if, after all is said and done, it just doesn't make a
difference? The years to come may be grim, indeed. The bugs are
reminding us who's boss.

 By ROBERT KUNZIG  
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right
to develop diagnostic tests and drugs based on the genes deCODE
discovers. It also gives all Icelanders free access to those drugs
and tests.
</P>
<P>
   What deCODE got from the deal is its lab full of gleaming
machinery and a huge staff expansion, which is expected to soon
number 200. Still, he probably would not have had problems with
other Icelandic researchers if it had not been for his database
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right
to develop diagnostic tests and drugs based on the genes deCODE
discovers. It also gives all Icelanders free access to those drugs
and tests.
</P>
<P>
   What deCODE got from the deal is its lab full of gleaming
machinery and a huge staff expansion, which is expected to soon
number 200. Still, he probably would not have had problems with
other Icelandic researchers if it had not been for his database
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

<P>
   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Though such therapies have reduced AIDS fatalities in the United
States and Western Europe, elsewhere the picture is almost
uniformly bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in impoverished
African and Asian countries _ the nations least prepared to prevent
and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people are now infected with HIV, and
almost 90 percent of them live in the developing countries of Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the virus every
day _ a figure twice as large as previous estimates, which were
modeled in part on the infection rate in Uganda, where the epidemic
has recently begun to plateau.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, the extent of infection is nothing short of
horrifying. In Zimbabwe, for example, one-quarter of the adult
population is now thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the ravages are not limited to Africa. India, with 4 million
cases, is now the world leader in absolute numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates are also rising with blinding speed in Ukraine,
a country that was largely free of HIV before the 1991 breakup of
the Soviet Union. It now has 110,000 people infected with HIV. That
is nearly four times as many as in all of Eastern Europe just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries can't afford expensive drugs to treat the
disease. But last year brought a bit of good news. In February the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a short,
four-week course of the anti-AIDS drug AZT during late pregnancy
and delivery halved the transmission rate of the virus from
HIV-positive women to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been heavily criticized as unethical because half
its subjects _ pregnant HIV-positive women in Thailand and the
Ivory Coast _ were given a placebo, despite results from a 1994
study showing that the drug reduced maternal HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CDC persisted, noting that the 26-week treatment the
earlier study tested costs $800 _ roughly 80 times the annual
health budget per person in many poor, developing countries. Only a
second trial could test whether a shorter, less-expensive course of
drug treatment could work, too.
</P>
<P>
   When positive results came from Thailand last February, the
trial was halted, and the Ivory Coast women on the placebo were
switched to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cost of the short, four-week course of AZT _ $50 _
is far beyond the reach of many women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS, based in Geneva, agreed to pay for the treatment of
30,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in developing countries. Glaxo
Wellcome, the maker of AZT, will supply the drug at a 60 percent to
75 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States can generally afford such preventive
strategies, there are still substantial gaps. For example, 40
percent of all U.S. AIDS cases occur among injecting drug abusers,
and the majority of pediatric AIDS cases occur among children born
to injecting drug users or their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite results from a recent government inquiry
demonstrating that needle-exchange programs can reduce HIV
transmission among injecting drug users by 30 percent, the Clinton
administration in April refused to lift a ban on federal funding
for such programs, stating that the programs send the wrong message
to children.
</P>
<P>
   This past year also saw new findings illuminating the early
history of the AIDS virus. In February, researchers led by David Ho
of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York announced
that they had isolated fragments of the HIV genome from a blood
sample drawn in 1959 from a man living in what was then
Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of Congo).
</P>
<P>
   By comparing genetic sequences of these segments with sequences
from more recent strains of HIV, they created a family tree and
traced elements in the 1959 sample to a common ancestor of three
present-day HIV subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 virus, it turned out, closely resembles the ancestral
virus, which is believed to have hopped from an animal host into
humans. Based on that resemblance, the researchers suspect the hop
probably occurred in the early 1950s or mid-1940s _ soon after the
end of World War II and the collapse of European colonialism in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of those events supports the observation that the
spread of HIV accelerates in conditions of social turmoil and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Wain-Hobson, a British virologist and AIDS researcher at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, believes that the disruption and
migration that characterized post-colonial Africa may have played a
key role in the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English and the French kept people ruthlessly under
control,'' Wain-Hobson says. ``They didn't let them move; they
didn't let them travel. And what happened finally when the English
pulled out was a free-for-all. There were pogroms, there was
corruption, there was blackmail, there were movements of
populations, the introduction of the motorcar. There was the
beginning of the urbanization of Africa, which is a postwar
event.''
</P>
<P>
   These developments, he believes, may have helped HIV expand
beyond the narrow range it occupied after it first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Wain-Hobson, ``but we
might never get beyond that.''

WHAT NETTERS TALK ABOUT BESIDE IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's surprising who pokes into an Internet discussion such as
Usenet's newsgroup alt.usage.english. Who knew so many English
computerists would be there?
</P>
<P>
   And the Brits don't care much about impeaching anyone, so the
dialog is more entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   This week they were discussing the grand old American phrase
``ice cold brewskis and extra cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   What sounds to the colonists like the perfect menu for an
afternoon of TV football had the guardians of the Mother Tongue
wondering, ``How do you get pizza out of that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans wondered, ``What, they put cheese in their beer
over there?''
</P>
<P>
   The Brits countered, ``What, you've never heard of a pizza
without cheese?''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Queen's children drift further apart. Or farther, if
you consider continental drift, because everyone in
alt.usage.english knows that ``further'' expresses degree while
only ``farther'' expresses distance.
</P>
<P>
   In other groups, these were some of the themes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Old friends in misc.rural were discussing what to do with
frozen water pipes and how to control those field mice that come
into the house in winter. The crops are in, obviously. The
contributors had time to revive their old joke thread about
``yupnecks,'' their term for exurban gentry who commute to necktie
jobs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   You could be a yupneck if you spent $300 for a designer goat and
he ate your $5,000 landscaping job around the barn. Or if your
sushi bar is also a bait shop. Or if you like everything about the
country but the people, the smell, and the music.
</P>
<P>
   _ In alt.quotations, the argument was about Kahlil Gibran, a
poet whose fame soared in the 1960s because he was from India and
hippies thought that was a center of knowledge until they noticed
the Indians hadn't found a bed for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hear a line of his work without flinching,'' a
contributor said. ``Wherein is he deemed a poet, or his works
poetry? How did he ever manage to get published, let alone famous?
In what way is his poetry more profound than a Barbie doll...?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, relax,'' another offered. ``Nobody reads Gibran any more
anyway. Gone, along with Rod McKuen, and Maxwell Anderson, and the
use of the words `ambience' and `charisma,' and pop art, and
12-tone music.''
</P>
<P>
   There were parodies of Gibran in the thread too: ``Even the best
of friends cannot attend each other's funeral'' and ``I have seen
the future and it is just like the present, only longer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The group alt.quotations gets a lot of traffic, serving people
in the world who don't write their own epigrams.
</P>
<P>
   G.K. Chesterton's line sometimes comes up at newspaper watering
holes: ``Journalism largely consists in saying `Lord Jones Dead' to
people who never knew that Lord Jones was alive.'' But unless they
read alt.quotations, most crusty reporters probably didn't know
Chesterton said it.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked the source of this quote: ``It was a bright cold
day in April and the clocks were striking 13''
</P>
<P>
   Came the answer: ``1984, by George Orwell.'' Then one imagines a
thoughtful interval, followed by the addendum, `` ... Why do you
ask?''
</P>
<P>
   _ How about those never-happy denizens of soc.history.what-if,
always arguing alternate timelines, like what if Napoleon had won
at Waterloo or if Robert E. Lee had brought elephants to
Gettysburg?
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    After a couple of hours of watching the recent impeachment
debate in Congress, I wondered if I was watching Christian
television instead of C-SPAN.
 &HT;    In a day of speeches, House members pontificated on the Bible
nearly as much as they addressed the Constitution.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, congressional Bible-quoting fell along
strictly partisan lines. Republicans most often cited Old Testament
moral prohibitions -- especially the Ten Commandments. Democrats
favored the New Testament. They frequently quoted Jesus: ``Judge
not, lest you be judged'' and ``Let he who is without sin cast the
first stone.''
 &HT;    This biblical partisanship reflects deep divisions in our
nation's theological consciousness. Republicans, whose public
theology is largely shaped by conservative Christianity, tend to
depict God as a wrathful deity. Democrats, whose civic piety is
determined by religious liberalism, preach a God of love.
 &HT;    When looking to scripture to support public religious
pronouncements, Republicans turn toward the stern God of the Old
Testament. Democrats find the forgiving Jesus of the New Testament
more appealing. One side warns of judgment, the other proclaims
mercy.
 &HT;    Accordingly, God either wants Bill Clinton condemned or welcomed
home like the Prodigal Son. Since the Republicans hold the
majority, God-as-Judge won in the House of Representatives.
 &HT;    This is, however, problematic. Public theology is about as
textured as a piece of typing paper. Bible-spouting aside, most
congressional representatives proved themselves lousy theologians
in this argument.
 &HT;    During the debate, Congress fell for the oldest trick in the
book: dividing God into neat categories of justice and mercy. In
the second century, a church leader named Marcion argued much the
same thing -- that the New Testament taught a Gospel of Love over
and against the Old Testament's wrathful God.
 &HT;    Other Christians rejected this view, insisting instead on a
fundamental unity between the two testaments. The God of the Old
Testament and the God of the New are, in spite of the theological
disagreements between Jews and Christians, the same God.
 &HT;    Although this position became orthodoxy, Christian tradition
continued to struggle with the tension between God's justice and
love. For most of its history, the church has tended to emphasize
God's justice over God's mercy. Very few Christians understand the
orthodox position: God is both just and merciful at the same time.
 &HT;    In the 16th century, the problem of justice and mercy tormented
the Protestant reformer Martin Luther. Convinced he would be
rightly damned for his sins, Luther could not conceive of a loving
God. Indeed, Luther said he hated God because of God's unrelenting
justice.
 &HT;    After years of prayer and study, Luther realized that God is,
indeed, just. But God's justice is not distant and condemning
judgementalism that sends sinners to hell. Rather, God justifies
humankind through grace. Luther became convinced that God's justice
is God's grace that justifies -- ``makes right'' -- humanity. God
does not condemn. God makes us holy -- no matter how bad or sinful
we have been.
 &HT;    Luther's theological realization, referred to as the Lutheran
paradox, is the heartbeat of biblical faith. The Old Testament God
is not a wrathful judge. Rather, throughout scripture God is a
wooing lover calling creation into union with the divine presence.
Justice melts into mercy; and vengeance belongs only to God's
mysterious providence. God's justice is God's love; God's love is
God's justice.
 &HT;    What has all this to do with Bill Clinton and Congress? Plenty.
God's justice is that God loves Bill Clinton, Ken Starr -- all
those desperate Democrats and those mean Republicans alike. And
God's love is that none of them know -- or begin to understand --
the counsels of God. Whatever they do, is ultimately nothing. It
is, as the Old Testament teaches, ``The flower that fades, the
grass that withers.'' Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
 &HT;    However relevant this paradox may be, public theology can never
embrace it. By its nature, civic piety demands clarity. So,
Bible-quoting politicians proclaim they know the mind of God.
Condemn with glee. Forgive and forget. Paradox can not exist in
this clear-cut, vote-counting world.
 &HT;    Watching the president, however, on the White House lawn after
the vote, I thought: ``This man finally understands.'' Clinton said
nothing glib that Saturday afternoon. He was, in effect, without
words.
 &HT;    But for those with eyes to see, God's justice was momentarily
visible. Throughout, Hillary held his hand. It was not public
theology; it was the mystery of love. The paradox of the one most
wronged still standing with her beloved.
 &HT;    A wife and her errant husband. God and straying humanity. Mercy
redeems sin. Hillary Clinton, rather than a scripture-spouting and
self-righteous Congress, embodies biblical virtue.

</P>
<P>
   You may be familiar with the inspirational writing called The
Desiderata. Although the entire writing is exquisitely presented,
one statement in particular can be quite beneficial. It states,
``Go placidly amid the noise and the haste.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be particularly relevant to life in a big city, with
all its hustle, rush, and sometimes confusion, and equally
meaningful for smaller towns and areas when we seem to get caught
up in the ``busyness'' of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   An important thing to remember is that whatever kind of
confusion may be around you, what is within your own consciousness
is what counts. And you have available two of the most powerful
tools to use -- love and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hebrew greeting ``Shalom,'' a beautiful and meaningful word,
means ``surrender.'' We may have often thought of surrender as
connoting coming to the end of a struggle, such as a war or some
major dispute or conflict. To say, ``Oh, I give up,'' may seem to
indicate futility and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oriental idea of surrender is quite different. It is
that which comes first. It is a spiritual state that establishes
harmony and brotherhood and oneness with other people and
conditions. What more meaningful way can we bring this feeling of
oneness about than through love and prayer!
</P>
<P>
   In the New Testament, Jesus admonishes his followers to ``become
as little children'' and to ``love your enemies.'' Probably no two
commands may be more difficult to follow in today's world,
confronted as sometimes happens with our own negative thoughts,
whether in business, within our family, or among our friends.
</P>
<P>
   It may be easy to look at a negative example set by others and
shrug off our responsibility to ``love one another,'' even as God
has loved us. We might use the excuse that if no one else follows
these spiritual principles, why should we? And yet, throughout
history, it seems almost impossible not to notice the success of
those who have acted on the courage of their convictions to ``love
thy neighbor as thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some in modern times who, if asked how to handle a
difficult relationship, may respond by saying, ``Just tell them you
love them.'' Mother Theresa, as she lived out these spiritual
principles of love in her own life, declared that ``love for God is
love in action.'' She stated, ``loving Him through words is not
enough,'' and she showed her love for God through a lifetime of
dedicated work with the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sets the Mother Theresas of the world apart is
their ability to enjoy the ``fruits of the Spirit,'' as described
by St. Paul after his conversion to Christianity on the road to
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Most people now understand the term ``the laws of nature,'' the
multitude of principles discovered by scientists, primarily in the
last four centuries, explaining or describing the physical
universe.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone yet understands the phrase ``the laws of
the spirit.'' There is a difference between laws of the spirit and
religious laws such as those formulated by Moses, Hammurabi,
Muhammad, and other ancient lawgivers.
</P>
<P>
   More benefits may result in the domains of the spirit if each
individual drew up his own personal list of the laws governing
spiritual matters. It may be that when we understand and claim as
our own some actual laws of the spirit-such as love and prayer-that
we begin to build our own heaven.
</P>
<P>
   As the anthropologist Margaret Mead states in her book
``Twentieth Century Faith,'' ``Each man is indeed his brother's
keeper and the need to love our enemies ought to be given new
scientific meaning. If only we are able to love those who are our
enemies, in the sense of cherish and protect, can we hope to
protect the lives of men and the life of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Once we understand how to express this love to others through
our own lives, we may then be better able to direct our prayers to
make God's priorities our own. As we learn to share and give and
care, love increases.
</P>
<P>
   A person who knows how to love does not seem to feel lonely or
alone. In this sense, the power of love can become a true weapon
against harm.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend of mine is fond of saying, ``Love given is love
received,'' and happiness is a by-product of that kind of love.
This law of life, when put to use through loving expressions and
prayer, can guide us in fulfilling our every aspiration, as well as
enriching the lives of those around us.

GAME RATING SYSTEM STILL GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO GORE
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS  
 c.1998 CyberTimes 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While supporters and critics of the electronic game industry
agree that the voluntary rating system used for video and computer
games generally works well, a new report suggests that some
publishers may be undermining the ratings, by marketing games
featuring gore and violence to children barely out of their Sesame
Street years.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict became apparent this month (December), after the
release of the fourth annual ``Video and Computer Game Report
Card'' issued by a media watchdog group, the Minneapolis-based
National Institute on Media and the Family. The report was unveiled
at a news conference with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat, who helped push for the industry to adopt its voluntary
rating system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report was timed for the onset of the busy
holiday game-buying season; overall, the industry is expected to
record about $6 billion in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a combination of telephone interviews with parents,
visits to game retail and rental outlets and inspections of about
90 games, the report card offered word of some positive
developments for parents concerned about games that emphasize
violence and offensive themes, finding that the rating system is
generally working well.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings appeared on virtually all the video and computer game
boxes examined for the report, and the researchers generally agreed
with the ratings assigned to the games -- seven categories ranging
from ``early childhood'' to content suitable for ``adults only.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report found that the ratings have not proved
altogether successful in keeping children away from graphic
content.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the report indicated that too few parents know
about or use the ratings. A national telephone survey of 529
parents conducted this summer by the National Institute on Media
and the Family found that only about 40 percent routinely checked a
game's rating when making a purchase. Another problem, the group
found, is that few retailers have policies in place to discourage
children from buying games rated for the older crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report charged that a small group of game makers
and distributors is marketing games to a younger-than-appropriate
age group. ``We are not claiming it's widespread, but there are
examples and we are asking the industry to take a look at it,''
said David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited several examples of inappropriate marketing,
among them an advertisement for a game called Resident Evil 2 in
the magazine Sports Illustrated for Kids. The game, made by Capcom
Entertainment, carries an ``M'' rating, indicating it is
appropriate for those age 17 and above.
</P>
<P>
   But the advertisement in Sports Illustrated for Kids was for a
toned-down version of the game made by a different company, Tiger
Electronics Ltd., and adapted for hand-held units. This version
carries a ``T,'' rating, meaning it is suitable for those 13 and
older, said Sandra M. Schneider, vice president of Tiger
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated for Kids, meanwhile, is aimed at 8- to
14-year-olds, and about half of its readership is older than 12,
said Tracey Vogt, a spokeswoman for the company. Magazine officials
saw little that was inappropriate in the advertisement itself and
felt the product was targeted at a good portion of the
publication's readership.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh found those arguments unconvincing, suggesting that many
parents would not distinguish between the various versions of the
game. He also said he is concerned that the advertisement could
whet the appetite of the magazine's younger readers for the more
violent version of the game. ``They use products that would gain
the attention of kids to sell products that are not supposed to be
sold to kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry representatives insist that matters are not as
simple as presented in the study, and that game marketing is
generally appropriately targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, which represents 41 major game publishers,
said that it is impossible for publishers ``to create an airtight
system'' to prevent children from ever being exposed to advertising
for games aimed at an older market.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein stressed that he is not defending some of the
advertisements in the industry, which prominently highlight the
goriest aspects of violent games. Nonetheless, he says there are
other brakes on children's access to arguably inappropriate
material that the report card fails to consider.
</P>
<P>
   One is that increasingly, the players themselves are older, and
that computer games are now often played by adults, not just young
boys. Another, he said, is that buyers of the items are usually
adults, because few children have the $50 or so available to buy
the games.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh remains skeptical and says it is children, in many cases,
who buy the games. His assessment of this year's report is that it
contains both good news and bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been progress in a lot of areas, and there are some
concerns in others,'' he said.

WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
  By TODD PITOCK 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, as the infamous British nanny case made front-page
news, my wife and I began looking for childcare. Despite the
negative press, choosing an au pair seemed like the best option for
our family. If nothing else, a year of living with a stranger would
be an adventure for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   What we found, adventure aside, was that much could be learned
from our relationship with our au pair. I came to this conclusion
one Saturday when, a little past noon, my 2-year-old son threw a
major fit. He lay on the floor, outraged and bereft, his face
hidden in his arms. I knelt beside him and offered lunch, milk and
the $23 I had in my pocket. ``You know, Jeremy,'' I sighed, ``this
isn't what I had in mind for our afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a voice from above called out to me: ``Offer him a
cheese stick!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I thought, heavenly advice. Soon, there was peace in our
house.
</P>
<P>
   The voice belonged to our German caregiver, Kathrin (Ka-treen).
It was simultaneously disconcerting and reassuring to think that in
eight months, she'd acquired a better sense of how to handle
Jeremy's tantrums than I had.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Toni, was in graduate school when Jeremy was born, and
we found ourselves in a common predicament over childcare. Our
4-year-old daughter, Elyse, was in preschool Monday through Friday,
but we needed a full day's supervision for Jeremy and occasional
evenings for both kids. Cost was an issue, as was flexibility. Our
schedules shifted according to my unpredictable project deadlines
and the demands of Toni's academic workload.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, we wanted nurturing, consistent, one-on-one care
for Jeremy, in our house, from a caregiver whom we could train and
supervise. In our experience with daycare, which we'd used
part-time for a few months, the staff turnover rate was high, and
we wanted Jeremy to have more stability.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we opted for an au pair, a young foreign woman from
one of six U.S. government-regulated agencies, who would live with
us for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Toni and I were scrupulous about finding the right person. We
chose an agency that asked detailed questions on its application
about the au pair's background and interests. We made up our own
questions, too, already knowing the answers we wanted, to make sure
the candidate was a solid match.
</P>
<P>
   Then we placed our overseas call to interview 19-year-old
Kathrin, the prospective au pair with whom we'd been matched by the
agency. In the conversation, we posed ``what if'' scenarios to test
Kathrin's responses on various childcare issues. Toni asked how
Kathrin's parents felt about her going abroad for a year. Hearing
they were worried (they were) would indicate that she came from a
nurturing family.
</P>
<P>
   As a final question, Toni inquired, ``How should children be
disciplined?'' ``According to the parents' beliefs.'' Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Kathrin's arrival, six weeks before Toni's fall
semester began, allowed us time to observe her with the kids and
gave her a chance to model our parenting style. During the first
days, we discussed expectations on both sides. Elyse was excited by
the prospect of having a ``big sister,'' and Jeremy instantly took
to our new helper.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges were immediately apparent. The only room
available for her was the one right next to ours. Suddenly, our
personal space constricted. The house became somewhat more formal.
No more flopping in front of the TV set in my favorite ragged
pajamas. But that was implicit in the choice of having live-in
help. We all adjusted. I learned to wear a robe.
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier was greater than we'd anticipated. Toni,
who is a South African immigrant, and I had both lived in
non-English speaking countries and understood how overwhelming it
is to have words coming at you like freeway traffic, so we did our
best to speak slowly. Kathrin, determined to learn, studied her
palm-size German-English dictionary every night. Her discipline
paid off, and within weeks, she improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
   The children were the main issue. After the initial excitement
wore off, Elyse resisted the alien authority figure in ``her''
house. The result was erratic emotions, from love to hate,
sometimes within a bewildering stretch of 10 minutes. Kathrin, an
experienced daytime baby sitter but here clearly out of her depth,
was confused, irritated and unequipped. She compared Elyse with
Jeremy, generally an easygoing 16-month-old, and decided that Elyse
was ``difficult.'' When we explained that Jeremy was simply
younger, that Elyse had also been pliant at his age and was still a
happy 4-year-old, Kathrin did not look completely convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Toni and I began to hold weekly family meetings to discuss what
was working and what wasn't. Here, Elyse and Kathrin expressed
themselves gently but directly. Elyse needed to know that she could
articulate her feelings. Otherwise, they'd turn into tears of rage,
which in turn would provoke Kathrin. Given a chance to speak up,
Elyse felt her power restored.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Kathrin grew into her role. She continued to favor
Jeremy, though not at the expense of Elyse. Because Elyse was in
school, Kathrin spent more time with our son. She also came to know
him at an earlier stage of his life, learned the rhythms of his
moods as he developed, and moved in sync with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrin's relationship with the kids, Toni, and me was hard to
pin down. Kathrin was not quite family, but she wasn't just an
employee, either. One of the most challenging aspects of living
with Kathrin was when she was off duty. Sometimes she seemed like a
mature young woman who was nearly our contemporary; other times she
was like a teenager thrusting us into a stage of parenthood for
which we weren't ready.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of instances, such as a series of successive late
nights that had her falling down on the job, required that Kathrin
and I have a ``chat.'' Thereafter, we agreed to a midnight curfew
on workdays. We could also see that she needed more time off, and
we agreed to give her alternate weekends. It was a case of
enlightened self-interest. This way, we could ask her to put in
longer hours on days when our schedules got particularly hectic.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrin was clever and innovative when it came to playing with
the kids. I arrived home one afternoon to discover she'd turned the
entire basement into an indoor playground. An old blanket and two
cardboard boxes were transformed into a bedouin-style tent, and
Jeremy's cars and trains formed a little transport system
underneath, much to his delight. Not only did Kathrin seem to enjoy
playing with the kids, she knew how to do it at their level.
</P>
<P>
   As Kathrin's yearlong stay drew to a close, she said she had no
regrets. ``I learned a lot,'' she told me, ``But if I had total
choice, I would rather be an exchange student than an an pair.''
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. Critics of the au pair program point this
out as its quintessential flaw. When the host family is looking for
childcare and the au pair is looking for an American adventure,
such mismatched expectations can lead to unhappy pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Kathrin's departure, Toni and I decided not to apply
immediately for another au pair. We didn't want to bring someone
into the children's lives, only to replace the relationship on a
yearly basis. We also had the luxury of time. Toni had finished her
graduate studies and was pregnant again, so she would be at home.
</P>
<P>
   We talked with our children about Kathrin's leaving. We drew
maps and pictures, explaining where she would be going. Jeremy, not
quite 2 1/2, needed the preparation. When he heard the word
leaving, he reflexively offered to go along for the ride, for fear
of being left behind. This was one ride, we explained, he couldn't
go on. Although sad, he brightened somewhat when Toni reassured him
that neither she nor I would be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Kathrin's absence was harder for Elyse, who
had overcome her early resistance and grown attached to her
caregiver. A few outbursts prompted us to discuss Kathrin's
departure, talking with Elyse about how it made her feel. Slowly,
we all adjusted to life as it was before having an au pair.
</P>
<P>
   After Kathrin left, the house assumed its former dimensions. The
robe returned to the closet, and I once again flopped, pajama-clad,
in front of Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Toni and I missed the extra help, and we
were so far out of the baby-sitting loop that we didn't know where
to begin. Kathrin herself had been part of our life for a year,
sharing everything from dinnertime discussions to family outings.
It was only natural, then, that for a while, we all had a sense
that someone was missing.

WHY MONEY WON'T BUY FAT 
 BY ATUL GAWANDE, M.D.
</HEADLINE>
  c.1998 Slate (www.slate.com 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a job like mine, in which a reasonably broad swath
of American society presents itself to you without any clothes on,
this question no doubt has popped into your head: Why are the poor
so fat? That obesity is a characteristic problem of affluent
countries surprises no one. But why is it also characteristic that
obesity increases so dramatically as you go down the social scale?
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not the case in developing nations. In
countries such as India, where my parents emigrated from, being
overweight is directly related to wealth and status and is regarded
as attractive. Thus, my father's rural family of farmers is thin
and wiry, while the elders in my mother's urban clan of higher
caste and wealthier stock are as plump as can be. When my sister
and I, two scrawny specimens of the American ``upper-middle
class,'' visit, we always evoke a good deal of concern from
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The first report I found to document the effect class has on
obesity was a 1965 study of midtown Manhattan residents. The
researchers found obesity was six times more common among women in
the bottom third of the social scale than among those in the top
third. Subsequent studies, orginating from California to New
Zealand, confirm these findings. In a 1996 study in Minnesota's
Twin Cities, women earning under $10,000 a year weighed, on
average, 20 pounds more than women earning over $40,000 a year. In
advanced nations, low income is a more powerful predictor of
obesity than any single factor except age, though this relationship
is weaker in men than in women. In men, height is associated more
strongly with status. On average, in developed and undeveloped
countries alike, richer men are taller.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think weight would be like height. More money means more
food. So more food should mean more fat, just as it means more
height, right? And, in fact, in children this is exactly the
case--at young ages, certainly under age 6 in the United States,
lower-income kids are less likely to be obese than higher-income
kids. By the time they are adults, however, the relationship has
inverted.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? As my epidemiologist friends point out to me,
when two things correlate, there are always three possible
explanations. One leads to the other. The other leads to the one.
Or some third thing is driving both.
</P>
<P>
   The downward mobility hypothesis. One possibility is that
obesity leads to lower income. Certainly the obese, particularly
obese women, face severe disadvantages in both the job and marriage
markets. And the evidence that this produces downward mobility is
distressingly strong. Almost half the women in the 1965 Manhattan
study belonged to a different social class than their parents, and
those who had moved down were significantly fatter than those who
had moved up. More recently, a landmark national study led by
Steven Gortmaker, a Harvard researcher, tracked over 8,000 people
from age 18 to 25. It found the heaviest 5 percent of women were
half as likely to get married and twice as likely to become
impoverished as others. Obesity affected a woman's economic
prospects more than even chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   In men, however, shortness led to downward mobility. One foot
less of height doubled a man's likelihood of poverty. But as
Gortmaker points out, downward mobility explains only a small part
of the observed relationship of income to obesity. That makes
sense. After all, the gap also exists in countries such as Britain,
where social class is more rigid than it is here.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic explanation. Could genetics be an outside factor
driving both obesity and poverty? The so-called ``Danish adoption
study'' lent some credence to the idea, finding that the obesity
and social status of adoptees depended on the social status not
only of their adoptive parents but also of their biological
parents. The study inferred that parents can give their offspring
genetic traits that tip the scales toward both heavier weight and
lower status. Even so, inheritance accounted for at most a small
part of the stark effect of income on obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The gluttony and sloth hypothesis. So downward mobility and
genes matter somewhat but, ultimately, we're left with the obvious
explanation that in affluent societies the lower the income, the
more people eat unhealthily, sit around, or both. Unfortunately,
measuring this directly is notoriously difficult. Most
people--especially the obese--fib about diet and exercise and, when
observed, tend to change their behavior. The differences you're
looking for are also quite small--a single calorie of extra daily
intake starting in childhood can translate into 10 extra pounds by
the time you're 25. Nonetheless, there's a good deal of indirect
evidence--for example, TV watching is linked to eating more and
exercising less, and rises substantially as income lowers. Given
the weakness of other explanations, few experts doubt that
lifestyle is the most important one.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why. It's as if avoiding obesity were enormously
expensive. But it's not--exercise is free, and eating less junk
food and meat and more produce saves money. Rather, for the 30
percent to 70 percent with a genetic predisposition to obesity,
it's just horrendously difficult. Being motivated is vital, and
motivation is what seems to differ by class.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Twin Cities study, for example, found marked
differences in weight concern. Although women earning under $10,000
were no less successful when they dieted than women earning over
$40,000, they were one-third less likely to diet in the first
place. They had a greater tolerance for weight gain, saying it
would take a 20 pound gain before they took action, as opposed to
the 10 pound gain that would trigger action in higher-income women.
They even weighed themselves less often (three times a month vs.
seven times a month).
</P>
<P>
   This cultural-differences explanation certainly accounts for why
anorexia nervosa is mainly a disease of higher-income girls and
young women. Since obese men are less stigmatized, it may also
explain why wealthier men are not that much less obese than poorer
men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if thinness really becomes the ideal in every affluent
culture--the way plumpness is in poor societies--it's curious. Is
this simply the nature of status--the rich will always find a way
to distinguish themselves from the poor? Or does richness breed an
instinct for longevity? Whatever the case, I'll know India has
finally risen from Third World status when I go back to visit my
relatives and the first few words they say are not ``Eat, eat,
skinny boy.''

TEA FOR LIFE

<P>
   A cup of tea keeps the doctor away? Don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A symposium this fall (1998) in Washington heard evidence that
this 5,000-year-old beverage has health benefits beyond a warm,
contented feeling and a gentle caffeine buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that
tea is an important source of antioxidants, those chemicals that
keep oxygen and nitrogen compounds from damaging cells, thus
slowing the aging process and preventing some diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A typical cup of black tea _ the kind most Americans drink _
contains more antioxidants than some fruits and vegetables. Teams
from the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the Chinese Academy of
Preventative Medicine discussed findings that tea-drinking may
reduce the risk of some kinds of cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some evidence from the Netherlands that chemicals
in tea can lower levels of ``bad'' cholesterol in the bloodstream,
which might prevent heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   All this good news needs to be taken with a grain of, er, sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium was sponsored and publicized by the Tea Council of
the USA, an association of tea businesses and importers. Below the
headlines, scientists indicated that most of their theories needed
much more research for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Still the possibility of health benefits justifies a second look
at a drink whose popularity crosses the boundaries between dozens
of cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, Americans drink enough tea to fill 160,000
backyard swimming pools, with plenty of pitchers to spare,
according to the Tea Council. Roughly half of Americans are
tea-drinkers, with the South and New Englanders downing far more
than their share.
</P>
<P>
   According to sociologist John Shelton Reed, 87 percent of
Southerners say they drink tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink tea every day,'' said Moyra Stevens, a Scotswoman now
living and gardening in Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Down South, of course, ``tea'' usually means sugared iced tea;
two-thirds of Southerners say they prefer their brew sweet, and
they drink it year-round, even in the depth of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Such a widespread habit _ novelist Reynolds Price says iced tea
is as essential to the Southern lunch as fried chicken, cured ham
or green beans _ was formed surprisingly recently.
</P>
<P>
   Official histories credit British promoter Richard Blechynden
with inventing iced tea in 1904, meeting the demand for a cool
nonalcoholic beverage at the St. Louis World's Fair that year.
</P>
<P>
   Food chronicler John Egerton, however, thinks cool tea might
have caught on in parts of the South in the late 1800s, as
commercial ice-making became more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everybody downs his or her tea cold, and Orange
Pekoe, the type preferred in most Southern kitchens, is just one of
thousands of varieties of tea worldwide. It's possible to grow as
snobbish about tea as many aficionados do about wines or cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung invented tea in
the year 2737 B.C., after some leaves floated into a pot of boiling
water. Other sources claim that tea was brought to China by
Buddhist missionaries from India. In any case, China and India
still lead the world both in tea production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Tea leaves come from a bush or shrub, a botanical cousin of the
camellia. The best teas grow in tropical regions on mountainsides
at elevations between 3,000 and 7,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Teas come in three major varieties: black, green or oolong.
Black teas, accounting for 95 percent of the tea drunk in America,
are produced by crushing the leaves, letting them ferment under
special conditions and then drying or oxidizing them in ovens.
Dried, the teas are black and powdery; steeped in boiling water,
they take a red or amber hue.
</P>
<P>
   Green teas, a specialty of China and Japan, are steamed and
crushed, without the oxidizing process. The resulting teas are
green or golden in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Oolong teas represent a sort of halfway point between black and
</P>
<P>
   green. The leaves are partially fermented, giving these teas a
greenish-brown color.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal teas, especially the decaffeinated brands, are not true
teas. They are ground from the flowers, leaves, peels, seeds and
other parts of plants and herbs such as chamomile, chrysanthemum,
thyme, peppermint, cinnamon or rosebud.
</P>
<P>
   TEA CEREMONIES
</P>
<P>
   Almost as important as the tea itself is the ritual behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan _ which acquired tea from a Buddhist monk named Yeisi
sometime in the 1100s _ the tea ceremony evolved into an elaborate
social grace, in which tea-drinking (precisely three sips, no more,
no less, from a tiny, exquisite cup) becomes almost an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, who picked up the habit in the 1700s, turned tea into
an excuse for animated conversation, generally centered around
their distinctive samovars (from a Russian word meaning, literally,
``self-boiler''). In Russia, tea is strongly sweetened with sugar,
honey or jam.
</P>
<P>
   The Western nation that took tea closest to its heart, however,
was Merry Old England. The brew began to appear in London in the
late 1600s, patronized by King Charles II, who picked up the tea
habit while in exile in Holland and who married a princess from
Portugal, the foremost tea importer of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, again, that particular English custom called ``tea'' is of
surprisingly recent vintage. History books attribute it to the
Duchess of Bedford (1788-1861), who needed an afternoon pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources credit the Industrial Revolution. Britons, then as
now, generally serve supper at 8 p.m. or even 9 p.m., Stevens
noted. The workers from the new factories of the 1800s and the
mines, however, needed some refreshment once their shifts ended
around 4 or 5 p.m. Thus, Stevens and millions of other Anglophiles
take a break around the world at 4 p.m. for a little tea with
perhaps a cookie or some cake. ``High tea'' takes on the character
of a small meal, often with roast beef, mashed potatoes and peas.
</P>
<P>
   The tea is always hot, even in the tropics: ``The heat actually
cools you down, strangely enough,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake novice tea-drinkers make, is not to heat the
water enough. For good tea, the water must boil, at a temperature
of at least 212 degrees; coffee-grade water, at 180 degrees or so,
will not do.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens always begins by warming her teapot, pouring in some
water from her electric kettle, swirling it around inside, then
pouring it out through the spout.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers loose tea, which involves such apparatus as a
tea-strainer or tea ball. However, Americans have generally
embraced the 1904 invention of tea dealer Thomas Sullivan, also
introduced at the St. Louis World's Fair _ the tea bag.

 &HT;    __ What do you give a man who has Alzheimer's disease? Ronald
Reagan's daughter gets an unexpected answer. __
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    Christmas is supposed to be about giving _ not so much the
material kind, but giving of the self, the soul, the heart. Giving
at any time is supposed to be about that, but it's easy to forget,
particularly at Christmas. The concept gets buried beneath Neiman
Marcus catalogues, lists, bills.
 &HT;    My grandmother understood the essence of giving and never forgot
it. In the '40s and '50s, Nelle Reagan regularly visited
tuberculosis patients at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar,
Calif. She had little money, but believed that giving to others is
a vital part of life. She always brought the patients something,
even if it was just a card or a pencil.
 &HT;    But when people close to you are ill, especially if death is
whispering in their ears, you want to give them impossible things _
more time, less pain, an escape from long nights of fear. A friend
of mine recently found out that cancer has conquered vast regions
of his body. His chemo treatments are a race against time. Many of
his nights are spent sitting in a chair, fighting pain.
 &HT;    ``It's so quiet then,'' he said. ``When it gets so late and
everyone's asleep.'' Alone with his pain and his fear, the hours
crawl slowly.
 &HT;    Although my father is not in pain, he loses more of himself each
month to Alzheimer's. For him, as for anyone who has this disease,
time is the enemy. It becomes jumbled, confused, compressed and
emptier all the time _ hollowed out.
 &HT;    My brother Michael and I meet at our father's office with gifts
for him _ ours and our brother Ron's. Ron wasn't sure when he'd be
down from Seattle and we wanted to give our gifts all at once. My
sister, Maureen, had made other arrangements for hers.
 &HT;    We have all thought along the same lines: What will he like to
look at, what will hold his attention or, even better, tug at his
imagination? We've brought picture books, mostly of nature scenes,
and chocolates _ a forbidden treat.
 &HT;    And a snow globe. When I saw it, I remembered that when I was a
child my father would describe white, snowy Christmases,
transporting me from the brilliant sunshine of a California
December. It seemed perfect to give him a miniature replica of
Christmas, a fantasy encased in glass.
 &HT;    My father's office is high above Los Angeles. Blue sky and
rooftops are the view from his windows. He still goes there for a
couple of hours on weekday mornings. There isn't much for him to
do, but that isn't the point. It's a routine, and with Alzheimer's
routines are important. They structure time, fill the hours.
 &HT;    There is something comforting about cluttering up his desk with
gifts and cards. These days, it's mostly empty. A yellow pad that's
never written on is always in the same place, and has been for
months. I watch his hands as he tries to be careful, peeling tape
from the wrappings. Then he just tears it, giving in to impatience,
perhaps. His eyes light up at the chocolates; for a moment, we're
co-conspirators, bringing him a delicacy he rarely gets.
 &HT;    ``Those are all for you, Dad,'' Michael tells him. ``You don't
have to share them with anyone.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, good,'' he says playfully, pulling them toward him.
 &HT;    He becomes engrossed in the books, the photographs of lakes and
meadows and mountains. He turns the snow globe and smiles at the
tiny winter wonderland. I tell him that when he tires of the
sunshine outside the window, he can just look into the snow globe
and change the season.
 &HT;    He looks straight into my eyes and says flatly, ``OK.''
 &HT;    And I wonder, as I often do, if he knows that sometimes I search
for amusing things to say to him.
 &HT;    I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving. And for the time we are there, so do
Michael and I. We are removed from the madness of shopping malls
and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

 &HT;    Israel's fate captures imagination of evangelical Christians
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names on a map of modern Israel ring with biblical
significance in the ears of American Christians. The ancient cities
and towns, mountains and rivers are the settings of the great
events of the life of Jesus Christ and his Old Testament
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For many conservative Christians, this identification has
translated into a strong support for Israel, even while they feel
obligated to try to convert Jews to Christianity. Sometimes
enthusiasm for Israel comes at the expense of their fellow
Christians of Palestinian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pro-Jewish, pro-Israel,'' said the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.,
and founder of Liberty University. ``I would say evangelicals are
the very best friends Israelis have in the whole world outside
their own family. Evangelicals are more committed to Israel than
some of the American Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   This commitment is rooted in years of Bible lessons, according
to the Rev. Timothy Weber, dean of Northern Baptist Seminary in
Lombard, Ill. ``I think at rock bottom, evangelicals care deeply
about Israel because they're steeped in the Bible,'' Weber said.
``So many evangelicals sat for years and years and years in Sunday
school rooms with Bible land maps on the wall and heard Bible story
after Bible story that, as a result, they have a proprietary
interest in Israel. In a way it belongs to them as much as to the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, among Israel's best-known supporters, cites the Old
Testament and world history as the basis for his support.
``Basically God promised to bless those who blessed the children of
Abraham and curse those who cursed Israel,'' he said. ``I think
history supports the fact that he has been true to his word. When
you go back to the pharaohs, the caesars, Adolf Hitler and the
Soviet Union, all those who dared to touch the apple of God's eye _
Israel _ have been punished by God. America has been blessed
because she has blessed Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell and some evangelical and Pentecostal Christians feel
a special tie with Israel not only because of the past but because
of the future. They see the land as ``ground zero'' for Jesus'
triumphant return to earth, as Weber describes it. They believe
Bible prophecy dictates that certain political and religious events
must occur in Israel to prepare the way for Jesus to come again,
and see recent history as steps toward the fulfillment of this
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelical Christians in America have thought for centuries
that the nation of Israel was especially chosen by God and the
return of the Jews to Palestine and the establishment of the nation
of Israel in 1948 is viewed as a significant event,'' religious
broadcaster and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson said.
``Perhaps more significant is the Six-Day War, beginning June 5,
1967, which resulted in the Jewish people for the first time in
almost 2,500 years having control of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson says the reclamation of Jerusalem by the Jews signals
the culmination of prophecy by Jesus quoted in the gospel of Luke,
which says ``Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles, until
the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (Luke 21:24, New Revised
Standard Version of the bible).''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The year) 1967 began what I could call the generation of the
end of the Gentiles,'' Robertson said. ``That terminates in 2007.
That is an important 40 years in the history of the world as far as
I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson _ like most Christian leaders _ refuses to get into
specific predictions of when Jesus might reappear.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine of a second coming of Christ is not peculiar to
evangelicals. It is standard in both Catholic and Protestant
traditions. End-times events are so important to Christians that
the field of study has its own name _ eschatology. But within
Christianity, many different scenarios have developed for just how
the present world will end. Denominations have evolved from
people's acceptance of one view over another, and a whole
vocabulary has evolved to describe beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   What all the scenarios have in common is the pervasive belief
that Jesus' return will happen in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbolism is that his feet will stand on the Mount of
Olives,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tied to this belief is the political support for Israel to hang
on to its present boundaries and add more property. Historically,
say both Falwell and Robertson, the lands now called Gaza and the
West Bank were a part of the Promised Land God gave Abraham and his
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In insisting that Israel give land to Palestine to spur on the
peace process, ``the United States is on the wrong side,'' said
Robertson, who went on to warn that President Clinton could
``unwittingly begin a series of events that could lead to
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The final battle will be a fight over Jerusalem, Robertson said.
``It'll take place when the nations of the world come up against
Israel and try to take Jerusalem away ... The whole thought is that
when Jerusalem is under attack, Jesus will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The view that Israel is entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza
and complete control of Jerusalem puts evangelicals at odds with
some of their Christian brethren of Palestinian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the evangelicals believe they know what's going to
happen and they know the players in the end-time events, anything
that doesn't contribute to that scenario is outside the will of
God,'' Weber said. ``Palestinian Christians just don't factor in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent of Palestinians who are Christian frequently feel
neglected by their fellow believers, according to the Rev. Fahed
Abu-Akel, a Palestinian Christian and founder of Atlanta Ministry
with International students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians of Palestine and Israel feel forgotten by the
Christians of America,'' Abu-Akel said. ``Americans go there as
tourists and visit the place where Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
where he lived in Nazareth and was crucified in Jerusalem, and
focus on the past. They seldom get in touch with the living
Palestinian church today to see how they are doing, how they are
struggling and what are their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Abu-Akel said, ``American TV evangelists focus, most
of them, on Israel as a sign for the fulfillment of prophecy and
are completely insensitive to the issues of peace and justice and
the struggle of people for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians have found some support among mainline
Protestants. Because of the former British rule of Palestine, the
Anglican church is strong there. And Abu-Akel's denomination, the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is on record supporting a two-state
solution to conflict in the Middle East. ``That means an
independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christians who hold that view just don't take the Bible
seriously enough, Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably get more negative mail from Protestant and Catholic
Christians than I do from Arabs,'' he said. ``Most of them don't
believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. When you reject the
infallibility of scripture, then you can develop your own concepts
... Evangelicals, believing in the inerrancy of scripture, rather
choose literally to follow God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainline Protestants, Robertson said, ``regard Israel as just
one more country,'' while he and other evangelicals ``think of the
Jews as the chosen people of God and the return of the Jews to
their land as a matter of great significance from a Biblical
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians and their supporters lack the
communication infrastructure of either the government of Israel
with its consulates and ministry of tourism, or the American
evangelical and Pentecostal Christians with their television
ministries, Abu-Akel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the conservative Christians who offer Israel
unflinching support are also the most likely to feel the need to
convert the Jews to Christianity. At the very least, they believe
that Israel will go through continued tribulation and eventually
recognize Jesus as the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is very, very complicated,'' Weber said.
``Most evangelicals who are politically involved in the support of
Israel have learned they've got to tone down the evangelism. And
conversely, Jews who accept evangelical support have got to kind of
forget that they know the reason for all this evangelical interest
_ that Israel plays a role in end-time events which will lead to
the complete victory of Jesus Christ in the world.''

 &HT;    Christians a minority in land where Jesus dwelt
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, WEST BANK_Nisreen Zieneh isn't distracted by the
German tourists roaming about the cavernous Church of the Nativity
as she kisses her fingers and touches the low door frame of the
1,400-year-old basilica.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the church, believed by many Christians to be the
site of Jesus Christ's birth, the stylish young Arab woman kneels
and repeats the ritual, gently kissing her fingers and touching the
stone floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where Jesus was born. I came because I want to pray to
him. He stands beside me,'' Zieneh said.
</P>
<P>
   This day, Zieneh has two requests: That Jesus support her in her
law school examinations and that he forgive her for not visiting
the church since her wedding there six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the native Christians. Amid the more powerful
majorities of Jews and Muslims, it is Arab Christians who apply in
the modern world the religion that began here nearly 2000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But their numbers are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, political clout has determined the
subsistence of religion in the Middle East. Today, Christians are
without it, and in places like Israel, Egypt and Lebanon, they
suffer economic hardships and harassment because of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 6 million to 10 million Arab Christians
in the Middle East, about 5 percent of the population, according to
statistics at the Jerusalem-based Christian Information Center.
While exact figures are difficult to come by, experts agree the
population has slipped steadily over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem alone, the ratio of Christians to Muslims has
undergone a complete reversal in the past 50 years _ from a 70
percent majority of Christians at the end of World War II to a 30
percent minority today.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, some Arab Christian villages continue to thrive,
while others simply disappeared after the war that gave Israel its
independence in 1948. A tide of refugees, Christians and Muslims,
left Israel and later the West Bank and Gaza Strip when Israel
captured those territories in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel and the Palestinian-ruled territories _ home to
Jerusalem and Bethlehem _ Christians number fewer than 200,000
among a population of 5 million Jews and 2.5 million Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Christian schools are now mostly populated by Muslims, churches
are surrounded by mosques and synagogues. Christians emigrate
frequently to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons for the emigration are still there, in that
Christians are always going to be second-class citizens either in a
Jewish state or in a Muslim-majority state. They are never going to
be a force,'' said the Rev. Jerome Murphy O'Connor, a scholar at
the French Dominican School of Bible and Archaeological Studies in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A new trend in Bethlehem highlights the Christian predicament.
Over the last year, neon crucifixes have cropped up on a few
rooftops in this crowded city of 140,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rossing, former Israeli government liaison to the
Christian community, called the crosses an attempt at ``Christian
power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are between the hammer and the anvil,'' he said, in the
middle of the colossal struggle between the Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing historically after the Jews and before the Muslims,
Christians are like the overlooked middle child amid the region's
three faiths. But some Christians feel their religion's message may
be especially apt today, a period of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord's Prayer says to 'forgive their trespasses as you
would want yours to be forgiven,''' said Bernard Sabella, an expert
on the Christian population and a Christian Palestinian whose
family lost its house to Israel in 1948. ``I find it difficult to
apply this .. . it's difficult, but it's the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist. Relations between Jews, Muslims and
Christians remain strained.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial report, the Israeli government asserted
earlier this year that the new Palestinian National Authority
encourages Muslim persecution of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Mor, author of the report, says persecution is not overt.
But Muslims who desecrate churches or cemeteries are protected, he
said. Some who have converted from Islam to Christianity have been
harassed. He says Christians tell him privately that the
Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat, encourages their
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the politics of the region, Christians in Israel and
other Middle East countries have a support system that continues to
make them a major, if small, force in the region. They receive
millions of dollars in aid from Christians around the world, who
maintain about 700 churches, hospitals, schools and universities in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The local Christian community is a ragtag mix of ethnicity and
experience. There are Christian Palestinians who participated in
the anti-Israel Intifada uprising. Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs largely
stay out of the political fray. A Christian entrepreneur owns the
only Palestinian beer brewery, and another recently got the
franchise to produce Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   In Beit Jala, near Bethlehem, social worker Heyam Aldaqamqa at
the Evangelical Lutheran Church is hopeful that this land where
Jesus once walked will remain a spiritual center for Christians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Her church, founded more than 100 years ago, is heavily
supported by churches in Germany and has a congregation of about
500.
</P>
<P>
   Its modern wing has a boarding school for children from broken
homes _ Christian and Muslim. Aldaqamqa said the children share
their holidays and hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one people,'' she said. ``We are Palestinians and we
have the same destiny.

 &HT;    Few remain to speak `the Lord's language'
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They still speak the language of Jesus Christ, but
few are left in the land where Jesus once walked.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian Orthodox Christian community is so small that
observers question whether its traditions will continue to exist
here.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Damascus, Syria, communities of followers can be found
from Iraq to New Jersey. But what's left now in the land where
Jesus lived is a tight-knit, highly skilled community of between
1,500 to 3,000 in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Should this group disperse, the Holy Land would be a little less
Christian _ and a lot less colorful.
</P>
<P>
   They are known for their ancient language, which they chant in
church and that older Syrian Orthodox still speak in their homes.
They are famous for their bagpipe parades, which they began a few
decades ago just to get some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition is essential in a region where religion is the most
important factor in peoples' identity. It usually determines with
whom they socialize and to whom they can turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a deacon (in the church) but I am not religious. I have
to be involved in the church. It's a presence,'' said Syrian
Orthodox Elia Ahou, 39. ``You have to show that there are some
people in the community. We have to fight for our presence as
Syrians, and as Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahou, an assistant hotel manager, sees his community facing a
squeeze similar to other Christians, a small minority in a land
dominated by Muslims and Jews. But, unlike other churches, the
Syrian Orthodox own little church land and have few institutions to
call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they are fighting for Jerusalem, the Muslims and the
Jews, and we are left with nothing,'' he said. ``At least we have
the holy sites, which show that we are part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of Jerusalem's Syrian Orthodox community is its
St. Mark's Monastery, with a small, elegant church that is located
over what they believe was the house of the Virgin Mary and the
site of the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the daily Mass at the Church of St. Mark, surrounded since
the 1967 war by Jewish housing in Jerusalem's walled Old City, and
the clergy might outnumber the congregants. Their ceremony can seem
stern and intimidating. They chant in Aramaic and the bearded
clergy wear tight black hoods embroidered with small white crosses
for each of the 12 apostles.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward even a stranger might be able to sip tea in the
courtyard with the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, several dozen show up at their cave-like chapel
behind the tomb of Christ in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. It
is one of several chapels within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Some Syrian Orthodox speak in Aramaic. Sounding a little like
Hebrew, this is a modern form of the classic language spoken
throughout the Middle East in Jesus' time. Like a few other
denominations, the Syrian Orthodox speak the classic Aramaic in
their church ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Orthodox consider their ethnicity as Aramaean and Syrian
and say their lineage goes back to Abraham. Many note that, as they
were born here, they are also Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian heyday in Jerusalem may have been during the Crusader
reign starting in 1099. What is now known as the Jewish Quarter of
the Old City was then called the Syrian Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1915, there may have been 1,000 families in Jerusalem
alone. Now, there are maybe 150 families here and possibly 500 in
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Sabella, a researcher who made the last comprehensive
count of Christians here, doubts even those figures. He put the
total number of Syrian Orthodox at about 1,500 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Emigration has taken its toll as the Syrian Orthodox escape the
troubled region. Like other Christians, they lost land and houses
to Israel in the 1948 and 1967 wars. The economy has been
perennially depressed. The last Syrian Orthodox school in Jerusalem
closed in 1967 and the last one in Bethlehem closed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially tempting for Syrian Orthodox to leave. Most have
dozens of family members in other countries. Each speaks several
languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough potential in this country,'' said Johnny
Goric, a 25-year-old Syrian Orthodox who speaks six languages and
is the executive chef at a foreign consulate.
</P>
<P>
   He has decided to stay and heads the Syrian Orthodox Club, which
provides activities for young members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Orthodox hopes are pinned on the celebrations for the
millennium, when followers from around the world will be encouraged
to visit. They will try to raise money for a 40-unit housing
project and a program to spread Aramaic, or ``the Lord's language''
among their young people _ most of whom have given up the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot guarantee that what you feel in your heart you can
transfer to the next generation,'' said Jack Khazmo, an organizer
of the effort.

THE THEFT OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Young people know everything. Middle-aged people
suspect everything. But too many old people believe anything, and
rip-off artists know that.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they can prey so effectively on the elderly. Con
specialists know that older folks came of age in a gentler time,
before the world overflowed with grifters and scammers bent on
separating them from their money.
</P>
<P>
   Roger's mother found that out the hard way. I won't give you her
full name, because I don't want to embarrass her. I won't give you
Roger's full name, either, because then somebody could figure out
his mother's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But I offer this story as a cautionary tale of our times, both
for guys like Roger and people like his mother, too. Always
remember that trust is like love _ to be given of sparingly and
only with great care.
</P>
<P>
   Roger is a commercial real estate developer. He works all up and
down the East Coast. He grew up on a farm near Albany. His mother
is a widow in her 80s, a delightful lady and not without some
business experience of her own. But she had this coin collection
she'd put together over the years, and not long ago she was
approached by some coin dealers from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of yours is worth a fortune, they assured her.
Let us handle its sale for you, and we'll make you rich. And
Roger's mother went along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Through a long, complicated scheme, the coin dealers managed to
separate her from her collection and from a rather large sum of
money. By the time Roger found out about it, the coin dealers were
nowhere to be found. He hired private detectives to gather evidence
and turned that evidence over to federal authorities. At least one
of these con artists had a criminal record, Roger has learned _ a
little bit of background that the guy had neglected to mention to
Roger's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The feds have reassured Roger that they'll eventually get these
people, although he's struck by what seems to him to be a rather
startling lack of outrage on their part. He supposes that's because
this sort of thing is so common now.
</P>
<P>
   Fully a fifth of the population is now composed of senior
citizens, more of them than ever with a little money they've
managed to set aside, and every year fraudulent telemarketers alone
take them for as much as $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What Roger can't figure out is how people can do things like
this, especially on so enormous a scale. How can human beings prey
so heartlessly on helpless old people, he wonders? And how can so
many other supposedly decent people take it all so much in their
stride?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we're allowing to happen to ourselves,'' he said the
other day. ``People are just too busy to think about it, I suppose
... The culture has just turned itself on its head. Good has been
redefined as bad. Bad has been redefined as cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know, you try to ground your kids and keep yourself
between the lines. And you look at what goes on around you, and you
say, `Gosh, how many people are paying attention?' What's the world
going to be like in another 20 years?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I know,'' I said. ``I see a lot more of it than most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing,'' Roger said. ``Years ago, the
measure of a man or woman was your integrity. That was what you
lived by and what you were known by. Now that's gone. Now it's all
what works, what feels good. And it can all be rationalized pretty
easily ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You really wonder when the wake-up call is going to be and how
people will respond.''

POPULAR DONOR EGG PROGRAMS RAISE SLEW OF ETHICAL QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wanted: healthy young women with eggs and time to
spare. In exchange, you can earn thousands of dollars from
infertile couples trying to have a baby of their own.
</P>
<P>
   As more couples seek options in their quest for parenthood,
clinics across the country are competing for young women to donate
their eggs. Some large infertility clinics in New York City and New
Jersey have even engaged in bidding wars, paying as much as $5,000
to recruit willing donors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the growing interest in donor egg programs is rejuvenating
the debate surrounding assisted reproduction technologies.
Physicians also worry about turning human eggs into a commercial
commodity, and the potential for exploiting financially strapped
young women looking to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely something that we're looking at,'' said Dr.
Jeanne Linden, director of the New York Blood and Tissue Resources
Program, a which regulates the licensing of ovum donor programs in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The number of babies born from donor eggs skyrocketed from 112
in 1989 to 1,743 in 1995, the most recent year data were available
from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who would say donor egg is ethically on the
brink,'' said Dr. Peter Horvath, the medical director at Albany IVF
Fertility and Gynecology, which pays donors $2,000. It is one of 17
programs in New York to recruit donors and harvest eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the concern focuses on payments and the medical risks
involved to the donor eggs. Donating eggs is more complex than
donating sperm, when men are generally paid $100 for their
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like going into the Red Cross and donating blood,''
said Dr. John Balint, director of the Center for Medical Ethics at
the Albany Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   Although laws in New York forbid the sale of human tissue, it is
acceptable to compensate donors for their time and inconvenience,
Linden said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for Reproductive Medicine's voluntary
guidelines say that egg donors ``may be reimbursed for the direct
and indirect expenses associated with their participation, and may
be compensated for their inconvenience, time, discomfort and risk
undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   To donate eggs, a woman has to inject herself with fertility
drugs for seven to 10 days to cause the ovaries to swell. During
that time, she must have frequent blood samples and sonograms to
assess the growth and development of the follicles, or clusters of
eggs in her ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   When the eggs are ready to harvest, the donor is given
anesthetics so that a physician can insert a needle and remove the
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more of a time commitment than some people are
anticipating,'' said Paula Taggart, the ovum donor coordinator at
Albany IVF.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart is looking only for non-smoking women under the age of
32 who have medical insurance. Infertile couples aren't interested
in women who are taking anti-depressants or who have a family
history of genetic disease. Older women pose a problem because
``any women over the age of 35, the quantity and quality of eggs
start to diminish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the clinic has approved two people to donate eggs.
Prospective donors must undergo a series of medical tests ruling
out problems such as HIV and hepatitis. Finally, only those donors
who pass a psychological screening will be put on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Most potential donors never make it past the first phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting donors is very challenging,'' Taggart said.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential complications of donating. Some women have
died from overstimulation of their ovaries. Others have had their
ovaries collapse, potentially affecting their own fertility. And
because many of the potent fertility drugs are still new, the
medical community is still uncertain of any long-term risks.
</P>

   Some physicians believe donor eggs raise too many questions for
both women who give them and the recipients, many of whom are in
their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   At Albany IVF, physicians have agreed only to use donor eggs in
women up to age 48 because of sticky questions surrounding the
artificial extension of motherhood. Some children have been born to
women in their 60s using donor eggs.

   ``There are no standards anywhere and the issue comes up, `Is it
fair for a child to be born to someone old enough to be their
grandmother?''' Balint said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also legal issues. How much information should donors
and recipients be given about one another? And what are the rights
of a child born from a donor egg to access pertinent genetic
information in the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a right or wrong about how you do
this,'' Balint said. ``There are a whole bunch of things out there
we have yet to resolve and that's what concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has no doubt what advice he'd give his daughter if she
ever contemplated becoming a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would discourage her because there are so many unknowns,''
he said. ``I don't think a well-off person with a good job would be
tempted to do this.''

LAWYER, RESIDENTS SEE TRUTH IN FILM'S PORTRAYAL

<P>
   Let's get a few facts straight about the new movie, ``A Civil
Action.'' Jan Schlichtmann's Porsche was not as cool-looking as the
one in the movie, and his office was on Broad Street, not tony
Charles Street at the foot of Beacon Hill. He doesn't look like
John Travolta, either.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlichtmann, the flamboyant lawyer portrayed by Travolta
who battled two major corporations over their role in poisoning
wells in Woburn, believes that ``A Civil Action'' is true on a
deeper level. It captures both the warlike atmosphere of his
lawsuit and the futility of counting on courts to provide justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments in the film . . . in which I felt the
emotions of that time,'' said Schlichtmann, who spent his law firm
into bankruptcy hoping for a big verdict against Beatrice Foods and
W. R. Grace &AMP; Co. ``I found myself really convulsed by the humor
and the irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action,'' which has its local premiere at Boston's
Wang Theatre on Jan. 6, tells the story of the bitter 1986 lawsuit
over the leukemia deaths of five children and one adult that family
members believed were caused by chemicals from Grace and Beatrice.
Far from winning a big verdict, Schlichtmann finally settled for $8
million from Grace and no admission of guilt by either firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Steven Zaillian, who won an Oscar for his
screenplay of ``Schindler's List,'' the moviemakers were concerned
with making a fair and realistic movie, bringing lawyers for both
sides to the set for advice and asking a federal lawyer for old
photos of her office to help recreate the mid-1980s offices of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann is particularly impressed with how realistic the
characters seem. Travolta plays him as a luxury-loving, obsessed
attorney whose singlemindedness makes the lawsuit possible but then
undermines efforts to win a favorable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And Schlichtmann doesn't disagree with the portrayal. ``Woburn
long ago put me in a position to be examined by many people from
many different angles. I'm used to it,'' he said. ``What I'm
impressed by is the integrity of the retelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Civil Action,'' based on the best-selling book of the
same name, is most concerned with the lawyers, employing the
environmental disaster as a backdrop against which Travolta and
Robert Duvall, as Beatrice's attorney Jerome Facher, fight their
legal grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nonlawyers _ the parents of the dead children,
neighborhood activists, and even the well-meaning government
regulators _ have a limited role, although their collective
efforts, spread over years and hundreds of meetings, finally
cleaned up Woburn's water.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Robbins, who initiated the Woburn lawsuit after her
9-year-old son died of leukemia, isn't even represented in the
movie, and one poignant line is spoken by another parent, Anne
Anderson, played by Kathleen Quinlan. In real life, Robbins had
said she would sit in the left-hand corner of the courtroom,
because as he lay dying her son promised to meet her in the
left-hand corner of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset when I saw it coming out of her mouth. . . . It
feels like they really stole part of my life away,'' said Robbins,
who, like many former plaintiffs who attended a private screening
last week, felt the movie was too short.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also simplifies a complicated pollution history to
keep the focus on Beatrice and Grace. In reality, the wells on the
Aberjona River were surrounded by industries that likely
contributed to the 56 chemicals found in the wells, which Woburn's
engineers cautioned against digging in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woburn is really the beginning of our industrial history. It
embodies the mistakes of individuals and government agencies and
industries, who, for many years, behaved very irresponsibly,'' said
Gretchen Latowsky, former director of For A Cleaner Environment,
which watchdogged the Woburn cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann says that the movie underscores one of the most
important lessons he learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was perpetuating the very evil that I was railing against,''
he said, looking back on the more than $10 million the adversaries
spent in legal combat. ``When we fight with each other over the
truth, we do not honor the truth.''

23-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Pa.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Two groups met one night to commit a simple felony:
trade cash for a truckload of stolen televisions. But, proving
there is no honor among thieves, a robbery ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The double cross was fatal to Nichola ``Nickie'' Morena, who
ended up with a bullet in his back. His death sent Robert Wideman
to prison for life, convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed like the end of a petty, pointless story. But last
month, 23 years after the shooting, Wideman won a new trial with an
incendiary argument: Morena's death was caused not by the bullet,
but by medical incompetence. The claim has enraged prosecutors and
Morena's family.
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying the conflict is the fact that Wideman's older
brother and chief supporter is the acclaimed author John Edgar
Wideman. His books include a searing account of Robert Wideman's
prison world, ``Brothers and Keepers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never stopped hoping, and my brother and I have never
stopped the struggle of trying to get him free,'' said John
Wideman, who teaches English at the University of Massachusetts.
``What do we want? Justice, in a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaving together the family's two businesses _ literature and
loss _ the writings of John Wideman are as imposing as prison walls
and as enduring as the tombs of his kin and their victims. He has
never lacked for material: In addition to his imprisoned brother,
John Wideman has a son, Jacob, who is serving a life term for
killing a teenager in Arizona; his nephew, Robert's son Omar, was
shot dead at 21.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to free Robert Wideman is built on the claim that
Morena's 1975 death was caused by the negligence of emergency room
physicians, whose mistakes turned Morena's treatable gunshot wound
into a mortal one.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Robert Wideman maintain that if jurors had known the
role of below-standard medical care, they might have levied a
lesser verdict _ perhaps third-degree murder _ with a shorter
prison term. In that case, Robert Wideman might have been free by
now.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Allegheny County Judge James R. McGregor agreed with
that reasoning and ordered a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have appealed the decision, a process that could
take months. It looked briefly as though Wideman might be released
on bond in the interim, but the district attorney successfully
opposed the move. For now, Wideman remains in Pittsburgh's Western
Penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   The order for a new trial came over the impassioned objections
of Morena's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took my son's life. Twenty-three years in prison? Not
enough. He could die in prison as far as I'm concerned,'' said
Morena's 68-year-old mother, Clara. ``They say it was the doctors'
fault? My son would never have needed medical treatment if he had
not been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the bullet ultimately would have led to
Morena's death, but Wideman's argument for a new trial contains a
legal reality sometimes lost on those who are not lawyers: There
are varying degrees of culpability. In most jurisdictions, a person
cannot be held responsible for every damaging act that results from
his crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harmful conduct of the defendant has to be the genuine
cause of the death, not just a contributing element along the
way,'' said Larry Yackle, a law professor at Boston University who
has not been involved in Wideman's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I bump into you in the street and you fall and sprain your
ankle, and you're taken to the hospital in an ambulance and there's
a crash and you're killed, no one would want to blame me for your
death,'' Yackle said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Zappala Jr., the Allegheny County district attorney,
disputed that argument and said the judge's ruling was ``absolutely
wrong on the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shoot somebody in the back, what difference does it
make what kind of treatment they receive?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The case began the night of Nov. 15, 1975, at a used-car lot
owned by the 24-year-old Morena. He was there with two other men.
Wideman, whose past included three armed robberies, also had two
companions, Michael Dukes and Cecil Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say Morena and his cohorts had agreed to buy a load
of stolen Sony televisions from Wideman, Dukes, and Rice. But
instead of making the illicit sale, Wideman and his friends decided
to rob Morena's group at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping a wad of cash on the ground, Morena took off
running. Wideman, according to testimony at his trial, said
something to the effect of ``Stop him.'' Dukes fired his gun, and
the bullet cut through Morena's back, pierced his right lung, and
exited through his chest. He died two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman and Dukes each were convicted of second-degree murder
and sentenced to life in prison. Rice was convicted of third-degree
murder and robbery; he is free on parole. Dukes remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   With help from his brother John, Robert Wideman spent years
appealing his conviction and seeking a commutation of his sentence,
to no avail. An alleged conspiracy to escape didn't help. Neither
did a 1992 guilty plea to a charge of drug possession while in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But then fortune smiled down on them from a most unlikely
source: the Morena family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Robert Wideman learned that Morena's relatives had
filed a wrongful death lawsuit and in the process had developed the
evidence that would help him win a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the Morenas say that doctors at the hospital
where Nickie Morena was treated neglected to take the most
elementary steps that would have saved his life. They failed to
insert a tube to relieve pressure building in his chest; they
failed to replace the blood he lost; and they failed to use an
oxygen mask.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors settled the suit for $100,000 without admitting
blame. That happened in 1983, but the Widemans did not learn of it
for another 12 years, at which point they immediately began using
the Morenas' findings to win Robert Wideman's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisngly, the Morenas are deeply unhappy about that, but
Wideman's lawyer defended the move. ``All we did was use their
theory and their witness. It takes real gall to suggest that what's
good for them isn't good for my client,'' said Philadelphia
attorney Mark D. Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in October on the new trial motion, Allegheny
County coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht testified that ``the gunshot wound
in and of itself was not the cause of the fatality and that it was
the negligent acts and omissions of other people subsequent to the
shooting'' that caused Morena's death.
</P>
<P>
   Judge McGregor agreed, saying in his order that ``timely and
proper medical care would have spared (Morena's) life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wideman testified at the hearing that his only desire, if
freed from prison, is to be with his family. ``I'm 47 years old. I
mean, there is nothing out there that I need besides the people
that I love. . . . There is nothing more important than family.''
He declined repeated requests for a prison interview.
</P>
<P>
   John Wideman said after the hearing that the family remains
convinced Robert Wideman will someday be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is on his side in this case. So there is room for
hope, but it's always hope tempered with a kind of realism,'' John
Wideman said. ``At the same time, after so many disappointments and
such a long time of incarceration, and so many failures, you get
burned. One gets discouraged at times.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible the new trial ruling will be overturned, and it
is equally uncertain what would happen if it remains in effect. The
district attorney's office has said it no longer has police files,
photos of the crime scene, and other evidence in the case, making
it difficult to mount a new prosecution. Zappala, however, say his
office has no intention of dropping the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Morenas, meanwhile, have vowed to fight Wideman's release.
``I'll travel anywhere, do whatever I have to, to keep him there,''
Clara Morena said. ``When he took our son's life, he took all our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, all the Widemans and the Morenas can do is wait
for a final ruling and hope for different outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these families have been torn apart,'' said
Christopher Conrad, a candidate for district attorney and a former
prosecutor who has followed the case on behalf of the Morena
family. ``It's one of those cases where the people and the issues
just haven't cooled, and there doesn't seem to be any end in
sight.''

MOVIE BRINGS TOXIC TRAGEDY   BACK TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOBURN, Mass. _ Employees jokingly called the ditch behind the
W. R. Grace plant the ``swimming pool,'' though only a fool would
swim there. Until the early 1970s, workers dumped cleaning
solvents, paint, and other wastes into or near the ditch, never
imagining that the poisons might reach public water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   That carelessness cast W. R. Grace &AMP; Co. as a villain in one of
the most famous environmental trials in US history, pitting its
high-priced attorneys against parents who believed that their
children had been killed by Grace chemicals in their tap water. To
this day, the company denies that it poisoned Woburn wells, but it
paid the parents and their lawyers $8 million to end the legal
ordeal in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like a recurring nightmare, a new movie, ``A Civil
Action,'' reintroduces America to a history that Grace officials
have been trying to live down. The film, starring John Travolta as
the driven lawyer representing the Woburn parents, opened in New
York City on Christmas, accompanied by the advance publicity and
critical praise that may foreshadow a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie omits Grace's much-improved environmental
record since 1986, ``A Civil Action'' offers a powerful lens
through which to view how the environmental movement has
transformed American industry since the 1980s. Grace pollutes far
less than it once did, but, like many companies, it is still
haunted by the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think that they are very guilty and responsible for
everything that happened, even though Grace is trying to say they
didn't do it,'' said Woburn plaintiff Donna Robbins, whose
9-year-old son, Carl Robbins III, died of leukemia in 1981. ``I
don't know how they can go around saying they weren't
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Woburn case was never clear-cut, which is why only
a risk-taking lawyer like Travolta's character, Jan Schlichtmann,
would handle the parents' costly lawsuit, driving his law firm into
bankruptcy in the process. Grace's stainless-steel equipment plant
was just one of many industries huddled around wells G and H, the
farthest away of five companies that the US Environmental
Protection Agency later held legally responsible for cleaning up
the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Schlichtmann does not believe that Grace's chemical dumping
was remarkable for industry in the years before states and the
federal government passed tough laws on hazardous waste disposal.
In fact, some of the discharges may have been legal at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more the rule than the exception, in the sense that
they had a lot of things in their past that were ugly. There were
many companies that suffer from the same kind of an ugly past,''
Schlichtmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike other companies near wells G and H, Grace, along
with Beatrice Foods, had ``deep pockets,'' making it a good target
for a lawsuit aimed at recovering large amounts of money. Adding to
Grace's troubles, a conscience-stricken employee revealed the
company's secret dumping practices during preparation for the
trial, indirectly leading to a $10,000 criminal fine against Grace
by the Environmental Protection Agency. In the end, the jury let
Beatrice off, but found that Grace had contributed to the
contamination of the two wells.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Woburn case cemented Grace's image as one of
the nation's top polluters, along with Monsanto of Times Beach,
Mo., and Hooker Chemical of Love Canal in New York. In
Massachusetts alone, Grace was called to account for several other
environmental messes, from toxic chemical lagoons in Cambridge to
the plants in Acton that contaminated 40 percent of the town's
water supply. Meanwhile, thousands of people nationwide were
joining lawsuits charging that asbestos-containing insulation made
by Grace had made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continually do things that once again reinforce the
notion . . . that at times the chemical industry is callous and
acts with disregard for communities,'' Boston University management
professor John Mahon said in describing Grace to the Boston Herald
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   W. R. Grace officials insist they were never as bad as they
seemed to be; for instance, they were the first company around the
wells to test the ground water for contamination. But company
officials admit that they made serious errors in Woburn that turned
the community and government agencies against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes in addressing the concerns of the community
and government agencies, and we realized that it was up to us to
demonstrate our commitment to addressing these concerns,'' said
Mark Stoler, Grace's director of environment, health, and safety
and a junior lawyer for the company at the time of the Woburn
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, W. R. Grace, based in Boca Raton, Fla., barely resembles
the ``mega-corporation'' that Schlichtmann battles in ``A Civil
Action.'' Once a far-flung conglomerate with businesses ranging
from restaurants to pipelines to cruise ships, the empire built by
J. Peter Grace ran into falling profits in the 1980s, prompting
managers to sell off or close three-quarters of the firm's
businesses, leaving a company focused on specialty chemicals such
as cement additives and can sealants.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Grace's employment has plummeted, from 3,000
at the time of the Woburn suit to 538, as the controversial plant
on Washington Street in Woburn closed and the company facilities in
Acton were bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has shrunk in other important ways, as well, reducing its
toxic chemical releases by two-thirds from 1991 to 1995, according
to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, while slashing by
three-quarters both the environmental fines it must pay and its
overall waste generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington,
D.C.-based organization that evaluates corporations for socially
conscious investors, now ranks W. R. Grace as tops among US
specialty chemical companies for following environmental laws. Dan
Kennedy, a reporter for the weekly Boston Phoenix who covered the
trial for the Woburn Daily Times, described Grace as ``one of
Woburn's model corporate citizens'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to ``model corporate citizen'' has been neither
smooth nor easy, reflecting a company caught in a riptide of
changing standards. Grace had never faced an environmental lawsuit
before the Woburn case, despite decades of polluting activities,
such as chemical disposal, mining, radioactive contamination, and
asbestos manufacturing. Until 1987, Grace didn't even have a chief
environmental official.
</P>
<P>
   When the company finally created an Office of Environmental
Policy, they brought in a man to run it who was contemptuous of the
EPA. ``If the FAA were like the EPA, all the planes would crash,''
Hugh L. Carey, hired as Grace's environment director in 1987, told
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Grace has been named a responsible party at 32 Superfund
hazardous waste cleanups across the country, from Woburn to
Lansing, Mich., where the company is part of a cleanup of an old
manufacturing waste pit.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost twice the specialty chemical industry average,
according to the IRRC, and Grace has spent $126 million to clean up
old environmental hazards since 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Grace has paid half a billion dollars to settle
lawsuits over its asbestos-containing insulation, and by the end of
1997 the company faced 96,000 claims of bodily injury from the
insulation, which Grace stopped selling in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Stoler argues that the high number of waste sites partly
reflects the buying and selling of subsidiaries during Grace's
conglomerate years, which made the company owner of waste sites
that it never contaminated. For example, Grace has spent more than
$1 million investigating possible jet-fuel leaks at the
Massachusetts Military Reservation from a pipeline the company
briefly owned after it had already been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Grace's record also reflects decades of sloppy
waste-handling practices, some of which are just coming to light
today. For example, Grace is only now conducting a full search for
asbestos at its Cambridge property and an abutting playing field,
up to 80 years after the contamination began. In New Jersey,
meanwhile, Grace has agreed to resume cleanup of radioactive waste
at a site the company had believed was cleaned up more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And other messes are the subject of dispute. John Morgan of
Winchester has sued Grace, as well as three trucking companies, for
what he says is toxic waste dumping in front of his Rock Avenue
house in 1982, a charge the company vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, activists and government officials who have worked with
Grace at waste sites over the years say they have detected a
profound shift in company attitudes, from defensive and difficult
in the 1980s to helpful and even forward-looking today.
</P>
<P>
   In Acton, where nine Grace waste lagoons and two landfills had
contaminated public wells and the company dragged its feet on the
cleanup for years, the company finally apologized for its conduct
in 1989 and took a more aggressive approach to cleanup in the early
1990s. Activists say the change reflected the intervention of top
Grace environmental officials, eager to speed the cleanup process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished more in three years than we had in the
previous 12,'' said Edmond Benoit, who supervised the Acton cleanup
for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   In Woburn, Grace went from mounting a $7 million legal defense
against the Woburn parents' lawsuit to installing a water treatment
system that was more effective and more costly than the EPA
required.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers say the changes reflect the fact the
sprawling corporation is slowly getting the message that
environmental protection is important, particularly when the highly
regarded Stoler took charge of the firm's environmental affairs in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, as long as Grace is cleaning up its past, some people still
feel at risk. Russ Bromfield of Cambridge, who lives near the area
Grace is studying for asbestos contamination, has been unimpressed
with company efforts to show sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view them more as the enemy,'' Bromfield said. ``They
haven't done anything to show me they have positive intentions in
the neighborhood.''

ROOM FOR SIX MORE IN A CROWDED HALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ballot has to be mailed by midnight Thursday. It has been
staring at me for several weeks. Now it's time.
</P>
<P>
   Casting a vote for Baseball's Hall of Fame is about the coolest
thing we get to do here in the newspaper's Toy Department. The
privilege goes to those who have been card-carrying members of the
Baseball Writers Association of America for at least 10 consecutive
seasons. Voting on Cooperstown credentials is not something I take
lightly. Sadly, I do a lot more research on this ballot than on the
one that confronts me on the first Tuesday of most Novembers.
</P>
<P>
   This year we have a lofty list of new candidates. There are
several worthy leftovers from previous seasons, but the new
eligibles ensure that there's going to be quite a crowd on the
platform in Cooperstown next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The top tier of new nominees (players who've been retired for
exactly five seasons) includes George Brett, Nolan Ryan, Robin
Yount, Carlton Fisk, and Dale Murphy. Other new names on the ballot
are Mike Boddicker, John Candelaria, Charlie Leibrandt, Frank
Tanana, and Mike Witt, but none of them are worthy of serious Hall
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   It's stunning to find five new names with such impressive
resumes. This ballot is to Hall voters what the 1983 NFL drart
(John Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien, Todd
Blackledge) was to quarterback connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   --Brett is an automatic. Top shelf, no dust. You could tell he
was a Hall of Famer just by watching him take batting practice. In
Boston we remember him in his early days as the kid brother of a
lefty who pitched for the '67 Red Sox (Kemer Brett). George was the
goods from Day One. His flirtation with .400 in 1980 (he finished
at .390) stands as his signature season, but 3,154 hits, a lifetime
average of .305, an MVP, and his sheer competitiveness make him a
Hall of Famer. He is the only player in big league history with
3,000 hits, 300 homers, 600 doubles, 100 triples, and 200 stolen
bases.
</P>
<P>
   --Ryan. Not as easy as it looks. His lifetime winning percentage
(.523) is cheesy, and his only championship came when he was an
erratic kid with the 1969 Mets. Early in his career, Ryan was
something of a freak show, always capable of a no-hitter but an
inconsistent winner. He shed the Dominique Wilkins image in his
golden years and sails into the Hall on the strength of 5,714
strikeouts, 324 wins, and seven no-hitters (the last one coming
when he was 44). We may never see another 45-year-old power
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   --Yount. He gets this vote thanks to 3,142 hits, two MVP awards,
and his mastery of two of the sport's toughest positions (shortstop
and center field), but he was never feared like Tony Oliva, Orlando
Cepeda, or Jim Rice _ none of whom are in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   --Fisk. This is torture. New Hampshire's fortunate son caught
more games and hit more homers than any catcher in history. The
problem is, Fisk's numbers are only marginally better than Gary
Carter's and it seems no one wants Carter in Cooperstown. Carter
won three Gold Gloves to Fisk's one, and won a World Series, which
Fisk did not. Here, we can only fall back on the time-tested remark
by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart regarding pornography: ``I
know it when I see it.'' So it goes with Fisk. He always looked
like a Hall of Famer and his 1975 homer helped rescue baseball from
oblivion. Catcher Carlton gets the vote, and here's hoping he opts
for a Red Sox cap on his plaque.
</P>
<P>
   --Murphy. No. See Carter explanation above. He's a two-time MVP
who hit 398 homers. He's unfairly penalized for playing on bad
teams, but his lifetime average of .265 is too low for a Hall of
Fame outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Players must get at least 5 percent of the overall vote to stay
on the ballot, and they stay on for 15 years before their names are
turned over to the Veterans Committee. A candidate must be named on
75 percent of the ballots cast to be inducted into the Hall. Of the
holdover candidates from last year's ballot, the best are Rice and
Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   I vote for Rice, but it's not easy. A ballplayer's cooperation
with the media should have no bearing on one's ballot, and I often
think I vote for Rice just to make sure I'm not accused of letting
his surliness color my vote. His candidacy is marginal, but he
should be getting more votes than he's been getting. Rice hit .298
with 382 homers in 16 seasons, but those of us who saw him every
day know that he was a dominant slugger of his time. This cannot be
said of Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   This is Tiant's 12th year on the ballot and he's not going to
make it, even though he derserves it. Put his numbers up against
Catfish Hunter and Don Drysdale and you see that Luis deserves to
join them in Cooperstown. Tiant was also a better big-game pitcher
than Jim Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. My ballot is mailed with votes for six players (10 is
the maximum allowed). And there is no vote for wonderful players
like Murphy, Carter, Bert Blyleven, Tony Perez, Steve Garvey, Dave
Parker, Bruce Sutter, Dwight Evans, Keith Hernandez, Tommy John,
Jim Kaat, Mickey Lolich, Minnie Minoso, and Tanana. Let the
arguments begin.

ROGUE PORN KING FLYNT PLAYS DIRTY IN DC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Ever since his $1 million bounty on
philandering pols unearthed career-ending dirt on House
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, Larry Flynt has been at ground
zero of Washington's toxic sex scandal. Every columnist with 80
lines to fill invokes his name. The New York Times editorializes
against his ``sleaze empire.'' Ollie North depicts Democrats as the
party of Larry Flynt. Author Gay Talese calls him ``a great truth
seeker.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Flynt Publications empire _ in a black foreboding
building guarded by a statue of John Wayne on horseback _ the phone
lines are buzzing. There are more tips about more politicians who
allegedly sweated up the sheets at the no-tell motel.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the hallway on the 10th floor, the 56-year-old Flynt
presides over this chaos in his garishly appointed office. (The
decor is Fellini-meets-Caesar's Palace. Flynt spent about $2
million to decorate his executive offices with all manner of
statuary and baubles.) Chain-smoking cigars, bedecked in shiny
jewelry, and surrounded by copies of his gynecologically graphic
Hustler magazine, Flynt looks more like a Mafia don than a media
dean. Requiring a wheelchair since he was shot 20 years ago during
a Georgia obscenity trial, his voice is slowed and slurred, and an
occasional twinge ripples through his body.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is no stranger to the limelight, having been lionized in
Milos Forman's acclaimed 1996 film ``The People Vs. Larry Flynt.''
But he is savoring center stage in Monicagate. Forget about perjury
or obstruction of justice, he growls. This scandal ``still gets
back to the basic issue of sex.'' And if sex is the battlefield,
the pornographer is armed. In addition to Livingston, Flynt says
his investigators have come up with the goods on about a dozen sex
sinners in Washington, all but one of them Republican. And he's
getting ready to dish the dirt on what he sees as Bill Clinton's
hypocritical tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   What a perversely fitting close to a year in which the
foundations of government are threatened by the exchange of bodily
fluids, when semen stains and cigar sex antics make headlines, and
when the independent counsel's report reads like the Penthouse
letters page. Amid the slime of our civic life, the most feared
journalist in America is not Bob Woodward, not Michael Isikoff, not
even Matt Drudge. It is a jailbird porn king one month away from
the start of another obscenity trial for peddling prurience in his
Cincinnati Hustler store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of ironies about the whole political
situation, not the least of which is that Larry Flynt is the man
right now that everyone is looking to for news of their political
leaders,'' says his longtime friend and attorney, Alan Isaacman.
``It's absolutely amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Flynt seems to harbor few delusions of grandeur.
People call him ``just a `smut peddler,' '' he says, a smile
playing at his lips. ``But I demand that they call me `Mister smut
peddler' because I've earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smut is my vocation,'' he brags. ``Politics is my hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My reason for getting involved was that I saw the polls
showing a majority of the people were against impeachment,'' says
Flynt. ``There was a lot of apathy. I ran that ad in The Washington
Post because I wanted to expose the hypocrisy that existed in
Washington.'' (It's not that he's squeamish about the Lewinsky
episode. In a recent issue, Hustler published a raunchy photo
spread showing how presidential DNA could have ended up on the blue
dress.)
</P>
<P>
   So on Oct. 4, at a cost of $85,000 for a full-page Post ad,
Flynt offered up to $1 million ``if you can provide documentary
evidence of illicit sexual relations with a Congressman, Senator or
member of the executive or judiciary branches.'' The more than
2,000 responses were ultimately whittled down to about a dozen by
Flynt's investigative reporters and a mysterious firm that he says
is staffed by former FBI and CIA operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was the first to fall, but Flynt says the
``investigations are all ongoing and I'd say a dozen (cases) look
very good.'' They include, by his count, one Democrat , one
high-ranking Republican government official, one Republican
senator. The balance are GOP House members.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Livingston sort of upstaged us,'' by resigning before
Hustler could publish, Flynt is rethinking his ``outing'' strategy.
Because the magazine's lead time is several months, his options
include posting the names on his Internet site, publishing a
special issue, and maybe even calling a press conference to
identify some of the offenders. ``I think it's important to get out
what we've got prior to the Senate making its decision,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Flynt has posted this kind of bounty.
In the 1970s when Democratic Congressman Wayne Hayes was fooling
around with his staffer, Elizabeth Ray, and Democratic House Ways
and Means chairman Wilbur Mills was engaged in escapades with
stripper Fanne Foxe, he offered $25,000 for evidence of similar
follies _ with minimal results.
</P>
<P>
   He even tried his hand at elective politics. Running as a
Republican because ``I was wealthy, white, pornographic, and I've
been shot because of what I believed in,'' he launched a whimsical
1984 presidential bid based on a platform of eliminating venereal
disease and sexual ignorance. It ended when he went to prison for
failing to reveal the source of a tape he'd acquired that became a
central element of the John DeLorean drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt makes no secret of his political loyalties. ``I love
Clinton,'' he says. ``I voted for him in '92. I voted for him in
'96. Sure the guy had an affair and he lied about it. . . . But how
much punishment should he receive?'' Of Lewinsky, he says
dismissively, ``she's a snitch,'' not bothering to ponder the irony
of the snitches who've responded to his reward.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt's opinion of independent counsel Kenneth Starr was summed
up in a letter he wrote to Starr after the release of the Starr
report. ``You have broken historic ground in disseminating
pornographic materials to a broader and more diverse community of
Americans,'' he wrote. ``Given your exemplary work, I would like to
enter into negotiations with you regarding full-time employment for
Hustler magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Burress, president of the Cincinnati-based Citizens for
Community Values, which is battling Flynt over his Hustler store,
thinks the pornographer is harming himself with his current
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that filth and dirt (and) adultery have not
been accepted by this nation yet,'' says Burress. ``Larry Flynt is
doing more to hurt his cause than help his cause.''

BYE-BYE BUGBEARS, YOU'RE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that stock-taking, resolution-making time of year again, a
good moment for the grammatically inclined to catch up on some
long-running usage disputes. Every reader, of course, has a
collection of language bugbears (much nicer animals than those
yappy pet peeves, but still, they can drain your mental energy);
these few, plucked from the year's mail, have been among the most
contentious. Here's how things stand as the new year approaches.
</P>
<P>
   --Healthy skepticism. Eat a healthful diet and you'll be
healthy, we were taught, and several readers _ most recently
Dorothy Osborn of Wenham and Andy Malkasian of Billerica _ have
complained about the increasing use of healthy for healthful. But
as my favorite usage gurus note (and the Oxford English Dictionary
citations show), healthy has also meant ``conducive to health'' for
more than 400 years; the distinction wasn't invented till 1811,
says Merriam-Webster's usage guide. If you observe it, ``you are
absolutely correct, and in the minority. If you ignore the
distinction you are absolutely correct, and in the majority.'' So
cross that problem off your list, and here's to your health!
</P>
<P>
   --Hopefully, resignedly. The use of hopefully as a ``sentence
adverb'' _ ``Hopefully, the hurricane will go out to sea'' _ has
inflamed opposition since it spread in the '60s, but it continues
to make headway, despite the feelings of correspondents like Edward
Carbonaro of Franconia, N.H. Similar sentence adverbs
(``Mercifully, he felt no pain'') are not strictly analogous to
hopefully, the critics object, but subtle matters of parsing can't
stop a crowd determined to have its way with a word. And even those
of us brought up to shun hopefully can admit its usefulness;
William Safire, the New York Times word man, defended it nearly two
decades ago. The new Oxford University Press usage guide calls
hopefully a ``skunked'' word _ one tainted by controversy _ but its
bad odor is fading fast, especially among the young. Regrettably or
not, hopefully will be with us for a while.
</P>
<P>
   --Growing pains. Some readers are alarmed by the spread of the
transitive grow beyond its agricultural domain. Growing corn and
tomatoes is all very well, say Alan Rechel of Belmont and Tom
Halsted of Manchester, but when did growing a business and growing
the economy become part of the language? I shared their pain when I
first saw grow used this way (in Inc. magazine, 20 years ago), but
I haven't found any good arguments against it, aside from the taint
of jargon _ and that will fade with time and use. After all, if you
can grow a beard or a crystal, why not a business? In fact, this
sense existed long ago, according to the OED, which gives an
example (here modernized) from 1481: ``When David had reigned seven
years in Hebron, he grew and amended much this city.'' So let's
look on the bright side: We're not gaining a neologism, we're
reclaiming a bit of our linguistic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   --Begging to differ. Readers who know what beg the question
really means _ to argue in a way that assumes the very thing in
dispute _ are an articulate but tiny minority. Most people now use
it to mean ``pose the question,'' and since the language of formal
logic is not widely used, there's nothing to slow the
transformation. But if you'd rather not annoy those few informed
readers or listeners, be careful with beg the question. You're
about as likely to win the lottery as to find yourself using it
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   --Pronounced dead. Two classic pronunciation battles seem all
but decided, and as usual, the majority rules. Short-lived _ which
Jim Daley of Colchester, Vt., Dana Whittemore of Wakefield, and I
pronounce to rhyme with strived _ is more and more often rhymed
with sieved. The argument for the long-i short-lived is that the
word is formed from the noun life, not the verb live, but our
fellow citizens seem immune to our reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   --Then there's forte, one's specialty or strength; the purist
side has argued for making it one syllable, like the French word
it's based on, not two syllables like the Italian adverb forte.
Problem is, the French word is not forte but fort, with a silent t.
And if we've already changed the spelling and pronunciation, why
stick at syllabification? I'll stick with FORT, one syllable, if
forced to say the word, but Merriam-Webster's countenances all
options: ``Since there is no etymologically respectable
pronunciation available for this word, we might as well select one
that feels natural.'' And at the moment, for-tay seems to be the
people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   And now, a proposed resolution. For 1999, let's abandon the old,
familiar usage topics _ teach your bugbears to sit! and stay! _ and
come up with a fresh list of issues. To the handful above, after
decades of disputation, it's time to say hail and farewell.

   BOSTON _ I'm going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried to redeem my frequent-flier miles but the islands I'm
interested in are booked until summer. I've carried the baby on the
shuttle and seen the businessman glare at us as though we were
personally siphoning off their 401(k)s. Were they born at age 42
with cell phones embedded in their palms?
</P>
<P>
   I have made my bed in Quincy and I'm lying in it looking out the
window, over the tops of houses. There, seven miles away out to sea
is the blinking beacon that is the last manned lighthouse in
America. Boston Light.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Garland had it right when she recited that famous phrase,
``There's no place like home.'' Every morning I open one eye, watch
the sunrise, and go back to sleep. It is a beautiful thing. Boston
Light is an exclamation point in the sea and the last marker before
the Old World. It never shuts off and it never disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Boston Light is serenaded by incoming aircraft
to Logan. The jets are all lined up one minute apart. Passengers
are being told to shut off their electronic devices and return
their seats to the upright, knees-into-the-guy-in-front-of-you
position. When the plane lands, everyone will jump up, elbows out,
and maneuver into the aisle in a scene reminiscent of the
long-forgotten National Basketball Association. And then they will
wait until they are older than John Glenn. Then some poor soul's
luggage will wind up in Bosnia and not Boston and the cab driver
will have his seat set way back and his two-way radio set on Voice
of Pakistan. It won't be me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the great thing about Boston Light. You can't get
there. There's no public docking, and except for four trips by the
Friends of Boston Harbor in the warm months, the general public is
shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard wants to make this place more accesible,''
said Scott Stanton, 67th keeper of the light. The public is invited
during daylight hours. ``Kayakers come all the time,'' said
Stanton. The 76-step lighthouse with stunning views of Boston is
open, but the residence is closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is that in 1716 they were doing the same
thing we are doing now,'' said Stanton. Unfortunately, the first
two lightkeepers drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: For all the hype about Boston Harbor and the
islands, things have been disappointing. Let's start with the
Federal courthouse. Criminals and lawyers are the last three groups
that deserve a room with a view. Why can't we appreciate a good
thing? Harborlights was a great place to go to a waterfront
concert; it was the Hub's answer to the Sydney Opera House. So they
forced it to move.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacle Island was supposed to be a landscaped park years ago,
but grass grows there as well as hair grows on Opie's head. Then
you have Moon Island, the gateway to Long Island and the first
island in the Boston Harbor Island chain accessible by car. What's
there? A police firing range, where every day sounds like Chinese
New Year. Take your best shot.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Things, of course, could be worse. My esteemed colleague and
friend Charles Sennott recently journeyed to Baghdad to cover
Desert Fox. He brought his own sterilized needle because the Iraqis
were drawing blood at the border. I'm not going there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor am I going to those fancy resorts in Bermuda. I went there
at this time one year to relax and learn how to play golf. After
swinging as if I was trying to hit home runs for two hours, I
started having back spasms and started turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   As I doubled over in pain, my wife called for a doctor. But
instead, a man with a walkie talkie came running into the room. I
couldn't straighten up to see his face but I could read his tag.
``Loss prevention,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Light is majestic. Commissioned by Washington and
destined to be manned forever, thanks to Senator Edward Kennedy, it
brings light in the darkness and is reportedly haunted by spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to turn on the light and I saw someone up in the
tower,'' said Stanton, who along with an assistant lives on the
island. ``So I went back into the house and there was my partner
sitting on the couch. I said, `Weren't you up in the tower?' and he
said `No.' Now I'm not saying it was a ghost, but there was nobody
else on that island.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Light is also, for our young readers, the all-time
greatest backdrop to go ``parking.''
</P>
<P>
   (Go to Hull and travel east until you get to the cemetery and
then drive up to the upper level just below Fort Revere. From
there, you can see a sweeping view of the coastline. Boston Light
and Graves Light line up perfectly amid splashing whites and dark
sea blues. But don't look for me there. I'm going nowhere.)

A `HOMECOMING' TO CONNEMARA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARRAROE, Ireland _ Everyone should know where they come from,
and I come from Connemara.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a physical sense. I was born in Boston, a half-century
after my grandparents gave up the harsh life of Connemara in the
west of Ireland for a chance in America. But when I am in
Connemara, it does not feel foreign. It feels like home, in a
strange, ineffable, almost disturbing way.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1979, as a 20-year-old, I first went to the rocky, wild
region known as Connemara, it was intimidating. I hitchhiked out
from Dublin, where I was a student. The Irish midlands are flat,
like the middle of America, providing little to look at and less to
admire. But that all changes once you get to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Connaught is the western province of Ireland. When Oliver
Cromwell banished rebellious Irish peasants in the 17th century the
cry was, ``To hell or Connaught!'' Some could hardly tell the
difference. The ground was too rocky to grow anything. The wind
whipped across the bogs unhindered. I felt that chill, walking
through the bogs, staring at the shells of drafty, stone houses,
the kind my grandparents left behind.
</P>
<P>
   I walked down a lonely road, heading vaguely toward a crossroads
called Maam Cross. The sun was going down and there wasn't a person
or a car in sight. Suddenly I became aware of the ground hissing,
noises rising from the peat bogs and then . . . poof! The ground
was popping, and flames danced briefly on the surface. There was a
rational explanation, of course. It was simply gas being released
from the peat. But, at dusk, in a place devoid of any sign of life,
it was disarming, almost chilling.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like the smugness of a spoiled American, but when
I first saw where my grandparents left, my strongest emotion was
gratitude that they had. What opportunities did people growing up
in such disadvantage have? Older relatives told me that both of my
mother's parents came from large families and that not one but
several of their siblings had died in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is an endearing defiance to Connemara. Its land is
not arable, and yet the people survived. The British did everything
they could to stamp out the Irish language, viewing it the slang of
seditionists, and yet it survived, no place more strongly than in
Connemara, the heart of the Gaeltacht, where Irish is the first
language, as it was my grandparents'.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through Connemara, it was hard not to be overcome by the
terrible beauty, something as simple as watching a Galway family
turning and stacking peat in the summer, when it stays light until
almost 11 p.m., something as dramatic as the rocky coast at
Roundstone, where you can watch the surf pound from O'Dowd's pub
and chat up the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, in a pub in the little crossroads that amounts
to the center of Carraroe, I was introduced to two old men who knew
my grandfather. One of them was in his 90s, the other his late 80s.
They were crestfallen when, after they greeted me in Irish, I said
I didn't have any of the language. We had a pint together, but it
wasn't the same once they realized I was, by blood, from this place
but not of it.
</P>
<P>
   I was slightly ashamed, leaving the pub, that I never learned
anything but a few words in Irish. When I was a child, my big,
stern grandmother sometimes looked after me on the second-floor of
a triple-decker in South Boston that was my family's American
homestead. I remember her speaking to me in Irish, sometimes
fondly, sometimes harshly, to correct me when she caught me jumping
on her high poster bed. I remember she sang lullabies to me in
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, who as a first-generation immigrant was so determined
to assimilate that she had no interest in Irish, says her parents
constantly clashed over the language. My grandmother would
regularly speak Irish, but my grandfather, who came from an
Irish-speaking village called Camus, couldn't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether my grandmother spoke Irish out of
some fierce determination to keep the language alive or merely to
have a means of communication with her husband that their children
wouldn't understand. Either way, my grandfather would have none of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delia,'' he would say, using the Irish pet form of Brigid, as
he sat in his arm chair reading the newspaper, ``you're in America
now. Speak American.''
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather died 19 years before I was born. My grandmother
died when I was 4, and I have only vague recollections of her. But,
in ways I could never explain, I felt them both when I first went
to Connemara, and I still feel them whenever I return.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I brought my mother to Carraroe for the first time.
She is old and feeble now, but she seemed to have a burst of energy
when she set foot in the village where her mother grew up. We went
into the pub where I met the old men who knew her father, but they
had long since died.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's short-term memory is failing, and she sometimes
forgets where she is. We were sitting there, my sister, my mother,
and I, for some time when the surrounding conversations in Irish
triggered something. My mother beckoned me closer by flexing her
index finger up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' she whispered conspiratorily. ``Everyone in here's
Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland has changed dramatically in the last 20 years,
especially the last 10. The west of Ireland has changed the least,
but even it is so different. The unspoiled countryside has too many
houses for my taste, especially when you consider that most of them
are vacation homes and are hardly ever used.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my friends suggest that, when I can afford it, I should
buy a house in Connemara. I don't know. It's not as simple as that.
They say you can't go home, but these days, if you have enough
money, you can.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you can go home, however, does not mean you should.
Connemara doesn't need any more wistful Americans, and it certainly
doesn't need any more houses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I have taken my sons there, and when they're old enough
to understand, I'll explain to them where their great-grandparents
came from, why they left, why we go back, and why it's important to
know where you come from, but not so important that you have to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   (Connemara is best reached by flying into Shannon Airport and
driving north into Galway. Aer Lingus flies daily to Shannon from
Logan Airport in Boston. Call 800-223-7660 for information and
reservations.)

IN MACAO: ECHOES OF ANOTHER TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By H.D.S. GREENWAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 30 years have passed since I first set forth from the
seething seafront of Hong Kong for the 40-mile run across the Pearl
River estuary to the Portuguese colony of Macao, a small peninsula
and two islands hanging off of China like an earring into the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now one went to Macao either for a rest from the din of
Macao's big brother, Hong Kong, or to gamble in the casinos that
are not allowed in the British colony. Possessing the most
beautiful waterfront on the China coast, Macao had a slower, more
languid pace, and the beauty of its crumbling Portuguese
architecture spoke of a different time and place. Macao's two
subsidiary islands, Taipa and Coloane, then as now, were mostly
rural where the ancient ways of China continued free from the
disruptions of the Cultural Revolution that swept across China and
occasionally lapped into the city of Macao itself.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, China was forbidden to Americans, and dangerous
for foreigners, and so Macao was an easy alternative where you
could sit in comfort and safety and look across at China just
across the inner harbor where so much turmoil was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Macao has done much to destroy its tranquillity. Much of the
sweeping waterfont has been filled in to make way for shoe-box
office buildings, but there is still a trace left of the old and
graceful Lusitanian city that is home to half a million Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller and older than Chelsea, Macao was founded by the
Portuguese as a trading post in 1557. Other foreigners followed,
and the cemeteries are sprinkled with Yankee sailors and merchants
who risked disease, civil insurrections, and typhoons in order to
trade with the Middle Kingdom, as China was then called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this lieth the body of Mr. Samuel Procter of Boston. A
young gentleman much esteemed . . . who departed this life at Macao
in January the 12th, 1792, aged 21 years,'' reads one tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1844, Caleb Cushing, the American consul in Macao, signed
America's first commercial treaty with China in the courtyard of a
13th-century temple.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the 19th century, however, Macao declined
in importance as Hong Kong, newly acquired by Britain, grew. Macao
became the backwater it still is; raffish, more than a little
seedy, with all sorts of smuggling and criminal gang wars waged
under the noses of the Portuguese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on a hillside looking back toward Hong Kong sits the
Bella Vista, a great colonial mansion that has served as a hotel
off and on for a hundred years. In the '60s, it was a lime-green
near-ruin that was nonetheless beloved by those who were young or
undemanding enough to put up with its inconveniences in exchange
for ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bella Vista has been transformed by the Oriental
Hotel group into one of the most beautiful hotels in the world.
With only eight rooms, it has the look and feel of a great house to
which one has been invited for the weekend. Its rooms are simple,
beautifully furnished, with bathrooms bigger than most modern hotel
rooms. There is a quiet bar, and there is dining on the terrace in
the limpid air of the semi-tropics.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms on the southeast corner are the best, looking down the
tree-lined Pria Grande that winds by the water, over-looked by the
pink palace that is the residence of the Portuguese governor.
Sitting on a private balcony, sipping a glass of port with the
night coming softly in from the sea, it is possible to feel for a
moment the lost romance of the China coast, and hear the last faint
echoes of the oldest and last colonial empire east of Suez.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. Less than a year from now, on Dec. 19, 1999,
Macao, like Hong Kong before it, will revert to Chinese
sovereignty. And before that, in the springtime, the Bella Vista
will close its doors forever and become the residence of the first
Portutuguese consul general. Lucky man.
</P>

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Other than $25,000 in expenses and a series
of setbacks in court, George Robertson has little to show for his
long, lonely struggle against two giants, his former employer, Bell
Helicopter, and the US government.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson is persistent. Last month, acting as his own
lawyer, the self-styled whistle-blower filed a new lawsuit in an
attempt to claim part of the money he says the government recovered
as a result of his tip that Bell padded its bills on defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman handling the case for Bell, a division of
Providence-based Textron Inc., did not return a telephone call
requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's one-man campaign against Bell, one of the largest
employers in metropolitan Tarrant County, and the Defense
Department bureaucracy is a case study in the world of
whistle-blowers, a term used for renegade employees who report
wrongdoing they perceive in their workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 55, has instituted several unsuccessful actions since
he was fired by Bell nearly seven years ago. ``Sometimes my wife
calls me obsessed,'' he said. ``But I keep doing it because I don't
have any choice, because I don't have any job.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been unable to find another position because Bell
blacklisted him in the defense industry. He has been sustained over
the years, he said, by a family inheritance and a savings account
he built up through an overseas job with another defense
contractor. His wife has taken a part-time job, and Robertson said
he has been reduced to working at a car wash several days a week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he won an $85,000 judgment against Bell only to have
the jury verdict overturned by a federal judge three months later.
He was chastised by another federal judge for filing ``frivolous''
litigation and had subsequent suits thrown out of court. Both Bell
and the Department of Defense have rebuffed his efforts to obtain
documents relevant to the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robertson pushes on.
</P>
<P>
   He had been employed by Bell for six years as a contractor
administrator involved in a multimillion-dollar program to upgrade
aging Army helicopters when he lost his job on Valentine's Day
1992. Robertson contends he was dismissed because he warned a
civilian Army contracting officer not to agree to Bell's demand for
more than $1 million in cost overruns on the helicopter project. He
said Bell used an unreliable accounting system to falsify charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bell contended, at the time, that Robertson was a victim of
economic cutbacks. In a letter of recommendation, a Bell vice
president called him ``a very dependable employee,'' and added,
``through no fault of his own, George has been caught in the middle
of a downsizing of our entire organization.'' Later, when Robertson
challenged the move, the company said he had been laid off because
his job performance ratings were low.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that in late 1990, he first advised an Army
representative to disregard $1.6 million in bills from Bell because
there was not proper verification for the work in the accounting
system. When a supervisor, Alvin Leavell, instructed Robertson to
write a letter demanding payment from the Army, Robertson said, he
refused.
</P>
<P>
   He said Leavell also became skeptical about the billing and was
soon transferred to another department. ``Leavell told me they
would never fire him because he was black, but he warned me, `Watch
your back,' '' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   After he was fired, Robertson said he had difficulty finding an
attorney to represent him. ``A lot of lawyers said, `We're not
going against Bell because nobody ever wins against them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He finally found an attorney who handled the case on a
contingency-fee basis and sued Bell. After a five-day trial in
April 1993, a jury awarded Robertson $85,000. His base salary had
been $52,500 a year, he said, and fringe benefits pushed it to
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that judicial experts say is uncommon but within the
rule of law, US District Judge Eldon Mahon threw out the verdict,
saying the ``jury's findings were clearly based solely on prejudice
or speculation and not on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson still is indignant and says that Mahon distorted his
position. ``I wanted to appeal, but I couldn't find a lawyer
willing to say the judge lied,'' he said in an interview at his
home in a middle-class Fort Worth subdivision. So Robertson
appealed, himself, without success at several levels.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Robertson filed a separate suit against Bell on
behalf of the United States, accusing the company of overcharging
the government in connection with the helicopter maintenance work.
The case was quickly pitched out by US District Judge John McBryde
of Fort Worth, who rebuked Robertson in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tragic that a company can be put to the expense
Bell has been put to and the taxpayers can be caused to incur as
much as the taxpayers have incurred because of the conduct of Mr.
Robertson in this case,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   (In September, in an unrelated decision, a panel of federal
judges sanctioned McBryde for ``intemperate, abusive, and
intimidating'' court behavior and barred him from receiving new
cases for up to a year.)
</P>
<P>
   Falling back on the Freedom of Information Act, Robertson
obtained several interesting documents from the Defense Department.
One was a letter, dated March 29, 1994, from the Army to Bell
offices in Fort Worth informing the company: ``You are indebted to
the United States government in the amount of $769,006 . . . for
unsubstantiated charges to the Army Helicopter Improvement
Program.''
</P>
<P>
   Another batch of material included minutes from a meeting of
Defense Department officials. The document took note of a Justice
Department determination in the Bell case: ``If any of Robertson's
allegations result in administrative settlement, Robertson is
entitled to . . . share.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he is convinced the Defense Department moved
against Bell because of his reports. He learned, through another
Freedom of Information filing, that the Defense Department
eventually settled with Bell for $125,000. Although his suit on
behalf of the government was dismissed, Robertson believes he is
entitled to a percentage of the money recovered by the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the department rejected him flatly. Moreover,
wrote Ellie G. Bomar, assistant counsel for the Defense Logistic
Agency in Dallas, ``I do not believe any further discussions
between us would be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson refused to take no for an answer. He has now made the
United States a defendant in a federal court complaint in which he
is asking for $31,250.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong,'' he said of his treatment at the hands of Bell
and the bureaucracy. ``The government won't do anything. You can't
get anywhere; it's just unbelievable. But I'm still working on
it.''

   MAPUTALAND, South Africa _ On safari at Phinda Forest Lodge, you
spend up to eight hours a day watching and photographing animals,
the majestic to the mundane, the lion to the dung beetle. It seems
only fair, then, to give them a turn watching you. Which may
explain why many guests in the glass houses at Forest Lodge don't
bother to draw the curtains. There's little chance of another human
catching a glimpse of you bathing, sleeping, dressing, or whatever.
The 17 glass houses are too far apart for that, each perched on
stilts, standing in splendid isolation in one of the world's last
remaining sand forests. So what if a warthog trots by on those
skinny little legs, trying to keep that huge head up, and sees you
standing in the altogether: He's naked, too, and probably even
funnier looking.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the countries I visited in 1998, South Africa was my
favorite. And of all the places I stayed in South Africa, Phinda
ranks number one. ``Phinda'' is Zulu for ``return'' _ reference to
the return to the wild bushveld of a property that was once
overgrazed ranch land. This part of South Africa used to be as
teeming with wildlife as East Africa's Serengeti. But farming here
drove the animals out; only now are they being coaxed to return.
</P>
<P>
   My visit last month was also a return: I'd stayed at Phinda in
1994, after South Africa's democratic elections, when the country
was bracing for an influx of foreign tourists. Phinda's owner,
Conservation Corporation Africa, was established in 1990 to offer
low-density, high-quality _ and high-priced _ safari experiences,
while working on worthy projects like community education and
relocation of animals, so you don't feel as bad about giving them
all that money.
</P>
<P>
   Phinda has four lodges, each with a distinct personality. Forest
and Mountain lodges are the larger ones, while Rock and Vlei lodges
accommodate only 12 guests each, in splendor that includes private
plunge pools and meals served wherever you want them. (Should your
wealthy in-laws offer a family vacation for next Christmas, suggest
they take over all of Rock or Vlei for a festive and unforgettable
reunion.)
</P>
<P>
   Phinda is diverse: seven ecosystems to explore; over 400 species
of birds; cruises on the Mzinene River; scuba diving off
Maputaland's coral reefs; bush walks escorted by an armed ranger;
tracking the endangered black rhino on foot. But the heart of the
Phinda experience is the two daily game drives, at dawn and sunset,
when the animals are out. The 5 a.m. wakeup call is as close to
hardship as Phinda comes. The sympathetic staff members inject you
with strong coffee and ply you with home-made rusks flavored with
honey and cinnamon. Thus fortified, you go out to check the animal
tracks that are the morning newspaper, telling you what's happened
overnight, which animals have gone where. (Actually, it's the
tracker, perched on a folding chair at the front of the Land Rover,
who spots the pawprints on what looks like a blank dirt road to the
untrained eye.) The game drive can take up to four hours, depending
on your luck, and it's off-road: The Land Rover drives right over
scrubby bushes, and the tracker breaks off branches that might
graze against guests' faces.
</P>
<P>
   The animals seek shelter in the heat of midday, and so do you,
napping after a splendid lunch of, say, ostrich and paw-paw or
smoked snoek (it's a fish). The only scary episode of my first
Phinda visit was having an angry ostrich chase my Land Rover; I
didn't mind eating these particularly nasty birds after that.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival at Phinda, you're assigned a ranger who not only runs
the game drives but eats with you, too, unless you choose to eat
alone in your little house. Highly trained, the rangers interpret
the landscape and its inhabitants, some of which you might
otherwise not see. You'd no doubt notice the lions sacked out on
the grass, surrounded by the yellow wild hibiscus and purple
morning glories that flourish in the reddish, iron-rich soil. But
the dung beetle? These cute little critters blend right into the
ground, but once you sight them, they're mesmerizing. They're
engaged in a Sisyphean task, rolling balls of poop like you or I
would shape a meatball _ only imagine a meatball bigger than you
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black'' and ``white'' rhinos are actually both mud-colored, my
ranger said, calling the beasts ``the lawn mowers of the wild''
because their poor digestive systems force them to chomp away at
the grass all day long. Watching animals eat helps boost guests'
appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Phinda's flora are as varied as the fauna. Chinese lantern
flowers _ fuzzy puffs of pink with fuzzy yellow pendants _ look so
unnatural they made me laugh. So did the salami-like pendants
dangling from the ``sausage trees.''
</P>
<P>
   I am, truth to tell, more interested in architecture than
animals, and Phinda's examples of the former are as entertaining as
the latter. The rectilinear glass boxes at Forest Lodge are part
Frank Lloyd Wright, part Philip Johnson, part Japan. There's great
attention to detail: The soap dish is a piece of rugged stone;
instead of a plastic bag to put your laundry in, there is a
handsome wicker basket; soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions
are all in coordinating colors, purple, in the case of my bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Rock, which I also visited, is in the ``Flintstones''
style of architecture so prevalent in recent hotel design from the
American Southwest to the Middle East _ no right angles, just
organic, fluid forms and irregularly shaped windows. It's a
cradling, humanistic style of building. Doorknobs at Rock lodge are
in the form of metal lizards. Candelabra spew soot onto
white-washed walls, creating instant age. Nighttables are thick
tree trunks topped with irregularly cut chunks of bubbly blue-green
glass, on which rest the remote controls for your air conditioning:
You're not here to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finally time for me to leave my Phinda paradise, I
reentered the real world _ Johannesburg _ in stages. I took
Phinda's little private plane from Phinda's private airstrip and
flew to nearby Richard's Bay _ where the airport has a private
Phinda lounge _ one last touch of luxe.
</P>
<P>
   (Prices at Phinda range from $280 per person per day at Phinda
Mountain and Phinda Forest in low season, which starts in April, to
$500 per person per day for Phinda Rock and Phinda Vlei, year
round. Prices include all food, game drives, cruises, even laundry.
Only drinks are extra. To make reservations, call the Conservation
Corporation in South Africa at 011-27-11-784-7077, or fax
011-27-11-784-7667.)

A GRANDER PALACE THAN IN A FAIRY TALE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   UDAIPUR, India _ As a little girl, my favorite make-believe game
was to play a princess living grandly in a fairy-tale castle.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, a stay at the Lake Palace Hotel, a former royal
playground in India's northwestern state of Rajasthan (literally,
Land of the Kings), surpassed any childhood fantasies of luxury and
beauty. A two-night stay stretched to three . . . and then four.
Believe me, if I had unlimited resources and no job, I'd still be
happily ensconced there today.
</P>
<P>
   In two years traveling around Asia, the Lake Palace reigns as
one of the most incredible places I've been. From the moment one
arrives by boat from the mainland, the visitor experiences history
not as a tourist ordered to gaze from behind velvet ropes but as an
honored guest invited to live for a spell as the maharajas once
did. It is a rare place where one can travel back in time and
experience a monument in its original form, rather than as a museum
open from 9 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Palace is a reverie in pure white marble _ a confection
of delicate columns, filagreed screens, cupolas and fountains _
that seems to float like a giant wedding cake in the center of Lake
Pichola. It was built 250 years ago when Maharana Jagat Singh II
wanted a place to frolic with the ladies of his court. His father
frowned on Jagat Singh II's moonlit picnics on his island
playground, admonishing his son, ``Build your own palace.''
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later in 1959 _ two years after India won its
independence from Britain and Maharana Bhagwat Singh joined his
principality to the new state of Rajasthan _ the latter-day ruler
decided to turn the palace into a hotel, trusting it would lure
tourists and money to his former kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Famous vistors have included Queen Elizabeth II, Jacqueline
Kennedy, and Vivien Leigh. As the hotel's fame grew, it was chosen
as an exotic backdrop in the James Bond movie ``Octopussy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century British historian and traveler, Colonel James
Tod, described the palace as ``nothing but marble . . . columns,
baths, reservoirs, fountains, all are of this material, often
inlaid with mosaics, and the uniformity pleasingly diversified by
the light passing through glass of every hue. . . . Parterres of
flowers, orange and lemon groves intervene. . . . Detached,
collonaded refectories are placed on the water's edge for the
chiefs, and extensive baths for their use. Here they listened to
the tale of the bard, and slept off their noonday opiate amidst the
cool breezes of the lake, wafting delicious odours from myriads of
lotus flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   My noontime lethargy was brought on by an Indian buffet lunch
rather than opium, but it was still heavenly to nap it off with the
aid of those same lake breezes and the perfume of lotus flowers
rising from an enclosed pond surrounded by umbrella-topped tables.
There are no palace bards today, but there are nightly performances
of music, dance, and, my favorite, puppet shows of heroes and
horses in rainbow-hued silks reenacting Rajasthani legends.
</P>
<P>
   India is one of the world's most fascinating countries,
overflowing with art and history and a lively, raucous democracy.
But it is also burdened with heartbreaking, visceral poverty.
Separated as it is from the mainland, the Lake Palace is one of the
few places the traveler can, perhaps selfishly, escape the noises
and smells of a teeming nation. The contrast makes it seem all the
more one of the most restful places on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The interiors of the standard rooms are unexciting, but they
give the traveler a chance to experience the hotel at a less
expensive (albeit still steep) price. The small suites have sitting
rooms or balconies, and the deluxe and historical suites are out of
this world. I stayed in the Sandhya (``Evening'') Suite, a medley
of green, blue, and yellow paintings, quilts, and rugs with a
decadent marble bathroom. The best part was a scalloped,
triple-arched, stained-glass window seat right at water level,
where I watched the red ball of the sun plunge into the lake every
night.
</P>
<P>
   Another beauty was the Khush Mahal Suite, with its multicolored,
filigreed stained-glass windows that cast a dazzling pattern on a
black-and-white checkerboard marble floor. With its diffused light
and low, cushioned furniture, the room has an exotic, Arabian
Nights feel. A whimsical wooden and brass swing hangs from the
center of the room.
</P>
<P>
   The Sajjan Niwas, the former personal quarters of the maharana,
is the most elaborate suite, replete with heavily-carved Victorian
furniture and priceless carpets. It has a private courtyard with a
pavilioned terrace and views of the lake and mountains. Best of
all, the walls are inlaid with intricate designs in Belgian glass
and painted with elaborate floral designs.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless lovely palaces and forts to see within a
day's drive of the Lake Palace, but I could hardly be bothered to
leave the hotel. With the intimacy of its secluded porticos and its
discreet service, the hotel must be one of the most romantic places
in the world. A testament to the magic of the place is that I was
there alone _ and I didn't care one bit.
</P>
<P>
   (Indian Airlines flies daily to Udaipur from New Delhi and
Bombay. Standard double rooms cost $210 a night; lake-facing
doubles are $245; suites run from $325 to $550. For more

TRUST ME

 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spectacle of the National Basketball Association on the
verge of canceling a season over its inability to share out $2
billion among 29 owners and 400 players is disgusting. The deadline
is said to be Jan. 7. If negotiations fail, it will be the first
time an entire sports major league season has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   It will be on the owner's heads.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the players are exceedingly well paid. The issues are
complex. The owners are asking for a major overhaul of the system.
</P>
<P>
   But they refuse to open their books.
</P>
<P>
   Sports page reporters have been carrying the story, and well.
They are in close contact with Patrick Ewing, New York Knicks
superstar from Cambridge, who has risen to the presidency of the
players' union; Commissioner David Stern; and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The aspect that lifts the story out of the sports pages is the
league's negoiating stance. The owners want to roll back players'
share of revenues to 53 percent from the current level of roughly
57 percent and adopt rules that would apportion players' shares
quite differently from the present way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in the privacy of negotiations, the NBA has made no
concrete financial case for the massive rebalancing that it seeks.
Trust me, they say. We're hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Only one team in the league _ the Boston Celtics _ is publicly
owned and therefore compelled by law to disclose audited financial
statements. All the rest rely in varying degrees on privacy and
complicated relationships among related enterprises _ owned arenas,
concession business, naming rights and so on _ to mask their total
return on investment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, bargainers for the players (and
reporters who follow the issue) are reduced to making the kinds of
educated guesses with which Kreliminologists track the performance
of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College professor, an expert on
professional athletics who consults to the NBA players'
association, went through such an exercise last month. He noted
that players had received relatively detailed information from the
owners about the 1996-97 season and concluded then that possibly 4
teams in the league suffered negative cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, revenues had soared. Eight teams had signed
deals to build new arenas _ including all four of the 1996-97
loss-making teams. But owners shared only ``cursory and largely
meaningless'' financial data from last year's season. (The NBA
Monday failed to return a telephone call.)
</P>
<P>
   So the owners want to vote themselves a raise at the expense of
the players. And why not? Star players have been wracking up
tremendous contracts. The Chicago Bulls signed Michael Jordan for a
single year at $33 million; David Robinson collected $12.4 million
last year from the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Zimbalist calculated (conservatively, he said) that
the average NBA team showed around a $3 million profit last year,
rising to around $16.5 million by 2002 under the new TV contract.
With 14 coaches earning more than even the highest paid football
coaches in the National Football League _ and a few earning as much
a $8 million _ no wonder the owners are feeling poor.
</P>
<P>
   Or so you might think.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you look at franchise values that the magnitude of
team owners' compensation becomes clear. Expansion fees were $32.5
million in 1988; they were $128 million in 1994, Zimbalist says.
Eighty percent of the New Jersey Nets changed hands last month for
$150 million. Whatever the multiple, at those prices no owner
should be complaining about his take-home pay!
</P>
<P>
   So now one of the greatest marketing successes of the last
quarter century is in danger _ because of its owners' greed.
``Trust me,'' after all, is just another way to say, ``Nuts to
you!''
</P>

TO INDIA WITH LOVE: PEN PALS MEET AFTER 35 YEARS

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENANDS, N.Y _ Thirty-five years ago, Marsha White was flipping
through Look magazine when she spotted the following advertisement:
``Would you like to exchange magazines with a person in another
country?''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? recalled White, who was 14 at the time. Always looking
for new things to try, she once answered an ad seeking people to
peddle Christmas cards. Later, she was even a backup go-go dancer
one night when Otis Redding played a concert in Annapolis, Md.,
near her hometown of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   White was forever adventurous, but she never suspected the short
letter she sent 16-year-old Rajendra Sukhtankar in Poona, India,
would lead to a 35-year correspondence and _ most recently _ an
eight-day trip around the world.
</P>
<P>
   White met her long-distance pen pal for the very first time in
November when, as a 50th birthday present, her husband Charles gave
her a plane ticket. The couple live in the Albany suburb of
Menands.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 35 years, Marsha White and Rajendra
Sukhtankar exchanged many letters. They wrote frequently at first,
focusing mostly on how vastly their cultures differed. ``What are
sweat shirts?'' he wanted to know. ``What is bowling?''
</P>
<P>
   She answered his questions and wrote about parties, dances and
boyfriends. He told her about Hinduism, his studies and his
parents' search for a suitable wife for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family was pretty conservative,'' Marsha White recalled.
``His parents were arranging a marriage for him, while I had a new
boyfriend every week. He just couldn't understand that. I was so
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, one or the other would speculate about whether they
would have the opportunity to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am serious when I say that we may meet some day,''
Sukhtankar wrote in a letter dated May 31, 1966. ``Strong longings
bring about miracles in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the topics in their letters gradually shifted
from school and youthful pursuits to work and family. He married,
moved to New Bombay, opened a pharmacy and had a son.
</P>
<P>
   She worked in insurance, relocated several times with her
husband and had three girls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes months would pass without Sukhtankar and White writing
a word to each other. But then the odd Christmas or New Year's card
would arrive with updated news and photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure to write at least once a year,'' Marsha White
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles D. White turned 50 in 1992, his wife organized a
surprise birthday party and arranged for his parents and many of
his high school friends to attend. As Marsha White's 50th
approached this year _ Nov. 28 _ her husband was racking his brains
for a present that would equal the party she had thrown him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tough act to follow,'' White said of his wife, who is
famous among friends for going out of her way to make people happy.
``But then I thought of Rajendra, and I knew a trip to meet him
would be the perfect gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha White called her pen pal in India to tell him of her
impending trip. Sukhtankar and his wife, Ejeeta, responded
immediately with a recent photo so she would recognize them at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   After months of preparation and careful purchase of gifts _
perfume, New York souvenirs and some of those sweat shirts she told
him about 30 years ago _ White left Nov. 24 for her 17-hour flight
to India. She was nervous enough to take one of the tranquilizers
the doctor had given her. But when she finally arrived and spotted
her friend in the crowd, laden with bouquets of flowers, all of
White's anxiety dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he was, grinning ear-to-ear and waving my picture in the
air,'' White recalled. ``I was so excited. I started crying. We hit
it off right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in New Bombay last week, Sukhtankar said meeting his pen
pal was so exciting, so moving, that he was at a loss for words to
describe the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so wonderful,'' he said. ``Seeing her ... It was a
feeling I cannot express.''
</P>
<P>
   White spent her week taking in the sights, smells, sounds and
tastes of New Bombay. Members of Sukhtankar's family took turns
chauffeuring her from place to place. They even threw her a
birthday party, to which she wore a purple sari and had henna
decorations painted on her palms.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like the queen of India for those eight days,'' said
Charles White, who received a call from Marsha every day while she
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   It took White several days to recover from her travels, but she
is already dreaming of her next visit to India. She would like to
return in 10 years, she said, and take her husband with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiencing the culture was wonderful,'' White said. ``They
made me feel so special. If health and money allow it, I'd love to
go back.''

BERMUDA IS A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT RIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Only an hour and 50 minutes' flight away, there is this other
world. It bans billboards. It bans neon signs. And, dare I say it,
McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   The destination is Bermuda, and the speaker is Bermuda's new
minister of tourism, David Allen. Allen, who took office in
November, after a historic election that saw a new government for
the first time in 40 years. Right now, he said, ``there is a
feeling of rebirth and renewal that is positively contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   With the beginning of the new year, Allen promises that hearing
more about Bermuda and its uniqueness. ``We have a rich and vibrant
culture that spans 400 years. Visitors come back to Bermuda for the
people _ a unique amalgam of African slaves, English settlers,
native Americans, Irish, and Portuguese.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen knows what he speaks about. He's a travel writer by
profession and still maintains membership in the Society of
American Travel Writers.
</P>
<P>
   He's also quick to point out that now is a good time to visit
the island. The weather is springlike, in the low 70s; and there's
plenty to do, from golf, tennis, and walking to cultural
activities. It's a place to relax or have an active vacation, and
there are some great travel packages starting at $389 that include
air fare accommodations and some extras.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda recently was cited as one of the Top 10 Islands in the
world by Conde Nast Traveler in the magazine's 11th annual readers'
choice awards poll, and in September, Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine
named Bermuda the ``Best Island'' in the Caribbean, Bermuda and
Bahamas category.

   Winter. What was it like in Williamsburg, Va., In 1775? From
Jan. 4 to March 13, visitors to Colonial Williamsburg can discover
what it was like to live during those times. While daily life in
the Virginia capital appeared normal, beneath the surface sprouted
the seeds of unrest that would soon bear the fruit of revolution.
Visitors will meet with tradespeople and hear of arms stockpiling
and concerns about sources of materials. At the governor's home,
concerns are expressed about conflicts between the royal
authorities and colonists. And at the Tenant House, visitors meet
Rachel Whitaker, who is bedridden with the flu and hears the local
gossip from friends. For more information, call 800-HISTORY.

   Airplane travelers should be wary of taking the hormone
melatonin too often for jet lag, according the to the Travel
Medicine Service at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Available over the counter in drugstores as a food supplement,
melatonin has become a popular pill for combating sleepiness,
fatigue, and decreased mental alertness resulting from jet lag.
``Research indicates that melatonin is effective for short-term
treatment of jet lag, but we don't know yet whether long-term use
is safe,'' said Dr. Clifford Dacson, a Baylor physician. Baylor
recommends seeing your doctor for recommendations.

   Every March, some 250,000 harp seals enter Canada's Gulf of St.
Lawrence to bear their young on the vast floating ice floes just
west of the Magdalen Islands. In 1987, Canada announced a ban on
the commercial hunting of the seals, and now the International Fund
for Animal Welfare, along with Natural Habitat Adventures, is
creating a tourist industry to boost the local economy and ensure
that there is never a need to reinstate the hunt. The tours, which
offer an up-close encounter with the seal pups, are only offered
for three weeks of the year between Feb. 28 and March 20. The five-
or six-day tours begin at $1,795 and include a helicopter flight to
the seal herds, guide services, hotel accommodations, and air fare
between Halifax and the Magdalen Islands. For information, call
Natural Habitat Adventures in Colorado at 800-543-8917.

THE MAN WHO ROCKED BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPNTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The musician was besieged by admirers. Some wanted an autograph,
others hoped to touch him, and still others sought the ultimate
trophy: a lock of his jet-black hair. Meanwhile, a massive crowd
was cheering and screaming, waiting for his concert to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis ``the King'' Presley in Las Vegas? No, Johann ``the Waltz
King'' Strauss in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As we head into 1999 _ the year in which Vienna will mark the
centennial of Strauss's death with many special events _ let's look
back at the Waltz King's memorable visit to Boston in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, who had a fanatical following in America, was made an
offer he couldn't refuse: $100,000 _ the most ever paid a musician
at the time _ plus all travel expenses for himself, his wife, and
his servants, to conduct at a celebration called the World Peace
Jubilee. The event was trumpeted as ``the biggest concert of all
time in the biggest hall in the world, with the largest orchestra
and largest choir.'' Quite an inducement, but Strauss had the
jitters nonetheless. ``What if your Indians massacre me?'' he asked
the organizer, a flamboyant Irish-born entrepreneur named Patrick
Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   A huge hall had been built, with a platform for 20,000
performers and an auditorium holding more than 100,000 listeners.
The site was in St. James Park, where the Copley Plaza hotel now
stands. There were so many orchestras and choirs that 100 assistant
conductors were needed. The star, who had been improbably nicknamed
Electric Strauss for the occasion, described it this way: ``Imagine
my situation, in front of one hundred thousand wildly enthusiastic
Americans. There I stood on the highest platform. . . . Suddenly
there is a cannon shot _ a subtle hint for us twenty thousand to
begin `The Blue Danube.' I give a sign. . . . And now there begins
a terrific racket which I won't forget for as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert was a huge success, as were three smaller ones
Strauss conducted in New York a few days afterward. Everyone was
thrilled, but perhaps none more so than the people who bought those
snippets of the Waltz King's hair. Good thing they didn't know that
his valet, Stephan, had clipped them from a black Newfoundland dog
and sold them as the real thing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of the ``Blue Danube'': Grand Circle Travel, which
specializes in vacations for those 50 and over, offers a 12-day
``Blue Danube'' cruise-tour that winds past medieval castles, Old
World villages, and the rolling vineyards of Austria, Hungary,
Slovakia, and Germany on dates from May through October. What's
more, the stylish river ships include new ones custom-built for
Grand Circle Travel. Rates start at $2,095. For more information,
call 800-955-1034 or visit www.gct.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking some more of the ``Blue Danube'': Every Dec. 31, at
the stroke of midnight, the ``Blue Danube'' is played on radios all
over Austria. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: The city of Tallin is the chief port for which
country? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: ``Floribbean'' is the name of a popular and tasty kind
of Florida cooking that mixes Latin and Southern influences.
Dishes, served at many restaurants, can range from plantains with
grilled fish to watermelon salsa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``She travels grubbiest who travels light.'' _ Erma
Bombeck. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And the winner is: British Airways has been named the top airline
for inflight entertainment in 1998, according to the World Airline
Entertainment Association. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: White vinegar is a considerate traveling companion.
Travel Holiday reports that it works miracles removing stains from
juice, red wine, and coffee. It also improves a weak travel iron;
dampen creases with the vinegar before you press. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Happy birthday, Osiris: Birthday celebrations began with the
Egyptians, about 3000 BC. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh say can you sing: The national anthem of Greece has 158 verses. &QL; 
 &QL; 
They're everywhere! If you think there are a lot of motorscooters
in Florence, Italy, you're right. There are a quarter-million of
them _ an average of two per family. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Honeymoon aloha: Hawaii is the most romantic honeymoon spot,
according to a survey by Modern Bride magazine. The runners-up, in
descending order, are Tahiti, Italy, France, Jamaica, St. Lucia,
Bermuda, Fiji, Greece and Bali. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: David Ames of North Weymouth takes issue with our
referring to ``Jingle Bells'' as a Christmas ditty. He writes:
``The words . . . state quite explicitly: `What fun it is to ride
and sing a sleighing song tonight.' Now, how much sleighing gets
done before Christmas, and how much after Christmas? If you live in
any of the right places, you can sing a sleighing song straight
through until March.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Estonia. &QL;

PATRIOTS SHOULDN'T PIN THEIR HOPES ON BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Earl Weaver used to have an expression about
injured players. When you asked about one, he'd always say the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with the living,'' the former Baltimore Orioles manager
would growl in that raspy voice of his that was a product of too
many Chesterfields or whatever it was he was smoking.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Pete Carroll should take the same approach with Drew
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has given the Patriots nothing but good service this
season and for all of his six years in uniform. He has played
better than any quarterback they ever had and more courageously
than most, missing only four of a possible 95 games in his career.
That is a number topped only by Green Bay's Brett Favre over the
same time span, and who is a tougher character than the Packers'
feisty quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   This season Bledsoe went over the top in the courage-under-fire
category after breaking his right index finger in two places
against the Miami Dolphins five weeks ago. He continued to play
that night, throwing the winning touchdown pass as time was running
out, and played against Buffalo and Pittsburgh, taking his team to
two more wins despite having to throw with one of the most
important fingers a quarterback has causing him increasing problems
and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally that finger gave out in St. Louis, five days after
doctors had inserted two pins inside it to stabilize the
deteriorating joint. Bledsoe left the field with the pins out of
place early in the game, came back with a new wrap around it, and
went a dismal 5 for 17 down the stretch when he shouldn't have been
playing at all. He has sat out since.
</P>
<P>
   But after Scott Zolak's dismal 14-for-31 passing performance
against the New York Jets on Sunday, and with a playoff game
looming with Jacksonville this weekend, there is again a hue and
cry for Bledsoe to play.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is coming both from within the organization and outside
it to reinsert him in the lineup, but Carroll should ignore that
and do what a good cornerman does when his fighter has had enough.
Do not put Bledsoe in the position of having to decide his own fate
because the fighter always will choose to fight even when there's
no fight left in him.
</P>
<P>
   In such a circumstance, the good cornerman protects his fighter
from further pain and personal humiliation and makes the decision
himself that the fight is over. For this week, at least, it should
be that way for Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would never say it, Bledsoe is not yet able to play,
at least not the way he can when he's anywhere near his best. If a
healthy Zolak isn't good enough to beat the unhealthy Jaguars, so
be it. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is not the answer this time and he should be protected
from his own instincts, which always will be to play rather than
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctors clear me to play, I'll play,'' Bledsoe said
Monday. ``That's the same thing I've said all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe acknowledged there is external pressure mounting for him
to return but insisted, ``The pressure that's out there, none of
that stuff matters. I'm not going to play because, you know,
there's pressure on me to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the fans want me to play or the team wants me to play,
none of that stuff matters. If I play, it's because I want to play
and because I love to play the game. If I can play I'll play. It's
as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely Bledsoe will, as he has done in the past. But this time
Carroll must ignore that pressure from wherever it's coming _ even
if it's emanating from the owner's box _ and use his best judgment.
If he does, he will decide that Weaver is right and deal with the
living and that means Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   To do otherwise is to court disaster for his own regime
long-term and for his team's chances short-term in a winnable
playoff game, because Bledsoe's finger remains sore by his own
admission and is not anywhere near healed. The pins that were
moving in St. Louis won't take long to begin a new trek in
Jacksonville, and when they do, what do the Patriots do then?
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Bledsoe has not practiced in well over a
month and would require most of the snaps this week to get ready
for the Jaguars, thereby limiting Zolak's chances to prepare
adequately even though in all likelihood he would be pressed into
action at some point.
</P>
<P>
   As Carroll conceded Monday, ``It's really unlikely he can pull
this off. The doctors have not been real favorable, and if he can't
get his preparation time, what can we expect out of him?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could ask for some miracle, but he already did pull off
maybe a couple of those. Maybe he's used them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely the guy is going to be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Come Wedneday, Carroll should downgrade Bledsoe's status from
highly unlikely to out. He should tell the fans and the
organization that there will be no puff of smoke from the chimney
Sunday. Foxborough is not Lourdes. No medical miracles will occur
there. Drew Bledsoe is out and Scott Zolak is in and that is that.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it should be.

OUT OF RHYTHM, MIAMI IS NO SOUND MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The feeling was equal parts shock, disbelief, and
rage. Maybe Jimmy Johnson could dial up Pete Carroll and empathize
about their respective maulings on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was fuming after the Dolphins' MIA performance against
the Falcons, a 38-16 pummeling in a game in which Miami had
everything to gain and Atlanta had absolutely nothing on the line.
(Sound familiar?) Not even the consolation of having a home playoff
game Saturday against Buffalo eliminated the sting and
embarrassment for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   No one really should have been surprised by the result. Atlanta
is a terrific team, is unbeaten at home, and was the logical
favorite against a Dolphins club that is 3-5 on the road. But it
was the totality of the conquest and the utter demolition of a
supposedly strong defense that had to open eyes and cause jaws to
drop.
</P>
<P>
   No team had done to Miami what Atlanta did. The Dolphins entered
the game allowing a shade fewer than 16 points a game, the best in
the NFL. The Falcons had 21 in the first eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Atlanta overwhelmed the Dolphins with big plays.
The first play from scrimmage went for 62 yards and a touchdown,
and only one Miami player, Terrell Buckley, had even a chance to
make a tackle. He seemed uninterested in doing so, setting the tone
for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' fourth play from scrimmage went for 53 yards,
leading to another touchdown. There also was a 35-yard touchdown
pass and a 36-yard touchdown run. That's four plays of 35 yards or
more, all either resulting in a touchdown or leading to a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give up big plays like that,'' Buckley said, ``it's
tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Miami was hit hard by the loss of Jason Taylor, its
lightning-fast lineman and second-leading sacker (nine for 37
yards) who broke his collarbone in the first quarter. But that
didn't begin to address the sheer feeling of helplessness on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had allowed as many as 30 points just once all year and
was coming off an inspired performance against the Super Bowl
champion Broncos the previous Monday. The Dolphins are 1-5 when
they allow more than 20 points; 36 was a Krakatoan explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't happened to us that way since the Jacksonville
game,'' said linebacker Zach Thomas, referring to a 28-21 loss Oct.
12. ``I guess we weren't ready. But I am going to stay positive,
look at things realistically. If we had won this game and lost next
weekend, it wouldn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins didn't deserve any breaks from this one, but they
got one because the Patriots were similarly inept in New Jersey.
Thus, Miami was given a home game, and that could be huge because
the Dolphins are tough at Pro Player Stadium (an oxymoron if they
play the way they did Sunday) and are building on that as well as
forgetting the finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to have a home game,'' Dan Marino said
unconvincingly, ``but it would have been a whole lot nicer to have
won and go into the playoffs with some momentum. We better play
better against Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, that should not take much. Offensively, they have
perked up over the past several weeks, averaging 24 points over the
last five games. That's normally plenty when the team shows up to
play. If they can't do that Saturday, then Sunday's fiasco was a
perfect epitaph for their season.

EXCITEMENT BEGINS TO BUILD FOR FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He has played in bowl games, in Grey Cup games. He
has won MVP honors and been called ``magical'' as many times as
most quarterbacks who are under 6 feet and attempt to play in the
NFL have been called ``undersized.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Doug Flutie has never done is start an NFL playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon in Miami, Flutie will get that chance. To say
that he is revved up is to understate his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game,'' Flutie said with a wry grin Sunday afternoon
following a 45-33 win by the Buffalo Bills over the New Orleans
Saints at the Superdome. ``Just like a lot of other games that I've
played in.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who was a spectator in the regular-season finale _
though not by choice _ paused, and then his face broke into a wider
grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year you live for as a player,'' he went
on. ``It's single elimination. Every game counts. If you lose,
you're done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are not done, largely because of Flutie. Signed last
January at age 35, he was coming back into the NFL for some sort of
last-hurrah effort to prove that he could be more than a legend in
college, more than a multiple MVP in the wide-open Canadian
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie hardly had had time to try on a pair of shoulder pads
when the Bills signed another quarterback, Rob Johnson, to a
five-year, $25 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Johnson earning 10 times as much as Flutie _ who
agreed to a barebones contract of $250,000 laced with incentives _
but he was 11 years younger and clearly the quarterback of the
future for the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries happen in the NFL, and by the sixth game of the
year, Johnson was on the injured list with broken ribs. Flutie had
the chance for his 15 minutes of NFL fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now Flutie is still going strong, and so are the Bills, who went
from an 0-3 start to a 10-6 finish and look like they can add to
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the other quarterback who is talking about his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my role,'' said Johnson, who played for the first time
in three months against the Saints, throwing for three touchdowns
and running for another while Flutie stood and watched, nursing a
sore leg. ``For now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. For now, Flutie is the Bills' starting quarterback, and
he wants to savor every moment. Which is why he fidgeted most of
the day while the game was going on in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``I've almost never been hurt. I was
hurt once in the USFL and once in the CFL. I'm just not used to not
playing. I always play. That's what's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most frustrating thing in the world. You want to
play. That's what you do. You play football. You dress up, you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could have played, Flutie gave one of those ``you
gotta be kidding me'' looks before coming back with a quiet
response: ``Sure. The leg hurts a little, but it's no big deal. I
played with a lot worse injuries than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie sees the playoffs as the ``second season'' that everyone
talks about.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, it's not any different than in the past for
me,'' said Flutie, who has a new contract for next season that will
pay him in the neighborhood of $3 million, even though there is no
guarantee that he will be the starter. ``We're on the road in the
playoffs. The only thing that will be missing will be the cold
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to the next stage now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as usual, Doug Flutie will be center stage when it counts
the most.

THE HIKE IS FUN, AND SO IS THE HUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH A. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are looking for real adventure in the White Mountains,
visit one of the Appalachian Mountain Club huts.
</P>
<P>
   The huts are well-equipped, have great food and funny hosts. You
have to hike from two to five hours to get to them. The hikes are
not that hard, but not that easy. There are rocks, roots, hills,
and streams in the path. I would not recommend taking anyone under
age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest hut to get to is Lonesome Lake, a 1.75-mile hike.
This hike is the best for beginners. But my personal favorite is
Mizpah Springs Hut, a 2.5-mile hike that is a little harder than
Lonesome Lake but just as fun.
</P>
<P>
   After you have finished the hike, you will probably want to go
inside and buy a hot drink, such as coffee, tea, or hot cocoa. You
will be assigned to a bunk where you will be sleeping. You will
unpack, do some exploring, and probably sit at one of the long
tables and engage in a quiet activity. While you are doing all
this, the ``croo'' (the hosts, and that's how they spell it) will
be making a huge, delicious dinner with many courses and dessert.
At 6 on the dot, a croo member will ring a huge bell and the entire
croo (five or six people) will yell, ``Dinner!''
</P>
<P>
   Soon platters of hearty food will be set in front of you. After
you have eaten, some people will go to their bunks to prepare
themselves for bed and the darkness (it seems to get dark very
early because there is no electricity up there). Others will stay
downstairs and talk, play cards or a board game, or read a book
about the hut's past. (The hut supplies these things.) On some
nights after dinner, there is ``Nature Bingo'' or another quiet
game. The winner usually gets a candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you will probably go to your bunk and get in bed.
Flashlights out is around 9 p.m. The propane lights go out then,
too.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m., a croo member will come yelling through the
hallways, ``Time to get up, folks! Breakfast at 7!'' A breakfast of
oatmeal and maybe French toast or waffles or pancakes will be
served. While you are eating, the croo members will put on a funny
skit about how to fold your blankets correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you will pack up and begin your hike down the mountain.
After you have concluded your hike, you will collapse in your car
and drive home thinking about your wonderful trip in the White
Mountains.
</P>
<P>

PEI LOBSTER SUPPER _ IN SUM: YUM! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're unlovely to look at but delightful to dine upon. They're
lobsters, and nowhere is a lobster feast sweeter than on pretty
Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout summer and much of spring and fall on this Atlantic
Canada province, lobster suppers are a staple in church and
community halls and in restaurants dedicated chiefly to the cause
of the crustacean. The suppers, it seems, are as much a part of the
island as its stunning red soil and endless fields in many shades
of green.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot more than lobster is involved. There are the multitude
of scrumptious side dishes, of course. But there's the knowledge
you're participating in a tradition that dates back 40 years when
the first such supper was held to raise money for rural youngsters.
And there's the air of friendliness that's ever-present.
</P>
<P>
   So come along. Tie on a plastic bib and enjoy a dinner that even
impresses New Englanders who are used to good lobster. This one's
at Fisherman's Wharf in North Rustico.
</P>
<P>
   Even before sitting down, you're impressed by the informality
and conviviality _ the laughter and the chatting. You're also
impressed by the 60-foot salad and dessert bar and by the knowledge
that the restaurant's lobster pound can hold 45,000 pounds of the
crustaceans at a time. (That's a lot, but then again island
lobstermen haul in some 20 million pounds a year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot or cold?'' your waitress asks. She's not referring to your
disposition, though. She's merely asking how you want your lobster
served. Some diners are surprised to learn that cold is the
preferred style among islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Now's the time to accumulate some side dishes, not the least of
which are Island Blue mussels, sweet and sand-free because they're
cultivated on the sides of underwater ropes. Add to that a cup of
chowder, a tasty Prince Edward Island potato _ another product the
island is famous for _ rolls, and a frosty beverage and . . . ahhh.
</P>
<P>
   Now dig into that pound-or-more lobster, secure in the knowledge
that you're being no louder or messier than your dining companions
as you crack the claws or dip the meaty tail into melted butter.
Gourmets will relish the tomalley, or liver, but not everyone is a
gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still have room, try a slice of homemade pie or
cake or a scoop or two of ice cream to go with your coffee. Then
relax and digest while pondering the fact that hundreds and
hundreds of people are having similar meals in such places as St.
Ann's near Cavendish, St. Margaret's near Naufrage Harbour, and the
original venue, New Glasgow Lobster Suppers. The cost of the feast
at current exchange rates: about $18-$20 US.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few months before it's time for the suppers to be
held again, but to paraphrase a lyric from ``The Fantasticks'':
Deep in December, it's nice to remember the fantastic taste of a
lobster supper on Prince Edward Island.

AT THIS STEAKHOUSE, YOU'RE THE CHEF

<P>
   MOUNTOUR, Iowa _ You don't just drop in here.
</P>
<P>
   It's not on the way to anything. It's not particularly near
anything, either.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two commercial buildings in town. One is the Post
Office. The other isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The building that isn't the Post Office is Rube's Steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ambience. No decent tablecloths. No fancy wine list.
No trendy appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: no chef, either.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a huge meat locker. And three indoor grills.
Loads of charcoal. A few water sprays in case the flames get too
high. Or in case your dining partners say something stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you do at my favorite restaurant in the United
States:
</P>
<P>
   You walk in the door.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the giant meat locker.
</P>
<P>
   You choose your meal, maybe the 20-ounce Kansas City Strip
($17.95) or the 32-ounce ham steak ($14.95) or, my recommendation,
the 26-ounce T-bone ($18.95).
</P>
<P>
   Then you walk into the next room. You slap the steak on the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   You pick up a piece of white bread (and admit it: You don't get
white bread nearly as often as you'd like anymore). You slather it
with butter (no dainty tastes-like-butter substitute that doesn't
taste at all like butter). You drop the bread on the grill, too.
</P>
<P>
   You poke the steak. You stuff your bread in your mouth. You turn
the steak over a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   Then you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this as dinner without the middleman (the waitstaff).
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as home cooking (if you were at home, after all,
you'd do the cooking yourself).
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as an opportunity to spend some quality time with
the chef. (That would be you).
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the best steak you had in years. (It's done the
way you like it because you did it yourself. And, of course, if you
don't like the way your steak is done, you know exactly whom to
blame.)
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have the T-bone or the ham steak or the Kansas
City Strip. It's not as if there are no choices at Rube's.
</P>
<P>
   You could have the 20-ounce ribeye. That would be respectable.
Also, reasonable at $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   You could have the beef kabob. It seems to weigh about 75
pounds, and there are even a couple of vegetables tucked in there,
unobtrusively, so as not to affront your expectations. Maybe your
best buy at $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   You could order the chicken kabob. Or the chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   The pork chops are good. You would figure that, this being Iowa.
A reviewer from the Des Moines Register once said that the flavor
of the chop had the addictive quality of potato chips. Maybe not
the sort of compliment you get from the chief restaurant reviewer
of The New York Times, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   You could even order just the salad bar. But ordering the salad
bar at Rube's is about as rare as impeaching the president in
Washington. Once every 130 or so years, somebody comes in and does
it.
</P>
<P>
   They have doggie bags. Most people bring home enough to feed a
brontosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   You can also bring home extra steaks. The meat locker for the
take-home steaks is right there at the reception desk. They have a
sense of style here.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order by phone (800-84-RUBES). The other day the
meat manager told me that someone ordered 200 steaks. I believe
him. Maybe that person ate them all at a single sitting. When you
look around the dining room here and see how the people shove it
in, you'll think that maybe 200 steaks isn't out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The place has been around for a quarter-century. Since before
they tried to impeach Nixon. It's really crowded at the holidays
and after Iowa football games. Also during hunting season. But you
guessed that.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Blocker, the manager, orders 70 twenty-pound bags of
charcoal a week. Running out of charcoal at Rube's is like running
out of tartar sauce at Woodman's fried-clam window. Can't have
that.
</P>
<P>
   The meat comes from all over Iowa. Now that you mention it, so
do the diners, by and large. (Mostly large. They leave a little
larger than they came in.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shide, the meat manager, is a talkative fellow, but there's
no way you can get him to tell you where the meat comes from.
Believe me, I tried. (I'm a trained interviewer. In my day I once
got Bob Dole to give me a complete sentence.) Old Mark's terrified
that competitors will find out. Not that there's a competitor
within, say, 35 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Won't tell you how many heads of cattle go through the joint,
either.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave me one of the best quotes I've had in nearly 30
years of newspapering. It's one for the ages: ``We don't take a
whole carcass. We take only the best part _ the loins and the ribs.
That's only 20 percent of the weight of the beef carcass.'' Thank
you for sharing, Mark. Carcass is not a word a political writer
uses every day. Good to remember that it takes more than one ``s.''
</P>

JUST A NAME ON EMILY'S LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it ends up that Emily Rooney thinks I'm dull, a revelation
likely to inspire two questions in anyone who knows me or has read
anything I've written _ the first being: Why waste time stating the
obvious? And the second: Who's Emily Rooney?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer to question two is, she's the highly-acclaimed
former news director at Channel 5 TV in Boston who went on to land
the prestigious post as executive producer for ABC-TV's ``World
News Tonight,'' only to leave of someone else's volition seven
months later. Now she's the host of the nightly Channel 2 show
``Greater Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   To the first question, I can only ask, me, dull? Well, I never.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about me. Let's talk about Emily Rooney talking about
me. It must have been a week ago Friday when she made this comment
on the air. I happened to miss it because I was readjusting the
shoe trees in my wingtips, something I like to do every week or so,
usually just before I fire up the old CB radio and read my own
whacky brand of open-road poetry to long haul truckers fighting off
the ravages of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   I got a tape, though, and in between Animal Kingdom reruns, I
plugged it into the VCR, and there she was, Emily Rooney, calling
me dull, not just once, but a few times, and not just any kind of
dull, but ``exceedingly dull.'' Boston advertising executive and
``Greater Boston'' commentator John Carroll _ henceforth known as
the highly respected John Carroll _ had just done his own somewhat
flattering critique of myself and new columnist colleague Adrian
Walker. I'd be embarrassed to write here what he said, but call me
if you'd like the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Emily. ``Dull is another word that comes to mind,''
she says, flashing that finishing school smile of hers. After the
other panelists hemmed and hawed that maybe passing judgment on the
first few columns was a trifle unfair, she added, ``I do think that
these were exceedingly dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that made me wonder. So I contemplated calling my
ex-wife, a woman of considerable bluntness, which partially
explains the prefix ex. But I realized what she would have told me:
``On your best day you're dull. You aspire to be dull. You give the
word dull a bad name . . .'' Click. So instead I could have called
my mother, but suddenly it occurred to me she doesn't take my calls
anymore. I wonder why. My boss? Well, everyone in here is on
vacation but me, mostly because I don't have anyplace to go.
</P>
<P>
   I did think about taking a few days off this week to learn how
to shape linen napkins into swans and other animals, like the
waiters did on that Big Red Boat cruise to nowhere I was on a few
years back, figuring it would be an enchanting trick to perform at
a party sometime, should I ever get invited to one.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Here I am, trying to figure out how not to be dull. For
that, maybe I should look to Emily Rooney. She's so smart, maybe
she can help.
</P>
<P>
   First off, I come to find out she's the daughter of that lovable
curmudgeon Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes. That's exciting. But I'm not
entirely convinced that having an accomplished or famous relative
can insulate anyone from dullness.
</P>
<P>
   Then I learn that Emily herself was reviewed by the Globe and
Herald in January 1997, back when ``Greater Boston'' first appeared
on the air. The reviews were a little less flattering than they
might have been. But what was truly interesting was Emily's
response. In an interview with the Improper Bostonian, she lashed
out at Herald TV columnist Monica Collins, a first-rate critic, for
her physique and psychology, accusing her of being jealous of
``people who are more attractive and slimmer than she is.'' And in
a letter faxed to Collins, Emily wrote, ``Meanwhile, with my
anxiety level at a maximum over the past six months, I've dropped
12 pounds. And you?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh my. That's certainly not dull. Maybe that explains why Emily
still seemed to be fuming that night she called me dull. She
seethed, ``Nobody's ever revisited this show after almost two years
on the air, after they blew us out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. I think I get it. I should lash out. I should be brutal,
vicious even, and the more personal, the better. If I'm
embarrassing myself and my newspaper, that's alright; anything in
the name of not being dull. So how's this: Hey Emily, murder
fugitives can hide out on the guest panel of ``Greater Boston''
without fear of being seen. Hey Emily, maybe the highly respected
John Carroll should be the host.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the hell with it. It's the holidays. And Emily's a smart
woman. Maybe the proper thing is to just thank her for her counsel
and say that one of these nights, I hope to put my CB poetry aside
in time to catch her enlightening show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Steven Booth arrives in his office, his cubicle really,
shortly before 9 a.m., and already he's been working on his laptop
on the commuter train from Salem, checking the production schedule
for the day. He puts his takeout coffee on one side of his computer
and his laptop on the other and flips on his terminal. No papers
clutter his desk, and he carefully makes sure his stapler is in its
proper place. He has no pictures on his walls, no family
photographs on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Booth is a blind man leading the blind _ and the sighted _ in
his job as production coordinator for the National Braille Press
Inc. On this day, he tracks some 100 jobs, from getting
transcribers started on a braille reprint of a user's guide to the
Macintosh version of the Duxbury Braille Translator to making sure
a mailing of 2,044 braille copies of the latest issue of the
religious magazine Discovery is ready for pickup.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, braille literacy among the blind was on the
decline, the result of the movement to educate blind children in
public schools rather than special residential schools and of the
notion that the rise of books-on-tape and talking computers made
reading raised dots obsolete. In 1997, 5,400 children and teens
used braille as their primary reading method, down from 9,000 in
1963, according to the American Printing House for the Blind. Now,
after years of advocacy by the blind, 30 states, including
Massachusetts, have enacted laws requiring that blind children be
taught braille, and last year Congress passed similar legislation.
The braille numbers in recent years have begun inching up again.
</P>
<P>
   National Braille Press, founded in 1927 and tucked between
Northeastern University and Symphony Hall, is one of five presses
in the country authorized to produce books in braille for the
Library of Congress. Of 33 employees, 13 are blind or legally
blind. The press does $1.2 million in contract work a year and also
publishes its own material, including cookbooks and computer guides
and print-braille children's books in which transparent plastic
pages of braille inserted between printed pages enable sighted
parents and teachers to introduce blind youngsters to braille as
they read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Booth oversees all these operations. He's been blind since he
was born prematurely 45 years ago, and the oxygen used to aid his
nascent lungs destroyed his vision. He was introduced to braille at
5 when his parents enrolled him in the Perkins School for the Blind
in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   First order of business on this particular morning is to enter
the new Duxbury Translator job on his computer, aided by a device
that converts what's on the screen to speech. Project due in 20
working days. Booth's fingers fly over a braille calendar. He
enters Jan. 18 in his data base.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is an old DOS model because the graphics-heavy
Windows system is tough to convert to speech. But DOS is obsolete,
so Booth has a Windows computer at home and a talking screen reader
he bought for $800. ``I'm hoping by the time we convert here I'll
know something about it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That Optacon scanner on Booth's office desk is obsolete, too. He
runs a scanning wand over a printed page and puts his other hand in
a small device that looks like a nail dryer and converts the
scanned words into braille. It's how Booth tells whether a printed
cover is in the proper spot on a page. It's no longer made, so
there will be no replacing it when it breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking forward to that. It saves me a lot of sighted
help I don't need,'' Booth says. ``I'll have to learn to do it
another way as I've done so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is the transcription room upstairs. Booth puts the
strap of his Braille Lite around his neck and reaches for his cane.
He has the job order in hand, detailed once in computer printout
and once in a braille note he punched with the brailler on his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Braille Lite is a $3,300 notebook-sized laptop with six
keys, one for each position on the six-dot braille cell, and a
braille display. This is how Booth reads the climatological report
he downloads each morning before he leaves home because he's
fascinated by weather. It's where he keeps the files that he works
on while riding the train, where he has a copy of the book
``Getting to Yes'' he's reading and the copy of ``Charlotte's Web''
on disk that he's testing. It is especially handy because braille
is bulky. Not only must it be printed on paper thick enough to hold
raised dots on both sides, but a page of print often fills as much
as two pages in braille.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the desk of chief transcriber Melissa Hirshson and
you know she can see. Her purse lies strewn atop a haphazard stack
of papers, and there's barely room for the unopened Nestle Crunch
bar on her desk. Hirshson has been interested in braille since she
wrote a report in fifth grade on Helen Keller.
</P>
<P>
   She tells Booth she's transcribing the book ``Don't Scream.''
She's cut the pages and run them through a scanner, and now she's
proofreading the text on her screen because sometimes the scanner,
top of the line as it is, misses things. The ideal situation is
when the printed material is already on disk. Next Hirshson will
convert the text to braille using Duxbury Translator software, and
from that a metal plate will be embossed in braille, all of which
is much easier than the days when braille transcription was done by
key punch by hand.
</P>
<P>
   In comes chief proofreader Christopher Devin, who reads paper
proofs of the embossed braille plates before the plates go to
press. He works with headphones and fingers in an unlit room next
to the transcribers, guided by taped text read by readers who
mention every punctuation mark. Sometimes a dot on the embosser
doesn't fire, and it's important to catch those mistakes before a
book is printed. A braille version of Webster's New World
Dictionary fills 72 volumes and one wall of the proofreaders' room.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, Devin, who is blind, tells Booth the status of
various jobs. ``Superfine Valentine'' is ready. So is Syndicated
Columnists Weekly. Melissa's working on ``Don't Scream.'' They
haven't started ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' As Devin reads his
braille list, Booth types the information into his Braille Lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blindness can be reduced to an inconvenience. The production
management I do here has nothing to do with me being blind,'' Booth
says. ``But I don't want to make it trivial. It's at once an
inconvenience and it's all consuming. You can't spend your life
meditating on it. You wouldn't get to the fun stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Booth's office, printer Khith Nhem, who operates ink and
braille presses, delivers his status report. Nhem is leaving for
vacation and Booth wants as many ink jobs as possible done by then
because ink always precedes braille. Otherwise a second run through
a press would crush the raised dots.
</P>
<P>
   Underfoot, Booth can hear the rumble of the braille presses
downstairs. ``We call it the heartbeat of the press,'' Booth says.
``If you don't hear it, something is not going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is the bindery upstairs, where hardcover braille books
are bound, as many as 250 braille pages per volume. The ``Better
Homes and Garden New Cookbook'' fills 11 volumes. Piles of unbound
pages of ``Inner Chimes,'' a book of children's poetry, line a long
table, awaiting the insertion of clear braille pages. Each month,
the press prints 500 to 600 of these print-braille children's
books, then offers them for the same price as bookstores sell the
print version. The other 75 percent of the cost to produce these
books comes from fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Booth has held this job since 1994, after working for six years
in technical support for Xerox Imaging Systems, traveling the
country training sales representatives. He's worked in customer
service at a bank, screened callers for radio talk shows, and
staffed a library's talking-book section. ``Coming here, I have a
career,'' he says, ``Braille is still here. We're going strong, so
likely this will be a good job for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Booth checks the ground floor pressroom, where John
Daniels is running 3,500 copies of the Blazie Engineering catalog
on a converted ink press with blotters to cushion the braille
plates. To print braille legibly on two sides of a page, the plates
must be misaligned by precisely 1/16 of an inch. Once the pages are
printed, they await collating in stacks of 50. Any more pages in a
pile and the braille would be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   In the cavernous room beside the pressroom, Daniels's wife,
Dorothy, supervises the collating operations. Everyone in this
department has some kind of disability, and everyone, even the
blind, rotates through all the jobs, including running the
stitching machine, which is the only station Daniels insists on a
no-talking rule. Daniels herself, her eyes distorted behind thick
glasses, has been legally blind since she was injured in an
automobile accident at the age of 10. She's on schedule for getting
``Discovery'' magazine out the door, she tells Booth, but she could
sure use another postal crib to store them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work here,'' says Booth, ``is sometimes exciting and
sometimes boring. It's exhilarating if you produce a product that
people like.''

COMPLETING ELGAR'S WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In 1934 Edward Elgar, mortally ill, asked his friend William
Reed to burn the sketches for the Third Symphony the composer knew
he would not live to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Reed did not comply with Elgar's request. Instead he reproduced
a substantial number of the sketches in his memoir, ``Elgar As I
Knew Him,'' published a year after the composer's death. The actual
sketches went into the British Library, with a stern prohibition
against any attempt to alter or complete them.
</P>
<P>
   But now Elgar estate has withdrawn its objections, and the
British composer Anthony Payne has completed this last work. Payne
describes the Third Symphony as an ``elaboration'' of Elgar's
sketches. Now the new work the old master seems poised to enter the
international repertory. 62 performances have been taken place or
been scheduled since the premiere by Andrew Davis and the BBC
Symphony last year; a recording has appeared on the NMC label. NMC
has also issued a very interesting supplementary disc containing a
lecture about the work by Payne illustrated by performances of
nearly all the material in the sketches so that the listener can
understand exactly what he had to do to complete the work _ what
Elgar left and what Payne made of it. The lecture is also quite
candid; Payne admits there are bits of music in the sketches he
couldn't find a place for _ although Elgar himself would certainly
not have used up every notation in the sketches. We cannot know for
sure what Elgar would have done, but it is certain that Payne has
done something noble and thoroughly Elgarian _ Payne knows his
Elgar, which means he has to spring some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Payne was in this country last month for the American premiere
by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and he spoke by phone about this
unusual and somewhat controversial project.
</P>
<P>
   Elgar, who had written little of importance after the death of
his wife in 1920, was urged to compose a Third Symphony by his
friend George Bernard Shaw, who had a hand in persuading the BBC to
commission the work. Elgar worked vigorously on the piece, drawing
ideas and thematic materials from earlier uncompleted or
diversionary works (an oratorio called ``The Last Judgment,'' never
completed; incidental music to a play by Laurence Binyon,
``Arthur'') as was his usual custom. There is reason to believe
that much of the symphony was substantially worked out in Elgar's
head, and he would storm through parts of it at the piano, with
Reed tagging along on the violin; he would urge Reed to ``play his
heart out.'' Among the helpful materials in the sketches are the
violin parts Elgar wrote out for Reed, and on the lecture CD
violinist Robert Gibbs plays on Reed's own instrument to the
accompaniment of David Owen Norris's piano. But Elgar didn't get
all of the symphony written down, and what he did write out is not
always clear, or in order _ parts of the sketches form a kind of
jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Payne was originally drawn to the sketches by Reed's book; he
prepared a BBC lecture on the sketches, and even arrived at a
provisional completion of the slow movement before the Elgar family
said they could not violate the composer's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly, however'' Paye says, ``they changed their minds as we
got to know each other. At every point in the process they were
very courteous; they were sorry to refuse permission. In the end,
the family bit the bullet because of the copyright situation. By
2005 Elgar will be in the public domain, and anybody can do
anything he wants to with the music. Rather than let anything
unfortunate happen, they preferred to give me permission _ it was
that rather than any `higher good' or `giving Elgar's last thoughts
to the world' that motivated them. The family has come in for
attack; they have been accused of `feeding off the rotten corpse of
Elgar.' But they're putting all the money from the Third Symphony
into a scholarship for a young composer; nobody is going to grow
rich on the dead body of the great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne says that one great lesson of the Third Symphony is ``that
it gives the lie to the received opinion that the old boy was dried
up creatively. There's an entirely new tone of voice in this
symphony, and people have been astonished by it. Some of them have
even said they thought it was coming from me. But what atonished
them was absolutely what Elgar wrote out in full score, the first
20 bars or so _ a section that proved a jolly useful platform for
me to work from. It's a new Elgar and the opening of the symphony
sounds like a piece from the 1930s _ it sounds a bit like
Hindemith, but you can hear that it's by Elgar.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a growing fascination in recent years with
finishing works left incomplete by their creators. Familiar legal
and moral arguments have been made against this. Some contemporary
composers also object because the process deflects attention from
really new work _ it is giving us new old repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that part of the argument,'' Payne says,
``although it involves arguing against what i've done. As a
composer, I think one of the sicknesses of our age is obsession
with the past. One thing that has come out of that is writing
pieces about other pieces, music with quotation marks around it.
There's something a bit sick about that instead of writing music
from the gut, music about feeling and emotion. Now of course I've
gone and done it myself _ but I'm not going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who was born in 1936, has produced a considerable
catalogue of high-quality music. He is married to the British
new-music soprano Jane Manning, who has appeared on several
occasions with the Boston Musica Viva; Richard Pittman and BMV have
also performed works by Payne. The composer welcomes any additional
attention the Elgar elaboration will bring to his own compositions.
``People are saying `Now we must have another look at Payne's
music.' Whether or not this attention will lead in the near future
to all that much more activity on my behalf, I can't say, but it
has helped people think that I belong to the tradition of English
music. To marry the English romantics to the continental
avant-garde _ that's my role in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne says the process of completing the Elgar Third is quite
different from the effort several musicians have brought to
Mahler's 10th Symphony, which was alos left unfinished. ``The
Mahler 10th presents a totally different problem. The continuity is
all there, but the textures are extremely sparse. In the Elgar
Third it's the other way round _ the sketches are more complete
texturally, but you have to place them together like the pieces of
a puzzle. And I had to do more actual composing; I had to write the
last 2/3 of the finale myself. But after hearing the work all these
times, I have no second thoughts _ I really think I've nailed it.
I'm pleased with it, and would never change any of it. That's it.
If another 20 pages of sketches were to turn up, I think I'd be
tempted to burn them. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Response to the Elgar Third has been fervent and emotional;
Elgar is a composer whose music means much to his countrymen.
``People do love their Elgar, and they have been very touchingly
grateful for this effort. Andrew Davis leapt in the air and shouted
`Yes!' the first time I showed him the completed score, and since
then it's become one of his favorite pieces. It is such a physical
piece that musicians like playing it. Another good thing is that
it's not as difficult as the First and Second Symphonies; amateur
orchestras and youth orchestras can get round it and do a moving
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne says he feels his life has been changed by his work on the
sketches. ``I've very proud of having done this for Elgar, who is
one of my spiritual father figures. We have been able to look at
this music in a book for years. It's wonderful that people can now
hear this music.''

GET DOWN TO BASICS FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A good night's sleep can easily be interrupted by
cold, frosty weather if it leaves you shivering in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a two- or three-dog night (when it's so cold that you
let the pets repose with you for extra warmth), one of the best
insulators is a down comforter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy sleeping environment is a cool one at around 65,''
said Rob Hayes, general merchandise manager for Coming Home, the
bed and bath division of Lands' End in Dodgeville, Wis. ``This cuts
down on bacteria that survive in warm, moist conditions. Therefore
you should have a proper covering to keep you warm and
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may be under the misconception that a comforter
has to be heavy to keep you warm, but it doesn't,'' Hayes said.
``On the contrary, down comforters can be very light because of
their down insulation and not give you that bogged-down feeling
that you get with several layers of blankets, yet keep you even
toastier.''
</P>
<P>
   These puffy clouds of insulation are filled with the down found
along the breast of white, mature farm-raised ducks and geese. The
goose down plumules (each cluster made up of thousands of tiny
feathery fibers radiating from a central point), are larger,
loftier and stronger than duck down. The more down clusters and the
fewer the feathers, the better the down. (Down is for insulation,
feathers are for flight.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Down comforters are made from white goose down, gray goose and
duck down,'' said Nancy Koltes, president of the retail division of
Scandia Down in New York. ``It's the type of down used that affects
the comforter's weight and cost, like the difference between a
Rolls-Royce and an inexpensive compact car.''
</P>
<P>
   Duck down may simply be called down, but only goose down can be
labeled goose down, Hayes said. A top-quality down comforter will
have at least 80 percent of its fill (amount of space gauged in
cubic inches that the down can fill) from whole down clusters,
which will be listed on the sewn-on tag.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, a product can contain as little as 20 percent to be
labeled as down.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coming Home and other manufacturers, the very
finest down has a fill power of 750 cubic inches per ounce, and the
lowest is around 300 per ounce. Down products with a count of 500
or more are considered worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less than 400 fill power adds weight without adding
much warming ability.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers state the fill power on the label. The higher the
number, the warmer the comforter, which in turn requires less down,
making for a lighter comforter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When buying off-the-shelf in department stores, the consumer
often buys a down comforter that's warmer than they need,'' Koltes
said. ``Therefore, it's important to know all you can about down
before buying a comforter or seek the advice of an experienced
reputable bedding company, so that you get a comforter that will
perform the way you need it to. The most luxurious down comforters
are the lightest.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to know what kind of down you are buying. For
instance, according to Koltes, an all-season comforter will not
have a high fill power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the soft fluff of these clusters that insulates by
trapping warm air from your body,'' Hayes said. ``Down also
breathes, unlike a synthetic comforter, allowing moisture to wick
out and keep your body cooler as the temperature goes up.
Therefore, a lightweight down comforter would afford perfect
comfort in a warm climate.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet government standards, all down is cleaned,
sanitized and sorted by weight before being used in comforters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody allergic to dirt or other animal protein should use
caution when using a down comforter, or depending on the severity
of their allergies, not use one at all,'' said Mary Brasler,
director of programs for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of
America in Washington, D.C. ``If you have a comforter, you should
encase it in a hypo-allergenic dust-mite-proof casing that gets
washed on a regular basis in water 130 or hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   A down comforter is an investment, so you can expect to pay more
for a goose down comforter than those constructed of cotton and/or
synthetic blends, which are also not as warm as down, lack a lot of
loft and tend to mat down in time.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.: ... his cause.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what exactly is Larry Flynt's cause? Ask him if he is
investigating GOP sexcapades because he is a Clinton partisan, a
shameless self-promoter, or a lampooner of the mainstream media's
tabloid tendencies, and he says simply: ``all of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very complicated guy,'' says Hustler executive editor
Allan MacDonell. ``He's not someone who has only one motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into numbing Appalachian poverty, Flynt is certainly driven
by a love of lucre. Aside from his magazine empire, which includes
a number of ``adult titles'' and dozens of more mainstream
publications, he owns several Hustler stores and will soon open a
gaming parlor in Gardena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable display of chutzpah, Flynt recently asked
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott if she would sell him the ball
club. ``I was as serious as a heart attack,'' says Flynt. The way
he tells it, Flynt asked his friend, Atlanta Braves owner Ted
Turner, to sound out baseball commissioner Bud Selig on that
possiblity. ``No way you'd be approved,'' was the answer. Still
Flynt continues to insist that ``I could have put the deal
together.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seems likely that Flynt's mucking around in Washington
scandal can only help his bottom line. ``Huckster is your word,''
says Isaacman of Flynt's P. T. Barnumesque qualities. ``He is a
very, very savvy marketing genius. He can take a situation and see
how to market it, how to promote it.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Flynt also enjoys seeing the mainstream media squirm
as they come to grips with his emerging role in a scandal they
helped foment. He is still bitter that ``the media never gave me
the recognition'' he says he deserved for winning a landmark 1988
Supreme Court case, beating a suit the Rev. Jerry Falwell filed
after Hustler parodied the idea of the Moral Majority leader having
sex with his mother in an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is driven by economics,'' Flynt says, ``and I want
to vomit when I hear some of the grand old men of journalism step
to the podium talking about integrity. . . . The media is a
monster. It's out of control. It's profit driven.''
</P>
<P>
   On this score, he has some reluctant allies. ``I think what he's
doing is very, very disturbing _ to offer a bounty on the private
lives of public people,'' says media critic Jon Katz. But this
focus on private behavior ``is really something that the serious
media has started,'' adds Katz. ``Flynt is making an ironic
statement about journalism. He has always basically existed to
puncture hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is indisputable is that Flynt is drawn to the subject of
sex like a moth to a flame. In casual conversation, he mentions his
idea to tear down the John Wayne statue in front of his building
and replace it with a fountain in the shape of male genitalia. His
March Hustler issue, yet to hit the stands, banners the nude photos
``of radio's tightest prude.'' In a coup that parlays the hypocrisy
issue with celebrity skin, Flynt has procured dirty pics of radio
moralizer Dr. Laura Schlessinger that originally appeared on the
Internet. He is pleased, but quick to insist that Dr. Laura will
not have the drawing power of Hustler's famous 1975 nude Jackie
Onassis paparazzi photos that helped put it on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt explains that he could actually increase his company's
value by de-emphasizing his dirty magazines (the only ads they
attract are the 900-number ``hot cheap sex talk'' variety), but he
then extinguishes the thought.
</P>
<P>
   He says the quarter-century-old Hustler, with a purported
circulation of about 1 million, ``is my baby. That's where I got my
start. . . . I'm not looking for respectablility.''

   In January, Flynt will return to Cincinnati _ where he was
initially convicted of pandering obscenity 21 years ago _ to stand
trial on similar charges. ``That was the only major city in America
where (Hustler) wasn't being sold,'' says Flynt. So a little over a
year ago, he opened a Hustler store there. Now, he faces the
prospect of jail time. ``I always felt that if something is not
worth going to jail for, it's not worth very much,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out why a middle-aged, affluent Flynt would
still go to the wall for the right to disseminate smut in one
Midwestern city is tricky business. ``I have a lot of compassion
for Larry Flynt and I feel sorry for him,'' says Burress. ``I think
what motivates Larry Flynt is hate. I think the man has a deep hate
for women.'' In a famous 1997 New York Times op-ed piece, Gloria
Steinem agreed, assailing Hustler for subjecting women to
``degradations from bestiality to sexual slavery. . . . Let's be
clear: A pornographer is not a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier Globe story, writer Camille Paglia saw Flynt as a
raw truth teller. ``If he's a hero, it's in that he forces people
to confront their own buried snobbery about the South and
working-class culture,'' she said. ``I'm always complaining about
white upper-class bias. It's almost easier for people to defend
(Penthouse publisher Bob) Guccione or (Playboy's Hugh) Hefner than
to defend Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt himself is most at ease when he speaks of marketing sex to
the masses. ``Ever since the Victorian era, the rich and privileged
have always hid their leather-bound edition of pornography,'' he
says. ``Now the elite can no longer control information. Down
through history, people were controlled by controlling
information.''
</P>
<P>
   On this subject, Flynt's slow and halting speech patterns
suddenly smooth out and the words flow in an easy, effortless
stream. Whatever he really is _ hero or scum, misogynist or
free-speech crusader, vapid voyeur or hater of hypocrisy _ Larry
Flynt clearly sees himself as a warrior on a sexual battlefield
where there is never any cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Flynt contemplates how he will detonate his sexual bombshells
about Washington pols (Hustler's MacDonell wants to call it ``The
Flynt Report'' in honor of the Starr report), it's worth noting
that he's enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame on numerous occasions. The
obscenity trials, the shooting that paralyzed him, the Falwell
lawsuit, and Forman's biopic all elevated him from the world of
close-up crotch shots into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a stunning Washington scandal has afforded him another
opportunity to play mind games with our confused public morality,
conjuring up the line in ``The People Vs. Larry Flynt'' that Flynt
uttered upon returning to work after major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pervert is back.''

PORTLAND'S FAMED BEHEMOTH OF BOOKSTORES KEEPS GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The two weddings were fine, one with 15 folks
in the Rose Room amid the books on cooking, the other in the Purple
Room with 50 people beside the histories. But then came the recent
e-mail from someone who wanted to mark another life passage at
Powell's Books.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to have his ashes interred in the bookstore. It was a
place he loved during his lifetime, so why not just stay there
forever? Call it the eternal bookstore browse.
</P>
<P>
   The request did have its logic. Powell's, probably the largest
bookstore in the United States and maybe the world, bills itself as
the ``City of Books.'' And this Northwest institution boasts many
features of a city, being open 365 days a year, purveying food for
the stomach and the intellect, requiring a map to navigate its real
estate, having its codes and legends.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the man's request to be interred at Powell's was
declined, it does indicate how the people of Portland and elsewhere
feel about this wondrous fiefdom of bookdom.
</P>
<P>
   As Julie Mancini, executive director of Portland Arts &AMP;
Lectures, has often said, ``If there's a new edition of the Bible,
people expect God to be at Powell's to sign books.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Joanna Rose, who worked at the store for 12 years before
leaving recently, ``People just love Powell's. When people come in,
they exhibit a real sense of ownership and treat it more like a
library than a store. People feel `this is our bookstore' and that
makes them so proud.''
</P>
<P>
   They will soon have even more of Powell's to love, honor and
cherish.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition will begin in a few weeks on the northwest portion of
the store, which will be replaced by what is jokingly referred to
as ``Powell's Tower 2000.'' This four-story addition will increase
the size of the 43,000-square-foot store by almost 60 percent and
allow it to have 1 million volumes under one roof, as well as new
sites for its popular author readings and its overcrowded rare-book
room.
</P>
<P>
   This major expansion is happening during the dreariest of days
for independent booksellers. They keep losing so much market share
to the big-bucks chain superstores and Internet purveyors that many
independents are imperiled (including Seattle's Elliott Bay Book
Co.) and many others have been forced to close (including three in
downtown Portland).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Powell, the 58-year-old owner of Powell's, has this
explanation for the expansion: ``We're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Powell's has become a behemoth by dashing convention.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's was started in 1971 by a retired painting contractor _
Michael's father, Walter _ who did not know better. So he mixed
paperbacks and hardbacks on the same shelves in his used bookstore,
which grew prodigiously as the store bought more and more books
from customers.
</P>
<P>
   He later decided to put new books on the same shelves. Powell's
now boasts editions of ``Moby Dick'' ranging from a used paperback
at $1.95 to an American first edition at $12,000 (the store's most
expensive book), with dozens of editions in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Powell is only honoring that why-not spirit with
Powell's expansion. And despite joking about being crazy, this
unassuming but outspoken figure allows that there are practical
reasons for expanding the ultimate superstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're maxed out in our space and have more inventory to expose
to our customers,'' Powell says. ``Besides, we're selling more
books on the Internet, so we could either put more books in
warehouses or the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   As Miriam Sontz, City of Books manager, adds: ``We could stand
pat, or we could do something daring.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's hardly looks like a place to foment such daring. The
City of Books sprawls over an entire Portland city block
(two-thirds the size of a Seattle block), a collection of
industrial-grade buildings that once housed a Rambler dealership
and a car-repair shop on the section of West Burnside that was
Portland's original auto row.
</P>
<P>
   The store's atmosphere is utilitarian, more warehouse than
living room, with concrete floors, wooden bookshelves, nooks and
crannies on many levels. The mammoth emporium is divided into seven
color-coded rooms, with 122 sections and 4,000 subsections,
alphabetized by author.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that staffers refer to the entrance area of
Powell's as ``the duh zone,'' since many of Powell's 3,000 daily
visitors (including many tourists) seem dumbstruck about how to
proceed any farther. They stop in their tracks, stare at overhead
signage, scratch their heads before finally heading to the
information desk.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the info ``donut'' sits Shelley Brennan, who
uses her six years at Powell's to answer a dizzying array of
inquiries: A book to translate Bosnian and Croatian? A cash
machine? A new translation of ``The Odyssey?'' The restrooms? Books
with photos of fireplaces? Jewish calendars? Maps of the Oregon
Coast?
</P>
<P>
   The cheerful Brennan directs most customers without pause,
usually sending them on their way with copies of Powell's free
full-color map, which unfolds to 17 by 22 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan alternates work at the ``donut'' with work in the
dictionary section, her great love of books evident in what she
does, as it is with many of Powell's 220 main-store employees, an
educated and eclectic corps of laid-back bibliophiles in rough-hewn
attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the colleague who once said that `Powell's is the
best dead-end job in Portland,''' Brennan relates. ``There's a
level of comfort and civility in this store. People seek refuge
here, interesting people. Something keeps us here, even though it
is difficult to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaries, which start near minimum wage, remain a sticking point
with employees at this bookstore that has long prided itself on its
progressive employment practices and its liberal political
activism. A yearlong petition drive to join the Longshoreman's
Union is now quietly under way at Powell's, much to the chagrin of
Powell and managers who consider it ``a mistake,'' especially in
perilous times for bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its plans to expand, despite its robust annual sales of
more than $30 million, despite its stock far beyond any Barnes &AMP;
Noble or Borders, despite its six smaller stores in Portland, this
is not Fortress Powell, at least according to the man whose name is
on the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've felt the impact of chain stores in our new book sales,''
Powell says. ``At best, they're flat. ... These are depressing
times. With every new Barnes &AMP; Noble that's built, there's more
redividing of the pie. Not many independent stores can survive
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's survival is built on used books, which keep increasing
in sales and now account for half of the store's take. Used books
have higher profit margins and usually incur no shipping charges,
although Powell's does buy the entire stock of closing bookstores
around the country. And its vast store of used books means Powell's
often has books found almost nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   This is the source of many legends surrounding Powell's, tales
that sometimes seem apocryphal but often come from well-known
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin found Abraham Lincoln books in
Powell's that she had not seen in Cambridge, Mass. British writer
Doris Lessing found several books at Powell's that she had sought
for years.
</P>
<P>
   And a skeptical Carlos Fuentes came to Powell's, located in an
American city that ranks 30th in population, with a test list of
five fiendishly obscure titles seldom found on any bookstore
shelves. The widely traveled Mexican writer had found only two
bookstores in the world with two of the titles. Powell's had four.
</P>
<P>
   The key players in Powell's phenomenal selection are its 30
used-book buyers, who take turns at the long counter by the front
door and pronounce their verdict on the stacks of books brought in
by hopeful sellers. Some 5,000 books are bought every day, but many
are rejected, often to the disappointment of those who have lugged
them in.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's used-book buyers, who train for at least two years,
have a computer for backup, as well as price guides for used and
rare books. But, as veteran buyer Allen B. Lloyd says, the best
reference is his head. So he quickly accepts and rejects books,
with sellers receiving one-third of Powell's sale price in cash, or
20 percent more in store credit.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd loves books and his job. ``What else are you going to do
with a B.A. in English?'' he says. ``This can be intellectually
stimulating and it's not flipping burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old buyer does his business with a brisk efficiency,
partly because of how many books he evaluates, but also because he
would rather not hear sad stories behind the selling of books.
</P>
<P>
   Although buyers pride themselves on their knowledge, a rare book
will sometimes be bought for far less than its value. Then buyers
try to find the seller and pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The same effort is made when something is left inside a book. A
scrapbook behind the buyers' counter contains the book leavings of
sellers who were never located. It is a sometimes hilarious,
sometimes bittersweet repository of lost memories.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook includes: a bowling clinic diploma, a karaoke
request form, the number for dial-a-prayer, a prom photo, a torn $5
bill, an 8-by-10 glossy of Oliver North, a photo of a nude man, a
photo of a Little League team, a photo of a nude woman, the
handwritten goals of a seventh grader.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook is hardly the only expression of quirky at
Powell's, a store that seems intent on elevating quirky to Olympian
heights.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Books frequently resounds with semi-intelligible
announcements over its loudspeakers. A support beam displays the
autographs of visiting science-fiction authors. A tiny poster in
the fiction section urges, ``Save a tree! Buy a used book!'' A
display of Powell's souvenirs looks to have been last dusted a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to what manager Sontz refers to as Powell's
``funk factor,'' one more cornerstone of its appeal to legions of
loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Copra is one such customer, a bearded bicycle mechanic in
overalls who could easily be the quintessential counterculture
Oregonian. The 51-year-old Portland man takes great pride in not
having owned a car since 1966 and has no computer either. He makes
his pilgrimmages to Powell's by bus and searches for gems by
favorite authors J.G. Ballard, Thomas Hardy and Christopher
Isherwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I might want, I'll find it at Powell's,'' Copra
emphasizes. ``A bookstore can never be too big _ there's just
something about bigness. And I don't want some bookstore guy in a
vest asking if he can help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's legion of loyal customers extends far beyond Oregon,
especially since the arrival of the Internet. Powell's has had a
Web site _ www.powells.com _ since 1993 and its business there has
grown markedly since 1996 when the store's entire inventory of 1
million-plus books was put online, requiring 13 months of tedious
work.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's no-nonsense Web site now generates annual revenues of
more than $3 million. A new building across the street will house
its burgeoning Internet operation. And Powell's inventory is so
huge that it often supplies the virtual business that bills itself
as ``Earth's Biggest Bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Amazon.com provides considerable revenue for
Powell's, which sends books to the Internet retailer's Seattle
distribution center for shipment under its own mailing label. Some
might see this as trading with the enemy, but not Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to build alliances that are mutually beneficial,'' he
explains. ``Amazon has so much marketing money behind them, which
we do not. Customers who want our books cheaper than (through)
Amazon, can buy direct from us. If people are avid readers, they'll
find us sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, a Portland native and now a member of the city's
establishment, brings the same matter-of-factness to the store's
high-profile activism. Powell's has been in the forefront of
support for the literary arts in Portland, the first business to
fund the Portland Arts &AMP; Lectures series (precursor to its Seattle
namesake), as well as aiding school libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual November promotion, Powell's donates 10 percent of
a sale when a customer mentions ``it's for the schools.'' That
raised $57,000 to purchase library books for Portland and Beaverton
schools in 1997 and $70,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even more visible has been Powell's contributions to defeat
Oregon initiatives to curtail gay rights or tighten obscenity laws.
The store's staff-developed mission and values statement includes
support for such causes, but Powell's goes far beyond mouthing
expected platitudes. It was the first Oregon business to oppose the
1992 anti-gay rights initiative, at risk of offending some
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who said they would never shop here again
and people who said they would never shop anywhere else, but I take
it all with a grain of salt,'' Powell says. ``I don't go looking
for these fights, but people come to me. I believe being a
bookseller carries a burden of supporting the First Amendment and
other causes, such as racial diversity and gay rights. Our
intelligent and active staff continues to challenge us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is making Powell's better. It may seem like
book nirvana to many customers, but those who work there know it
must continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things I'd like to change around here,''
stresses Sontz, 48, a shrewd businesswoman who started in the
remainder department and advanced through the ranks. ``How to be
larger and more customer-friendly _ that's my life story here.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell has his own ideas of what to improve. The store is open
daily from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., but he wonders if 14 hours is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer 8 a.m.,'' he states.
</P>
<P>
   Sontz responds in mock horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael sees 25 people out front when we open at 9 a.m., so he
thinks we should open at 8,'' she says. ``I've held him off on that
for a decade.''

HEARING THE VOICES OF WOMEN IN POVERTY

DON'T CALL US OUT OF NAME 
The Untold Lives of Women and Girls in Poor America 
By Lisa Dodson 
Beacon, 256 pp. $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've identified her _ or so you thought _ on buses, street
corners, and in shopping malls, pushing a stroller or fawning over
a macho boyfriend who fathers her child but will never marry her.
You imagine her to be a sassy, irresponsible young woman who is
either pregnant or soon will be, happily headed for the welfare
rolls, where she will dwell in luxury for generations while you
barely eke out a living.
</P>
<P>
   You might stare with disdain and think your hard-earned tax
dollars support her habits of drug use and sexual promiscuity and
feed a cycle of dependency. You might think you have her figured
out, but when you read the work of Lisa Dodson, it becomes clear
that the young woman you thought you knew was a figment of
somebody's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, little of what you may have heard about life for the
poor woman in urban America today is anything but mythology,
according to Dodson, a fellow at the Radcliffe Public Policy
Institute and author of ``Don't Call Us Out of Name: The Untold
Lives of Women and Girls in Poor America.''
</P>
<P>
   She critiques mounds of mostly male-generated scholarship that
demonized poor women for the supposed sloth that landed them in
their impoverished condition. Poverty is simply an outcome of
persistent laziness, those studies say. But Dodson's book _ a
collection of interviews and studies that illustrate enormous
hardships faced by countless teenagers, who awkwardly ascend into
womanhood with colossal burdens on their shoulders _ delivers
chilling accounts of lives lived on a slippery edge, which drops
off into danger. ``Against the challenge of primary knowledge,
critical insight and informed interpretations, an old stereotype
simply falls to pieces,'' Dodson writes, preparing the reader for
the revealing narratives that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson's book is a formidable deconstruction of the rhetoric
behind the widely believed myth that poor young women and girls
enjoy their plight as denizens of the nation's economic underbelly.
She allows the women and girls to show, sometimes in profane
vernacular, that they are less abusers of the system they find
themselves trying to navigate than the victims of its failings.
</P>
<P>
   She interviewed hundreds of young women of all races, most of
them in the Boston area. They give voice to a large segment of what
may be the single most talked-about group of this age, in which
states dismantle welfare systems in order to save the nation from
the ``criminal class'' of so-called welfare cheats. To Dodson, the
labels cast on these women are in error. She writes, ``The research
reveals tales of resistance by women who have learned how to stand
up to a society which does not know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many poor women can expect to be sexually abused: ``We always
know that there's guys out there going to try to jump on you,'' one
young woman said, almost nonchalantly. ``It's part of the world,
you know. It's just part of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a woman can also expect men in positions of authority to
perform services they are already paid to do _ such as drug
rehabilitation or building management _ as long as she is willing
to assume a variety of sexual positions, a phenomenon Dodson has
termed ``abuse of the regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in poverty is fair game for anyone, and few will
protect her. She can count on her boyfriend hitting her in front of
other people: ``Public face, it seems, is considered to be the key
component in young men's pride,'' Dodson says.
</P>
<P>
   She can also look forward to a life of Sisyphean sacrifice and
unpaid labor. Most of the young women recalled having to labor at
home between 16 and 20 hours each week doing chores and caring for
siblings while their brothers sought an elusive manhood in city
streets. And such women were also expected to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   She can surely expect a lifelong stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson's vigorous attack on uninformed punditry, her ardent
defense of women who struggle against the odds, is intended to
catch the attention of policymakers and to elicit their
understanding. She calls welfare law revisions, such as the one in
Massachusetts, ``take-no-prisoners'' policies, and she asks that
the users of the system, the women, be heard before laws are
drafted. She believes they must be allowed to represent themselves,
a time-honored idea that one hopes still has resonance in American
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who will live with the policy consequences must be
at the table,'' she writes. ``And they must be there from the
beginning, not brought in for the photographers after all the
decisions are made.''

<P>
   Forget about my New Year's resolutions, let's talk about what
you can do in 1999 to improve the quality of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not you specifically. You're a smart and sensible person,
anyone can see that. That you're reading this very newspaper shows
you to be an individual of taste and class. Congratulations on
being a quality individual.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other guy we have to worry about. The other gal too.
They're the ones who don't know how to behave in public; they're
the ones who annoy us with their rude, stupid, ignorant,
thoughtless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As the always-pixiesh and ever-delightful Meg Ryan once told me
after we had fun mocking some other people, ``They're all so flawed
and we're so perfect!'' (All right, all right _ I resolve in 1999
to hold the gratuitous celebrity name-dropping to three per month.
Well, four.)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it's still the holiday season, so let's give the oafs a
break, OK? Let's assume they know not what they do, and they're
just in need of a little guidance, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll come up with a list of words and deeds that constitute
unacceptable behavior, and you can clip the column and quietly slip
it to someone who will appreciate being set straight.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few questions that should never be asked of anyone _ not your
best friend, not your sister, not your children:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you put on weight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So how much are you making these days?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you guys going to get married?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you guys going to have a baby?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, did you ever sleep with her (him, it)?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you rent, why don't you buy a place?''
</P>
<P>
   And why is it that you should never ask these questions? BECAUSE
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the baby question. Maybe someone has a medical
problem that precludes a pregnancy; perhaps one partner in the
relationship wants children and the other doesn't. It could be that
the couple's been trying to have a child for three years, with no
success; there might be a miscarriage or two you don't know about.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer is, it's between the two of them.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, if you see someone from your distant past, it's
really bad form to walk up say, ``You don't remember me, do you?''
It puts the other person on the defensive and makes for an awkward
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever someone says, ``You don't remember me, do you?'' I
reply, ``Of course I do, and I'm wondering why you're not obeying
the restraining order.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About that gum-cracking: Unless you're playing shortstop for a
Little League team, it makes you look and sound like a surprise
guest on the ``Springer'' show, OK?
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a long line behind you at the cashier, who is ringing up
$147 in merchandise. Hint: Now is a good time to reach into the big
bottomless purse and fish out the checkbook or the credit card or
the little zippered pouch where you keep your cash tucked away.
Don't wait until the items are bagged to start digging around for
your method of payment! It's not as if you should be taken by
surprise when they ask you to actually pay for the items.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're waiting for an elevator. When the doors open, should you:
</P>
<P>
   A. Bullrush right in, thus creating a human traffic jam with
those who are trying to exit the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   B. Stand back and wait for the elevator to empty before
entering.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered B., excellent. Your brain is indeed functioning.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of mechanized transportation, the top of the escalator
is not _ repeat, IS NOT _ a good place to stand while you consider
your next move.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See those people up there on the big silver screen? They're
called actors, and they've been paid a lot of money to recite
dialogue written by professional wordsmiths. Trust me: What you've
got to say is not more interesting to me than what they've got to
say, even if it's a Joe Pesci comedy. So really, shut up.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so you enjoy whistling loudly at work, eh? That's great,
because you'll never have to wonder if people are calling you a
rude simpleton behind your back. They are!
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others dream of a 1999 where nations can live in harmony, and
the little children of the world always have food to eat and a roof
over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   I'd settle for a place where those who engage in the above
activities would give it a rest.

LAWYER, RESIDENTS SEE TRUTH IN FILM'S PORTRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f cocoding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get a few facts straight about the new movie, ``A Civil
Action.'' Jan Schlichtmann's Porsche was not as cool-looking as the
one in the movie, and his office was on Broad Street, not tony
Charles Street at the foot of Beacon Hill. He doesn't look like
John Travolta, either.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlichtmann, the flamboyant lawyer portrayed by Travolta
who battled two major corporations over their role in poisoning
wells in Woburn, believes that ``A Civil Action'' is true on a
deeper level. It captures both the warlike atmosphere of his
lawsuit and the futility of counting on courts to provide justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments in the film . . . in which I felt the
emotions of that time,'' said Schlichtmann, who spent his law firm
into bankruptcy hoping for a big verdict against Beatrice Foods and
W. R. Grace &AMP; Co. ``I found myself really convulsed by the humor
and the irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action,'' which has its local premiere at Boston's
Wang Theatre on Jan. 6, tells the story of the bitter 1986 lawsuit
over the leukemia deaths of five children and one adult that family
members believed were caused by chemicals from Grace and Beatrice.
Far from winning a big verdict, Schlichtmann finally settled for $8
million from Grace and no admission of guilt by either firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Steven Zaillian, who won an Oscar for his
screenplay of ``Schindler's List,'' the moviemakers were concerned
with making a fair and realistic movie, bringing lawyers for both
sides to the set for advice and asking a federal lawyer for old
photos of her office to help recreate the mid-1980s offices of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann is particularly impressed with how realistic the
characters seem. Travolta plays him as a luxury-loving, obsessed
attorney whose singlemindedness makes the lawsuit possible but then
undermines efforts to win a favorable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And Schlichtmann doesn't disagree with the portrayal. ``Woburn
long ago put me in a position to be examined by many people from
many different angles. I'm used to it,'' he said. ``What I'm
impressed by is the integrity of the retelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Civil Action,'' based on the best-selling book of the
same name, is most concerned with the lawyers, employing the
environmental disaster as a backdrop against which Travolta and
Robert Duvall, as Beatrice's attorney Jerome Facher, fight their
legal grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nonlawyers _ the parents of the dead children,
neighborhood activists, and even the well-meaning government
regulators _ have a limited role, although their collective
efforts, spread over years and hundreds of meetings, finally
cleaned up Woburn's water.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Robbins, who initiated the Woburn lawsuit after her
9-year-old son died of leukemia, isn't even represented in the
movie, and one poignant line is spoken by another parent, Anne
Anderson, played by Kathleen Quinlan. In real life, Robbins had
said she would sit in the left-hand corner of the courtroom,
because as he lay dying her son promised to meet her in the
left-hand corner of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset when I saw it coming out of her mouth. . . . It
feels like they really stole part of my life away,'' said Robbins,
who, like many former plaintiffs who attended a private screening
last week, felt the movie was too short.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also simplifies a complicated pollution history to
keep the focus on Beatrice and Grace. In reality, the wells on the
Aberjona River were surrounded by industries that likely
contributed to the 56 chemicals found in the wells, which Woburn's
engineers cautioned against digging in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woburn is really the beginning of our industrial history. It
embodies the mistakes of individuals and government agencies and
industries, who, for many years, behaved very irresponsibly,'' said
Gretchen Latowsky, former director of For A Cleaner Environment,
which watchdogged the Woburn cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann says that the movie underscores one of the most
important lessons he learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was perpetuating the very evil that I was railing against,''
he said, looking back on the more than $10 million the adversaries
spent in legal combat. ``When we fight with each other over the
truth, we do not honor the truth.''

MOVIE BRINGS TOXIC TRAGEDY   BACK TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WOBURN, Mass. _ Employees jokingly called the ditch behind the
W. R. Grace plant the ``swimming pool,'' though only a fool would
swim there. Until the early 1970s, workers dumped cleaning
solvents, paint, and other wastes into or near the ditch, never
imagining that the poisons might reach public water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   That carelessness cast W. R. Grace &AMP; Co. as a villain in one of
the most famous environmental trials in US history, pitting its
high-priced attorneys against parents who believed that their
children had been killed by Grace chemicals in their tap water. To
this day, the company denies that it poisoned Woburn wells, but it
paid the parents and their lawyers $8 million to end the legal
ordeal in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like a recurring nightmare, a new movie, ``A Civil
Action,'' reintroduces America to a history that Grace officials
have been trying to live down. The film, starring John Travolta as
the driven lawyer representing the Woburn parents, opened in New
York City on Christmas, accompanied by the advance publicity and
critical praise that may foreshadow a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie omits Grace's much-improved environmental
record since 1986, ``A Civil Action'' offers a powerful lens
through which to view how the environmental movement has
transformed American industry since the 1980s. Grace pollutes far
less than it once did, but, like many companies, it is still
haunted by the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think that they are very guilty and responsible for
everything that happened, even though Grace is trying to say they
didn't do it,'' said Woburn plaintiff Donna Robbins, whose
9-year-old son, Carl Robbins III, died of leukemia in 1981. ``I
don't know how they can go around saying they weren't
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Woburn case was never clear-cut, which is why only
a risk-taking lawyer like Travolta's character, Jan Schlichtmann,
would handle the parents' costly lawsuit, driving his law firm into
bankruptcy in the process. Grace's stainless-steel equipment plant
was just one of many industries huddled around wells G and H, the
farthest away of five companies that the US Environmental
Protection Agency later held legally responsible for cleaning up
the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Schlichtmann does not believe that Grace's chemical dumping
was remarkable for industry in the years before states and the
federal government passed tough laws on hazardous waste disposal.
In fact, some of the discharges may have been legal at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more the rule than the exception, in the sense that
they had a lot of things in their past that were ugly. There were
many companies that suffer from the same kind of an ugly past,''
Schlichtmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike other companies near wells G and H, Grace, along
with Beatrice Foods, had ``deep pockets,'' making it a good target
for a lawsuit aimed at recovering large amounts of money. Adding to
Grace's troubles, a conscience-stricken employee revealed the
company's secret dumping practices during preparation for the
trial, indirectly leading to a $10,000 criminal fine against Grace
by the Environmental Protection Agency. In the end, the jury let
Beatrice off, but found that Grace had contributed to the
contamination of the two wells.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Woburn case cemented Grace's image as one of
the nation's top polluters, along with Monsanto of Times Beach,
Mo., and Hooker Chemical of Love Canal in New York. In
Massachusetts alone, Grace was called to account for several other
environmental messes, from toxic chemical lagoons in Cambridge to
the plants in Acton that contaminated 40 percent of the town's
water supply. Meanwhile, thousands of people nationwide were
joining lawsuits charging that asbestos-containing insulation made
by Grace had made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continually do things that once again reinforce the
notion . . . that at times the chemical industry is callous and
acts with disregard for communities,'' Boston University management
professor John Mahon said in describing Grace to the Boston Herald
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   W. R. Grace officials insist they were never as bad as they
seemed to be; for instance, they were the first company around the
wells to test the ground water for contamination. But company
officials admit that they made serious errors in Woburn that turned
the community and government agencies against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes in addressing the concerns of the community
and government agencies, and we realized that it was up to us to
demonstrate our commitment to addressing these concerns,'' said
Mark Stoler, Grace's director of environment, health, and safety
and a junior lawyer for the company at the time of the Woburn
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, W. R. Grace, based in Boca Raton, Fla., barely resembles
the ``mega-corporation'' that Schlichtmann battles in ``A Civil
Action.'' Once a far-flung conglomerate with businesses ranging
from restaurants to pipelines to cruise ships, the empire built by
J. Peter Grace ran into falling profits in the 1980s, prompting
managers to sell off or close three-quarters of the firm's
businesses, leaving a company focused on specialty chemicals such
as cement additives and can sealants.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Grace's employment has plummeted, from 3,000
at the time of the Woburn suit to 538, as the controversial plant
on Washington Street in Woburn closed and the company facilities in
Acton were bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has shrunk in other important ways, as well, reducing its
toxic chemical releases by two-thirds from 1991 to 1995, according
to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, while slashing by
three-quarters both the environmental fines it must pay and its
overall waste generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington,
D.C.-based organization that evaluates corporations for socially
conscious investors, now ranks W. R. Grace as tops among US
specialty chemical companies for following environmental laws. Dan
Kennedy, a reporter for the weekly Boston Phoenix who covered the
trial for the Woburn Daily Times, described Grace as ``one of
Woburn's model corporate citizens'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to ``model corporate citizen'' has been neither
smooth nor easy, reflecting a company caught in a riptide of
changing standards. Grace had never faced an environmental lawsuit
before the Woburn case, despite decades of polluting activities,
such as chemical disposal, mining, radioactive contamination, and
asbestos manufacturing. Until 1987, Grace didn't even have a chief
environmental official.
</P>
<P>
   When the company finally created an Office of Environmental
Policy, they brought in a man to run it who was contemptuous of the
EPA. ``If the FAA were like the EPA, all the planes would crash,''
Hugh L. Carey, hired as Grace's environment director in 1987, told
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Grace has been named a responsible party at 32 Superfund
hazardous waste cleanups across the country, from Woburn to
Lansing, Mich., where the company is part of a cleanup of an old
manufacturing waste pit.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost twice the specialty chemical industry average,
according to the IRRC, and Grace has spent $126 million to clean up
old environmental hazards since 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Grace has paid half a billion dollars to settle
lawsuits over its asbestos-containing insulation, and by the end of
1997 the company faced 96,000 claims of bodily injury from the
insulation, which Grace stopped selling in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Stoler argues that the high number of waste sites partly
reflects the buying and selling of subsidiaries during Grace's
conglomerate years, which made the company owner of waste sites
that it never contaminated. For example, Grace has spent more than
$1 million investigating possible jet-fuel leaks at the
Massachusetts Military Reservation from a pipeline the company
briefly owned after it had already been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Grace's record also reflects decades of sloppy
waste-handling practices, some of which are just coming to light
today. For example, Grace is only now conducting a full search for
asbestos at its Cambridge property and an abutting playing field,
up to 80 years after the contamination began. In New Jersey,
meanwhile, Grace has agreed to resume cleanup of radioactive waste
at a site the company had believed was cleaned up more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And other messes are the subject of dispute. John Morgan of
Winchester has sued Grace, as well as three trucking companies, for
what he says is toxic waste dumping in front of his Rock Avenue
house in 1982, a charge the company vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, activists and government officials who have worked with
Grace at waste sites over the years say they have detected a
profound shift in company attitudes, from defensive and difficult
in the 1980s to helpful and even forward-looking today.
</P>
<P>
   In Acton, where nine Grace waste lagoons and two landfills had
contaminated public wells and the company dragged its feet on the
cleanup for years, the company finally apologized for its conduct
in 1989 and took a more aggressive approach to cleanup in the early
1990s. Activists say the change reflected the intervention of top
Grace environmental officials, eager to speed the cleanup process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished more in three years than we had in the
previous 12,'' said Edmond Benoit, who supervised the Acton cleanup
for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   In Woburn, Grace went from mounting a $7 million legal defense
against the Woburn parents' lawsuit to installing a water treatment
system that was more effective and more costly than the EPA
required.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers say the changes reflect the fact the
sprawling corporation is slowly getting the message that
environmental protection is important, particularly when the highly
regarded Stoler took charge of the firm's environmental affairs in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, as long as Grace is cleaning up its past, some people still
feel at risk. Russ Bromfield of Cambridge, who lives near the area
Grace is studying for asbestos contamination, has been unimpressed
with company efforts to show sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view them more as the enemy,'' Bromfield said. ``They
haven't done anything to show me they have positive intentions in
the neighborhood.''

SOX' TV DEAL CAN ONLY BE SCRAMBLED BY INCLUSION OF DUNN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is ever simple with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Since last season ended: They lost their best player. They
raised ticket prices. They evicted sidewalk vendors, only to
reinstate them after a push by the local government.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what else the Red Sox brass can do before the
end of the year to annoy their long-suffering fans.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, you guessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Screw up their television deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six months, the Red Sox have negotiated with two
media heavyweights, Fox Sports and Barry Diller's USA Network. They
talked with Channel 68, the station that carried the team's
over-the-air games the last three seasons. They even talked with
Kevin Dunn, who doesn't have any money or his own television
station.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who is close to signing a deal?
</P>
<P>
   If you picked Dunn, consider yourself Red Sox executive
material.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and his partner, former CBS president Gene Jankowski,
offered the Red Sox $10.1 million to air 75 games next season.
Because the two don't have their own station, they apparently
reached an agreement with Channel 56 to carry the games in Boston
and are trying to secure similar deals in other large New England
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're going to get the deal done,'' Channel 56
general manager Leslie Glenn proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   That was last week, and Glenn predicted that things would be
finalized Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't, and more than likely, they won't be, largely
because of one big reason: money. Dunn and Jankowski don't have
enough, and most potential backers are reluctant to make up the
difference because of an even bigger reason: The Red Sox are a
losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a good, hard look at the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunn deal comes out to about $135,000 per game. Add another
$25,000 for production and the cost is $160,000. Each game has
about 60 30-second advertising spots. Channel 56 gets 10-12 of
them. That leaves Dunn with, say, 50 spots to break even or make
money. To do that, he must get at least $3,200 per spot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem. Channel 68 had a hard time getting $2,000
for a spot. On New England Sports Network, the premium cable
channel, owned in part by the Red Sox, that carries the other half
of the team's schedule, ad spots sell for about $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   It's not impossible to jack up the price, but it's pretty tough,
especially considering the number of media outlets selling time
during Red Sox games and the demographics of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, NESN, Channel 68, and, to a limited extent, Fox
(eight games) sent sales forces to the Boston marketplace to place
ads. If Dunn's deal goes through, that would add his sales force,
plus the one at Channel 56.
</P>
<P>
   With that level of competition, the price goes down, not up.
Further eroding the value of advertising spots is the demographic
of the Red Sox audience, which tends to be older. That is not
necessarily a bad thing, but advertisers prefer 18- to 49-year-old
males, not the 50-plus crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 68, for instance, had great ratings last season and
still lost millions. And the team made the playoffs and actually
won a game.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that Dunn and Jankowski are extremely smooth
talkers and are able to get $2,500 per 30-second spot. That would
mean $125,000 per game, which would put them $35,000 in the hole
per game. Multiply that by 75, and that hole is now $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Financial backers are not usually generous sorts, especially
when the borrower factors lottery winnings into the repayment plan.
The money men are probably using a more realistic number for the
30-second spots, something like $1,800. That would leave Dunn and
Jankowski $70,000 in the hole after each game, and a staggering
$5.2 million in debt at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox apparently don't care what happens to Dunn and
Jankowski. Or whether such media hotbeds as Manchester, N.H., or
Portland, Maine, can make up the difference between the rights fee
and the shortage of Boston advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox CEO John Harrington knows the numbers. He knows the
television rights for the ne'er-do-well team are worth about $8.5
million a year, $9 million tops. Can't blame the man for trying to
squeeze every penny that he can.
</P>
<P>
   Securing advertising is not the Red Sox' problem. They want that
$10.1 million. Or at least a guaranteed letter of credit, which so
far hasn't come.
</P>
<P>
   They really wanted $14 million per year. Channel 68 had the
chance to renew its contract for that amount but declined.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about forgetting history. Three years ago, the Red
Sox had another deal on the table. It was worth about $14 million a
year. At the last minute, the deal fell through. Dunn was heading
that deal, too, and, three years later, he still doesn't have
enough money.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CHARLES KURALT'S AMERICAN MOMENTS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Peter Freundlich (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $22)
</P>
<P>
   ``Moments'' is the right word. That's all we get here _ they
come close to being sound bytes, and that was never Kuralt's style.
These were the last projects he worked on before he died, and he
was uncomfortable with them. The proposal was that he would create
90-second moments to be distributed to independent television
stations. At first he refused, saying 90 seconds wasn't enough time
to do anything worthwhile. Writer-producer Freundlich persuaded him
to try. All 117 of the pieces that they wrote and produced are
included here, in a book of 255 pages. Kuralt visits a kazoo
factory, a flagmaker, a basket weaver, a shoemaker, a man who
carves whirligigs, the caretaker for the Statue of Liberty (here
Kuralt was beaten soundly by David Isay, who profiled the same man,
Charlie DeLeo, for National Public Radio and published a wonderful
essay about him in his book, ``Holding On''). It helps if you
imagine Kuralt's voice reading these little pieces, but it's not
enough to make them seem substantive. They are too brief, too
prescribed, and they'll make you miss what Kuralt was in his good
days. With a foreword by Charles Osgood. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; EX LIBRIS: CONFESSIONS OF A COMMON READER &QL; 
 &UR; Anne Fadiman (FSG, $16)
</P>
<P>
   When Anne Fadiman and her husband finally got around to
consolidating their libraries (they had lived together for six
years and had been married for five, but her books had remained at
the northern end of their loft, his at the southern), they engaged
in negotiations that in seriousness and tenacity resembled the
Mideast peace talks. He was a ``lumper,'' whose books were
unorganized and charmingly kept, some vertical, some horizontal,
some actually (begin itals) behind (end itals)others. Fadiman kept
her books ``balkanized by nationality and subject matter'' and
proposed that in their consolidation they arrange English
literature chronologically but American literature alphabetically
by author (their American collection was mostly 20th century, and
``chronological distinctions would require Talmudic
hairsplitting''). That she spends eight pages talking about the
details of this literary conversion is a measure of how
self-conscious she is when it comes to her reading habits. Hardly
the common reader described by Virginia Woolf, Fadiman is beguiled
by the physical presence of books, the feel of them, the memory of
them, the milestones they are in our lives. She also loves her part
in it, the (begin itals) show (end itals) of reading. Is she being
pretentious when she tells us that she once left a book store with
19 pounds of books, and that she knows this because she weighed
them when she got home? It doesn't matter. These essays (first
published in ``Civilization'' magazine) are self-absorbed, but
dumbfoundingly readable. If you're zealous about books, give them a
try. All you'll want is equal time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST &QL; 
 &UR; Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $45)
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was a good idea. Garner pairs text and photographs of
some of the momentous events of this century with two CDs that
bring you radio and television announcements of each. The audio
footage is tremendously effective, as when back-to-back we hear an
early, sketchy announcement that President Kennedy has been shot, a
later report that the bullet struck him in the head and, finally,
an emotional Walter Cronkite's announcement that Kennedy has died.
We also hear Lyndon Johnson decline a re-election bid, Robert
Kennedy's last words to a reporter before he was shot, the gunfire
that killed four students at Kent State University, Richard Nixon
resigning the presidency, the announcement of John Lennon's death,
the riots that followed the Rodney King verdict, a bomb exploding
in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
the first reports of Princess Diana's death and other chilling
moments that many of us remember all too well. Each is preceded by
a tedious, overly dramatic narration by television newsman Bill
Kurtis that almost sours the whole package. Are the broadcasts
worth waiting through the unnecessary buildup? Yes. Cronkite
contributes a foreword to the text. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME: MY STORY &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Jordan (Crown, $50)
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Phoenix and Charles Barkley in the 1993 finals was
like playing against your little brother and knowing you're
well-equipped. Your little brother might beat you one or two out of
seven, but you know he's going to get beat in the end. The Suns
didn't know how to win. They knew how to compete, but they didn't
know how to win. There is a difference.'' You have just read one of
the few passages in this book that does not contain the word ``I.''
Most paragraphs _ and they're not long paragraphs _ are riddled
with it. Even if you are starved for basketball, even if the ``I''
in question is the greatest player of all time, it wears on you
after a while. The text in this Michaelfest is accompanied by
countless photographs of Jordan in all of his evolutionary stages:
Michael with hair, Michael in a succession of Nikes, Michael in
silhouette, in a suit, in Bill Cartwright's face. And later,
Michael in his mansion, in his baseball uniform, in the grips of
the flu during the 1997 finals. Sound like your thing? We'll say
only one thing more: Not once is he as pretty on paper as he is
moving through the air. &QL;

FANNY TROLLOPE 
The Life and Adventures of a Clever Woman 
By Pamela Neville-Sington 
Viking,. 416 pp., $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Trollope's publishers deliberately omitted his first
name from the cover of his first novel, hoping buyers would assume
the book had been written by his best-selling mother, Fanny. A
century and a half later, we still read the works of Anthony
Trollope, one of the great novelists of the Victorian era _ but who
remembers Fanny?
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Neville-Sington's ``Fanny Trollope: The Life and
Adventures of a Clever Woman'' is a lively biography of an
extraordinary woman, a writer who deserves to be remembered in her
own right and not just as Anthony's mother. Her life was as
eventful and dramatic as any of her 35 novels or six travel books.
Neville-Sington's meticulously researched biography tells Fanny's
story with the energy, humor, and joie de vivre that characterized
her subject's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny Milton was born into the social milieu Jane Austen
immortalized in her novels. She was four years younger than Austen;
their fathers were rectors in the same Hampshire deanery. Fanny was
educated at home and encouraged to read widely, the classics as
well as popular novels of the day (``It is good for us to read
trash occasionally,'' she wrote late in life).
</P>
<P>
   At 30, she married the senior Anthony Trollope, an
Oxford-educated barrister, a difficult man who probably suffered
from emotional or mental illness. The marriage was tolerable, at
first. But he was hopelessly inept at managing money, and they were
always in financial difficulties. After the death from tuberculosis
of their 11-year old son, Arthur, in 1824, his anger increased, his
dark moods worsened. Fanny mourned her son deeply and withdrew. The
marriage began to come apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1827, Fanny took an extraordinary step for a woman of her
class in the Victorian era: She set off for America with three of
her five remaining children, Henry, 16, Cecilia, 11, and Emily, 9.
Tom, 17, and Anthony, 12, were left behind to finish their
educations. Her reasons for leaving England were partly financial:
The Trollopes were deeply in debt. The journey also offered her the
opportunity to live apart from her increasingly bad-tempered
husband without the social stigma of a formal separation. She also
had fallen under the spell of the charismatic social reformer
Frances Wright, who had established in the backwoods of Tennessee a
community called Nashoba to educate slaves in preparation for their
eventual emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   The journey was difficult, Nashoba was a complete failure,
Frances Wright turned out to be a crank. Fanny and the children
settled in Cincinnati, where she hatched one money-making scheme
after another. Cincinnati, nicknamed ``Porkopolis'' because of the
number of pigs who met their end in local slaughterhouses, was a
booming community, the fastest-growing city in America at the time.
Its citizens were avid for culture, which Fanny tried to provide by
producing amateur theatricals and establishing a wax museum, among
other ventures. Unfortunately, her most ambitious project, a lavish
and eccentric social/ &QC; 
entertainment center called the Cincinnati Bazaar, was a disaster.
Fanny begged and borrowed money to return to England.
</P>
<P>
   At age 53, bankrupt, desperate to support her family, Fanny
launched a writing career. Her first book, ``Domestic Manners of
the Americans,'' a gossipy, critical, humorous account of her
travels, was an immediate sensation on both sides of the Atlantic,
though not for the same reason. British readers relished Fanny's
portrait of their boorish, benighted, bigoted American cousins.
American readers wanted to hang her, but they bought her book, and
they talked and argued about it, and about her, for years.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny went from success to success, writing novels, romances,
travel books. Misfortune dogged her personal life. Three more of
her children succumbed to tuberculosis. Only Anthony and Tom
survived her. Four of her grandchildren died of the same disease.
Her husband's disposition worsened. She found a refuge in her work;
for 24 years her writing pace never flagged. She began working at
4:30 every morning, so she could be done with her day's writing
before the rest of her family awoke. She was 77 when her last book,
``Fashionable Life; or Paris and London'' was published, in 1856.
She died at 83.
</P>
<P>
   Neville-Sington took her subtitle from one of Fanny's later
novels, ``The Life and Adventures of a Clever Woman,'' but the word
``clever'' barely begins to descibe her subject. Fanny emerges from
these pages as amazingly resourceful, tough, courageous, ambitious,
good-hearted, good-humored, loving, likable, wonderful company. She
never cared for fashion; her manners were sometimes rough. Her
independent spirit was far from the Victorian ideal of womanhood.
She was a woman ahead of her time, in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her books were meant to amuse, but she also tackled
controversial subjects. She wrote the first anti-slavery novel,
``The Life and Adventures of Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw'' (1836),
as well as a novel about the wretched lives of England's working
poor, ``The Life and Adventures of Michael Armstrong, the Factory
Boy'' (1840).
</P>
<P>
   Fanny made no apologies for writing for the masses. Some critics
sniffed at her books and called them vulgar, but she was popular
with readers. Neville-Sington notes numerous similarities between
Fanny's work and that of her son. Each possessed a lively wit and a
keen eye for human foibles. They mined the same literary ground,
and many of the same experiences. Neville-Sington's research
reveals that the son freely borrowed characters and plots from the
mother, though he never acknowledged it.
</P>
<P>
   Neville-Sington believes Anthony Trollope was to blame, in part
at least, for the decline of his mother's popularity as an author.
In his own ``An Autobiography'' _ published in 1883, 20 years after
his mother's death _ Trollope condemned her novels in harsh, almost
spiteful terms. Neville-Sington writes, ``Mrs. Trollope's novels
suddenly ceased to be published. Anthony had, in effect, buried his
mother's literary reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's resentment of his mother is probably understandable,
for a number of reasons. Neville-Sington suggests that he may never
have gotten over his anger and disappointment at being left behind
when Fanny traveled to America. He also complained that she didn't
encourage him in his writing, though Neville-Sington presents
evidence to the contrary. But perhaps no amount of maternal
encouragement could have satisfied the shy, insecure Anthony.
Neville-Sington speculates that the main reason behind his
mean-spirited treatment of her may have been her reputation as a
``coarse'' and ``vulgar'' writer of popular fiction. Anthony
aspired to, and achieved, greater things. He may have wanted to
distance himself from her.
</P>
<P>
   Neville-Sington writes that without his mother's example and
support, Anthony might never have been able to launch his literary
career in the first place. She believes he paid tribute to her in
his own way: ``Although in his memoirs Anthony could not bring
himself to be as generous to his mother as perhaps he ought to have
been, he honors her with the innumerable strong-willed and
brave-hearted women who appear in his fiction. I like to think that
one of Anthony's best-loved creations, Glencora Palliser, is a
conscious and deliberate portrait of his mother.''

nearly two-thirds of the voters are white. Many black politicians
have managed to attract white support in urban, New South areas
like Atlanta. But Bishop's electoral success demonstrates that even

   SMALL-CARS (Undated) _ Gasoline prices have plunged and sales of
sport utility vehicles are soaring, yet many of the world's biggest
auto makers have made the seemingly unconventional decision to
introduce new models of small cars in the United States in the
coming months. The interest in small cars reflects a shift in how
auto makers look at small cars. Disappearing are the economy boxes.
In their place will be more expensive models that look and perform
like short versions of mid-size cars. The new small cars will also

CREATING COLETTE 
Volume I: From Ingenue to Libertine, 1873-1913 
By Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier 
Steerforth Press, 367 pp., illustrated, $32 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of her exuberant life, the writer the world would
come to celebrate as Colette once remarked, ``They have of me an
old stereotype image.'' Were such words uttered by anyone else, the
comment could be regarded as the lament of someone branded by a
youthful indiscretion or a rueful reflection on a stubborn
impression that forever obscured the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But coming from the woman born Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, it is
hard to imagine her making such a statement without a sly, telling
twinkle in her eye. Whatever perception the public holds of the
famed French writer is an image carefully cultivated and crafted by
Colette herself. By the time of her death at age 81 in 1954,
Colette was more icon than woman, swaddled in grand myth and
naughty innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   And she probably wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Hers was
a life lived full, a great hungry thing greedy to experience
everything the world had to offer. A renaissance woman, she made
her name as a writer of such novels as ``Gigi,'' later made into a
1958 musical starring Leslie Caron, Maurice Chevalier, and his
signature song, ``Thank Heaven for Little Girls.'' Her ``Claudine''
novels sparked a social revolution that redefined attitudes and
social expression. But she is perhaps best remembered for her
myriad love affairs with both men and women, and her free-thinking,
convention-be-damned style that made Paris burn. A woman who all
but created the jet-set lifestyle of mad parties and holy
indulgence, Colette was what Madonna thinks she is.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder then that such a life could not be contained
within a single book. ``Creating Colette: From Ingenue to
Libertine, 1973-1913,'' details the first 40 years of Colette's
life, and if this first volume is any indication, this may well
become the definitive biography of the woman who seemed to live a
life-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier have also tackled
biographies of Simone de Beauvoir and Marcel Proust. But they have
met their greatest challenge in Colette, and perform a masterful
job of sifting through the myths and deconstructing the fictions,
many of which Colette perpetuated. Conversely, they also give
credence to some of her claims, especially regarding her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her life, and in fact even in death, many have
dismissed Colette's contention that she had black Caribbean
ancestors. Some have accused the nonbelievers of racism, but given
Colette's ability to spin colorful tales of half-truths, it is more
likely that some simply took anything she said with a grain of
salt. As the authors write, ``A genius at self-promotion, Colette
had become the mythical figure she and a collective act of faith
had created.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was merit in her assertions of mixed heritage. Francis
and Gontier trace Colette's lineage to 1792, and her
great-grandfather Robert Landois, a wealthy mulatto from
Martinique. There is also a four-page appendix dealing solely with
Landois, and how documentation of Colette's heritage became
obscured. Even more attention is paid to Colette's mother, Adele
Eugenie Sidonie ``Sido'' Landois, who shaped her daughter's liberal
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Colette was born Jan. 28, 1873, and for someone who so enjoyed
the world, she took her own sweet time coming into it. Sido was in
labor for three days, and her daughter was born ``all blue and
silent.'' According to Colette, it was ``my own self-determination
and sheer will which started my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sido and her husband, Captain Jules-Joseph Colette, a war hero
who lost a leg fighting with Napoleon, imbued their daughter with
an early appreciation of the finer things; she was barely 3 the
first time she tasted wine. She would later write: ``Daintily, I
drained the best of my father's cellar goblet by goblet.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Colette married her first husband, Henry
Gauthier-Villars, a writer who would both help and hinder her
literary aspirations, she was already immersed in a life of free
love and sexual experimentation. She thought of herself as
``unisexual,'' and possesser of ``the extraordinary soul of an
intelligent man and of a passionate woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis and Gontier take great pains to highlight Colette's
reputation as a writer who excelled as an essayist as well as a
novelist. It is valid to do so since, in 1954, Colette became the
first female French writer awarded a state funeral. But it is the
life of the woman _ unbridled, risk-taking, and liberated _ that
resonates and provides a delicious, vicarious thrill for us in
these far more cautious, conservative times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colette not only wrote but openly lived according to her
beliefs,'' her biograpers write. `` . . . Colette, for 81 years,
six months, and six days, feasted on life.''

LOSING A FRIEND, GAINING PERSPECTIVE

THE EVOLUTION OF JANE 
By Cathleen Schine 
Houghton Mifflin, 210 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Cathleen Schine's perceptive comedy of manners,
``The Evolution of Jane,'' might lead one to expect the central
character to undergo a profound change over the course of the
story. The evolution Jane experiences is a subtle one, a slight but
crucial mutation, as understated as Schine's style.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Jane Barlow is a self-obsessed young woman, recently
divorced, who sets off to tour the Galapagos Islands. The trip is
her mother's idea. She thinks Jane needs to ``go abroad'' in order
to heal. Jane doesn't feel wounded by her divorce. She's happier
without her husband. What's really eating at Jane is the loss of
her best friend, her cousin Martha. Jane has spent 10 years
mourning the dissolution of their friendship, wondering what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever lost a friend?'' the novel begins. ``It is the
saddest and most baffling experience. No one sympathizes, unless
the friend dies, which she did not. I lost my best friend many
years ago. She had been my best friend for a decade, for more than
half my childhood, and then she evaporated, as though she had never
really existed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Off Jane goes to the Galapagos, a destination she's dreamed of
visiting since girlhood, when her fascination with Charles Darwin
began: ``Whenever I hear his name, to this day, I experience a
sudden alertness, as if my own name has been spoken.'' Jane muses
on the concept of species. What is a species? Who decides? Why are
some species more successful than others?
</P>
<P>
   Like the central characters in Schine's previous books,
``Rameau's Niece'' and ``The Love Letter,'' Jane probes the Big
Philosophical Questions and complains (some might say whines) about
life's problems. Schine's heroines are all-too-human, self-doubting
and self-deluding, and sympathetic. We can laugh at them, and at
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane arrives in Baltra, one of the Galapagos Islands, she
finds Martha holding a sign with the name of her tour group. Now a
naturalist, Martha has a job with the Ecuadorian parks service,
leading tours. She will be Jane's ``Galapagos hostess.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha is friendly to Jane, but doesn't want to talk about their
past. Jane trails around after Martha, drinking in her knowledge of
Galapagos flora and fauna, all the while wondering what happened
between them to sever their friendship. They had been more than
friends, more than cousins, more like twins, so close they seemed
to be two halves of a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ask Martha . . . why she stopped being my friend.
I wanted to ask her if she would be my friend again. Of course I
could do neither. One has one's pride. Anyway, how could she
explain the end of something that itself had no explanation? `What
is the evolutionary reason for friendship?' I said to her. `Good
 &UR; morning &LR;  to you too, Jane,' she said, laughing. `And evolution
doesn't have reasons. It's opportunistic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jane, in her obsessive way, recalls the details of their
friendship, searching for clues, for possible offenses on her part
that might explain Martha's disappearance from her life. She mulls
over their family history, examining a mysterious feud between
Martha's parents and her own. What was it about? Could it explain
Martha's rejection of her?
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's transcendent ideas about evolutionary change are
everywhere in ``The Evolution of Jane.'' Jane tries to use
Darwinian concepts to explain the nature and meaning of friendship.
She runs her ideas by her roommate, Gloria, who tells her that she
sees Martha as a vestigial organ to Jane. Jane says: ``Martha is
not a vestigial organ. . . . I think of Martha as a sort of echt
friend. . . . The model on which all other friends must be based.
And so this entire shipload of strangers has partaken of her
essence.''
</P>
<P>
   That shipload of strangers, Jane's fellow tourists, includes a
number of first-rate eccentrics, characters who may seem a bit
over-contrived, except to readers who've been on group tours.
Schine makes evocative and interesting use of her story's setting,
the starkly beautiful home of the giant tortoise and the
blue-footed booby, among many rare species.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's persistent intellectual probing can't, of course, lead
her to the evolutionary reason for friendship, ``this oddest of all
organisms.'' But it gives her a fresh appreciation of Darwin's
wisdom and, more important, it leads her to understand the nature
of her friendship with Martha, and to self-understanding.

BOOKS, UNLIKE TOYS, DON'T BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whew! Having survived Christmas, parents now face the challenge
of finding something wholesome for the kids to do when the new toys
break, batteries run down or boredom sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Try a book or two. Here are some of the standouts among recent
releases. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ONE, TWO, SKIP A FEW! FIRST NUMBER RHYMES &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Roberta Arenson (Barefoot Books, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona artist Arenson uses collages and watercolors to
illustrate 20 counting rhymes familiar to several generations:
``There were 10 in the bed, And the little one said: `Roll over,
roll over;' '' ``Four little fishes swimming out to sea, One met a
shark! And then there were three.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids enjoy reciting the rhymes and might even pick up some
counting tips. The pictures, which have a folk art quality to them,
feature children of all races, not to mention frogs, elephants,
chicks, cows and monkeys. For ages 2-5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT IF THE ZEBRAS LOST THEIR STRIPES? &QL; 
 &UR; John Reitano; illustrated by William Haines (Paulist Press, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if zebras suddenly split into two types: all
black or all white? Would they still be friends? Would they live in
separate zebra lands? Would their children play together?
</P>
<P>
   This parable about prejudice is charmingly written and
delightfully illustrated. Reitano's simple narrative is easy to
read, without being preachy. Haines' vivid pictures of jungle
animals are active and bold.
</P>
<P>
   Sure to spark discussion, this volume is a worthy addition to
classroom and home libraries. For ages 4-6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SPOT'S BEDTIME STORYBOOK &QL; 
 &UR; Eric Hill (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $12.99)
</P>
<P>
   The ever-popular Spot, a favorite character of early readers, is
featured in this 10-story collection. Stories include ``Spot's
Windy Day,'' ``Spot in the Snow,'' ``Spot at the Fair,'' and
``Sweet Dreams, Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The puppy appeals to young children because his day goes a lot
like theirs. He's got a Mom who warns him not to get muddy when he
goes out to play because she just finished cleaning the house, a
Grandpa who is sporting enough to ride bumper cars, and two close
friends, Helen and Tom, a hippo and an alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, primary colors carry the illustrations. The text is
written in short, declarative sentences with lots of dialogue. For
ages 4-6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CARIBBEAN DREAM &QL; 
 &UR; Rachel Isadora (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $15.99)
</P>
<P>
   Take a trip to an island in the West Indies, where children run,
splash, fish, dance and sing in the tropics. Isadora, a
professional ballerina turned children's writer and illustrator,
has won awards for previous works. Her realistic, warm watercolors
capture joyful play, with an exotic Caribbean twist. For ages 4-6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BASKETBALL BUDDIES &QL; 
 &UR; Jean and Dan Marzollo; illustrated by True Kelley (Scholastic,
$3.50)
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic's ``Hello Reader!'' selections help kids hone their
reading skills by focusing on subjects of interest to them. The
inexpensive paperback series has grade-level guidelines to help
adults make selections.
</P>
<P>
   In this piece, ``Too Tall Paul'' is teased about his height by
other kids, and he feels like all feet on the basketball court. But
he keeps practicing, and learns how to use his height as an asset.
On the day of the big game _ guess who saves the day? For ages
5-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE WAITING PLACE &QL; 
 &UR; Marc Sutherland (Abrams, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Dr. Seuss book ``Oh, The Places You'll Go!,'' in
which the sticky ``waiting place'' immobilizes people who are just,
well, waiting for something to happen? How about Maurice Sendak's
``Where the Wild Things Are,'' about a recalcitrant boy whose
flight of fancy takes him beyond the confines of his room? Put them
together and you have this imaginative tale.
</P>
<P>
   A young boy who can't fall asleep entertains himself by
imagining a series of adventures: marching with soldiers of the
Queen of England; playing chess with a gryphon and floating on
slippery seas with Vikings. The story is told in an appealing
rhyme, and the intricate charcoal illustrations are unusual,
bordering on bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, a land surveyor and forester, says the moral of the
book is: ``If for some reason you find yourself in an unpleasant
situation, dream of better places and then go make them real.'' For
ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY TOWN &QL; 
 &UR; William Wegman (Hyperion, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   Wegman's hilarious weimaraners, popularized on ``Sesame
Street,'' spoof every schoolchild's challenge: searching for an
original book report topic. ``Chip'' dons the garb of several
occupations, appearing as a potter, school crossing guard,
construction worker and grocery clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting weimaraner characters like the school librarian, town
doctor and local barber offer Chip help along the way. Just as he
nears panic, Chip realizes that his report doesn't have to be in
writing. A photo essay about the town folks is just the ticket! Get
ready for giggles. For ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FINDING OUT ABOUT WHALES &QL; 
 &UR; Elin Kelsey (Owl Books, $9.95)
</P>
<P>
   Beluga whales are such expert mimics they can even repeat bird
calls. Some male killer whales live with their moms their whole
lives. Blue whales are the largest animals in the world, exceeding
the size of a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Fun facts about the world's most awe-inspiring creatures fill
this paperback, the first volume in the new ``Science Explorers''
series that not only tells what we know but how we know it.
Scientists and researchers explain their findings about various
species of whales, which are shown in dramatic pictures. A great
pick for budding marine biologists and undersea explorers. For ages
8-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE SOUL: THE FAMILY STORYBOOK COLLECTION &QL; 
 &UR; Lisa McCourt; illustrated by Pat Grant Porter (Health
Communications,
 &UR; $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does schmalz like the ``Chicken Soup'' folks. This
collection assembles the best of the best for kids: ``The Goodness
Gorillas,'' ``The Best Night Out With Dad'' and ``The Never
Forgotten Doll.'' The themes show how kindness turns a school bully
into a friend, generosity seals a friendship, and thoughtfulness
brightens an elderly woman's birthday. Action-packed illustrations
capture the emotions that bring the points home. For ages 8-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE CHILDREN'S BOOK OF AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by William J. Bennett; illustrated by Michael Hague (Simon &AMP;
 &UR; Schuster, $21)
</P>
<P>
   From the pilgrims to Neil Armstrong, America's heroes are
celebrated in 17 stories, songs, poems and folk tales. Bennett, a
former cabinet officer, based his selections on stories that show
how perseverance, ingenuity, hard work and compassion shaped
American history and its character.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King's dream, Paul Bunyan's ox, and young Abe
Lincoln's love of books are chronicled. Interspersed are songs and
verses, among them ``America the Beautiful,'' ``I Hear America
Singing,'' and ``Home on the Range.'' Beautiful realistic
illustrations and top-quality production make this large-format
treasury a keepsake volume about Americana. For ages 8-12. &QL;

ONE LAST PURVEYOR OF `GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK' BIDS FAREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 700,000 listeners of New York radio station WQEW-AM are
about to experience their own version of The Decline and Fall of
Western Civilization. Anyone not abreast of the station's current
circumstance will receive a jolt to the senses when he or she tunes
this week expecting to hear a selection from the Great American
Songbook and instead encounters something known as Disney Radio.
</P>
<P>
   WQEW, 1560 on the AM dial, bills itself, and rightly so, as
``The Home of American Popular Standards.'' This is where the great
treasure trove of popular songs that represent, in the opinion of
many, America's ``classical music'' are heard around the clock.
This is not some treacly ``Music of Your Life'' station. What one
hears on WQEW is, to borrow a phrase, the good turtle soup, not
merely the mock.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the format has been under assault for the past three
decades, but it has been firmly established in New York, first on
the legendary WNEW and, since 1992, on WQEW. But come midnight
Monday (Dec. 28), in the city where so much of this music was
written and first performed, in America's entertainment capital, in
the ``New York, New York'' of Sinatra, his voice will no longer be
heard. Disney has paid the station's owner, The New York Times, a
staggering $40 million for an eight-year lease in order to replace
Sinatra with Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No Tony Bennett. No Mel Torme. No Joe Williams.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   And no Jonathan Schwartz, who, more than anyone else, is the
public face of the station and the music in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a tragedy filled with joy,'' sighs Schwartz. ``WQEW
was a joy.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No Irving Berlin. No Cole Porter. No Richard Rodgers. No
George Gershwin.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   When WQEW changes its format, the most prominent casualties will
be Schwartz's ``Sinatra Saturday Show,'' which is the Granada to
all those Asbury Parks on other stations, and his incomparable
five-hour Sunday show, which has served as a loving tutorial for
his enraptured listeners without interruption since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the capital of American music, to lose this show is
obscene,'' declares local music critic James Isaacs, himself a
much-missed presence on our own airwaves. ``There is no show in
America that mixes classic American pop standards with show music,
jazz, contemporary music, and even classical music from the
perspective of someone who knows all about the music and
performers, and who is a published novelist and short-story
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No Judy Garland. No Ella Fitzgerald. No Billie Holiday.
No Sarah Vaughan.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   What is so utterly frustrating about all this to those whom it
will most affect is that WQEW is not a sick station. In a recent
book, WQEW placed a healthy 19th out of 70 stations in overall
listenership. There remains an audience for this music.
</P>
<P>
   But it's strictly business. ``If someone offered me $40 million
for this station,'' says Schwartz, ``I'd certainly take it.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No Fred Astaire. No Billy Eckstine. No Louis Armstrong.
No Bing Crosby.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who has financial backers, is actively engaged in
seeking another spot on the dial for this cherished American art
form. Meanwhile, he has become affiliated with Lincoln Center,
where he has put together upcoming tributes to composers Harold
Arlen in February, and Richard Rodgersin March. With the benefit of
just one newspaper ad, each sold out in seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my experience with music, ballet and theatre,'' says
Nat Levanthal, president of Lincoln Center, ``I have never seen
such an immediate reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, someone in New York wishes to hear American treasures
Barbara Cook and Maureen McGovern swap choruses of Arlen companion
pieces ``Hooray For Love'' and ``Down With Love.'' Clearly, someone
in New York is interested in spending a few hours being entertained
by the music of geniuses such as Arlen and Rodgers, whose 27th-best
melody would represent someone else's career masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No Lorenz Hart. No Ira Gershwin. No Oscar Hammerstein II.
No Johnny Mercer.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The effect of losing WQEW will be catastrophic for performers,
since this station is nothing less than the home office for what
is, arguably, America's most enduring artistic creation. ``This
station has served me and my records very well,'' says guitarist
and singer John Pizzarelli. ``They have been playing me, not once a
week, but several times a day since 1983. I just did six weeks in
Las Vegas, and once or twice a night someone would come up to me
and say, `I hear you on Jonathan all the time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is not just old people. Thanks to this station, the
music is being kept alive for people under 40. This is not a dead
art form. People are out there doing it, making a living from it. I
am living proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ron Della Chiesa introduced Rebecca Parris to an
approving New England audience via his irreplaceable ``Music
America'' program on WGBH-FM, so, too, has Schwartz created
audiences for a number of deserving performers, including the
gifted Pizzarelli and a talented singer named Nancy LaMott, whose
career he championed on the air before her untimely death nearly
two years ago. A radio station can be a powerful vehicle for
entertainment good, and the ultimate winners are, of course, the
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing WQEW would be devastating,'' agrees Cook. ``This is one
of the ways those of us in the cabaret field get new fans and new
listeners. Someone will hear something and say, `Who's that? What's
that song?' Where will this music be heard now? What am I going to
listen to? This is all hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No ``Oklahoma.'' No ``Guys And Dolls.'' No ``My Fair
Lady.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   This is the music of our century. It is the music that carried
America through two world wars, the music that was the seed of an
entity known as American musical theater, the music that inspired
thousands of brilliant composers, lyricists, and singers who, when
the history of this century is recorded, may very well represent
the most valuable and appreciated of all American exports.
</P>
<P>
   No ``Cheek To Cheek.'' No ``Lady Is a Tramp.'' No ``Night Aand
Day.'' No ``All The Things You Are.''
</P>
<P>
   One week from Monday (Jan. 4, 199) there will be a spot on the
radio dial in our most influential city for news, a spot for
business, a spot for sports, a spot for talk, a spot for classical,
a spot for country, and a spot for straight jazz, a spot for scores
of ethnic groups, a spot for Elvis, a spot for Wu-Tang Clan and
many spots for Bare Naked Ladies, but there will be no spot for
Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a preview of what's in store for us after the
millenium, the 21st is shaping up to be a bad century.

   Here are budget lines for the first installment of the Cox
Millennium package on the 2000th anniversary of Christianity. It is
running in two parts, the first on Sunday, Dec. 27, the second on
Saturday, Jan. 2. CoxNet will produce a full-page layout for each
of these two parts:
</P>
<P>
   This package is for Sunday, Dec. 27: MOVED LAST WEEK
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-OVERVIEW _ Almost 2,000 years ago, a man named Jesus
was born and the world changed forever. The impact of Jesus echoes
through the millennia. It has profoundly changed the way people
view God, the world and each other. Over the next two weeks, and
the coming year, Cox Newspapers will take a look at Jesus, focusing
on the spread of Christianity, first in and around its homeland in
the Mideast, later through Europe and the Americas, and ultimatley
around the world. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-CHRISTIANS _ JERUSALEM _ Despite their urban settings
and the politics that engulfs them 2000 years later, the sites
where Christ was born, lived and died are still powerful ``faith
strengtheners'' for millions of Christians world wide. Visits to
the region by Christians _ and they constitute about 75 percent of
Israel's 2.3 million annual tourists _ remind them that Jesus was
human and the ideals he practiced can be practiced by others. The
physical sites still make Jesus' story real. Christian
denominations have picked their favorite spots. Catholics come to
Jerusalem's Old City, where they often rent wooden crosses and walk
the supposed path Jesus took with his cross. Traditional
Protestants gravitate toward the Church of the Nativity and
Evangelicals head for prayer nearby in the Shepherd's Fields.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service) 35.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-SCENES _ JERUSALEM _ Short vignettes from the places
where Jesus was born, lived and died, focusing on what they look
like today, what visitors think of them and how they fit into
today's political, social landscape. (Kaplow, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday, Jan. 2: MOVED TODAY
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-FUTURE _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ There is a new trend
in this old city. For about a year, Christians have been putting
crosses, usually lit electrically, on their homes and shops. It is
largely seen as a sign of a population that is free, but is a
minority and feels insecure. Christians are a divided minority. In
Israel, Arab Christians benefit from a healthier economy and some
even serve in the Israeli army. In Palestinian areas, they face a
military occupation and a stagnant economy _ driving many to
emigrate to the United States. But, 2000 years after it was founded
here, it would be a mistake to predict Christianity's demise in the
Holy Land. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) 25.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-SYRIAC _ JERUSALEM _ Two thousand years later, you
can still
</P>
<P>
   hear the language. About 3,000 Syriac Christians cling to their
lifestyle in the walled city of Jerusalem and still practice
religion in Aramaic, the language of Christ. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service) 20.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-AMERICA _ Two thousand years after Jesus's birth, the
relationship between his native people, the Jews, and his
followers, the Christians, is complex. Some evangelical Christians
are Zionists, believing that the Temple in Jerusalem must be
rebuilt so that Jesus can come again. But some of these same people
think they must proselytize the Jews. A look at American Christian
attitudes toward Israel and its people. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 30.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MILLENNIUM COVERAGE:
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, Jan. 3: MOVING WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MILLENNIUM _ C'mon, you're not going to usher in the new
millenium by popping the top on a Pink Champale and staring at Dick
Clark on the TV, are you? This once-in-a-lifetime event demands a
once-in-a-lifetime celebration, whether it's frolicking with a
million pagans in the California desert or sipping Dom Perignon in
your own private Times Square hotel, yours for the low rental price
of $3 million. We've spanned the globe, or at least plowed through
a mountain of brochures, to bring you the wackiest, weirdest, most
daring and most extravagant millennium parties. Call it Y2K _ 2 the
extreme. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<HEADLINE>
ILLUSTRATOR DRAWS ON HIS ROOTS IN HISTORY OF JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ It took a lot of chutzpah for Stan Mack to
do what he has done.
</P>
<P>
   To attempt to consolidate 4,000 years of Jewish history _ from
Abraham's first discussion with God in the desert to today's
turmoil over peace in the Middle East _ into a 265-page book and of
all things, in cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what Mack, a 62-year-old New York City
illustrator, set out to do in his new book, ``The Story of the
Jews: A 4,000-Year Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I concluded that there was room for a popular overview of
Jewish history that put everything into perspective,'' Mack said in
a recent interview at the Schenectady Jewish Community Center.
``There are a lot of books out there on this subject. But they are
deep and heavy and only offer a slice of the pie without context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of the Jews'' is wryly humorous and a little
irreverent, consistent with the style Mack used in the Village
Voice strip for which he is perhaps best known, ``Real Life
Funnies,'' in which he depicted New Yorkers at their neurotic best
and worst.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1994, Mack lurked and eavesdropped his way around
the city, reporting what he heard and saw through drawings and
captions in his weekly Voice dispatch. A disclaimer stating ``All
dialogue guaranteed overheard'' appeared at the bottom of the
strip, and to this day, Mack swears by it.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Mack's first book. While working for the Voice, he
also illustrated several children's books, and in 1994, he wrote
``Stan Mack's Real Life American Revolution'' _ a cartoon book of
American history from the perspective of ``the bottom up.''
</P>
<P>
   While working on that book, Mack discovered he had a knack and a
love for research, and the seeds for longer projects were sown.
Soon after he completed ``Real Life Revolution,'' Mack started to
think about spirituality, mortality and family. He said he links
this in part to the fact that his children were getting older, and
also to his first root canal.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never considered himself very Jewish, Mack began to
wonder about his ancestors. Around the same time, an editor asked
Mack if he had ever considered writing a Jewish history book.
Slowly, the concept of ``The Story of the Jews'' came into focus.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Mack takes a lot of poetic license in ``The Story
of the Jews.'' He calls Paul, a Jewish man who broke from
traditional Judaism to encourage others to accept Jesus Christ as
their savior, ``a press agent for Christianity.'' Paul is depicted
carrying a sign that reads: Monotheism Made Easy. Gain Without
Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Further along in his book, Mack explains the evolution of
Hasidism, whose founders saw the sacred in everyday life and
encouraged ecstatic prayer, singing and dancing. Above a small
village of reveling Jews, Mack draws this dictum issued from on
high: Shake it, but don't break it!
</P>
<P>
   Mack describes the tone of his book as ``fatalistic and ironic,
but far less sarcastic than my strip.'' Its easy-to-read style, he
said, grew out of drawing ``Real Life Funnies'' for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am practiced at having a conversational tone with my
readers,'' Mack said. ``After all, I've been talking to Voice
readers for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Limiting himself to 265 pages was not easy, Mack said. The
book's original manuscript stood several feet high. Mack jokes that
he simply ``cut from the bottom'' _ a technique many journalists
suspect their editors resort to when faced with the need to trim
lengthy stories.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust, arguably one of the most weighty events for Jews
in modern history, Mack addresses only briefly. Under the tally of
the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis, Mack drew a stark,
smoking skull. He chose not to dwell on the Holocaust because he
was afraid it would overshadow the rest of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to blot out the entire tapestry of Jewish
history, but to be able to take its place within it,'' Mack said.
``So what I drew is bold, simple, black and raw.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, in trying to encompass 4,000 years, Mack glances
over some events in the ``The Story of the Jews,'' such as the
famous tale of Moses returning from Mount Sinai with God's Ten
Commandments only to find the Jewish people worshiping a golden
calf they had constructed while he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Hanukkah is absent, although the battle that is its
precursor, in which the mighty Jewish Maccabees fought to take back
Jerusalem from the Syrians in 162 BCE, is included.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mack does not yet have an interested publisher, he said
he would like to work on a companion book to ``The Story of the
Jews,'' which would include a detailed history of Jewish holidays
and customs. For the moment, however, Mack is content with this
completed book, which gave him the chance both to use his creative
talents and delve into his personal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know this history of my own last name,'' he
said. ``Growing up, there was no way to find out where my
grandparents came from _ my parents were too interested in
assimilating to ask. I was curious; I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I did the book. But also to have an adventure and a
good time.''

JUST IN TIME ... A COMPENDIUM OF TOASTS THAT HAVE SERVED OTHERS
WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment is almost upon you. On Thursday, sometime during the
evening, you may have to raise your glass on high and give a toast.
Will you deliver a gracious, thoughtful message or mumble a
careless, thought-free ``cheers''?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, most of us botch the salutation when the moment comes.
It's not surprising; the art of toasting has become an endangered
social skill. This is unfortunate, and not just because you will
spend the rest of the evening whispering ``shoulda coulda woulda,''
diluting your shame with single-malt eggnog. A proper salute before
bending the elbow adds a much-needed refinement to the proceedings,
a suavity and polish that complements the convivial spirit of the
holidays. More so than, say, belching.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, correcting this problem is not difficult, for some
of the best toasts are the simplest, such as the Irish line, ``As
we start the New Year, let's get down on our knees to thank God
we're on our feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, suggestions so you do not falter when called upon to
offer that drinking pledge, a bit of background to prepare you,
rules to toast by, wonderful old salutes from which you can crib,
and well-known film toasts, many of which are fine, but some of
which (''Live long and prosper'') you should not use, no matter
what your blood-eggnog level.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TOASTING HISTORY:
</P>
<P>
   From ``A Brief History of the Raised Glass'' by Paul Dickson
(Crown Publishers, $19)
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks insisted that fermented salutes came in threes, one
for Mercury, one for the Graces and one for Zeus. The Roman Senate
decreed that Augustus must be honored with a raised glass at every
meal. The Scots and Scandinavians drank from the skulls of their
fallen enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish had a nasty barroom habit of cutting the throats of
Englishmen while they were drinking. This prompted the expression
of drinking to someone's health, a promise of sorts not to garrote
your drinking partner.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``toast'' did not come into the working vocabulary
until the 17th century when an actual piece of roasted bread was
floated on the drink. The reason has been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The clinking of the glasses, a Christian custom, is to ward off
the devil, who is repelled by bell-like noises.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the toastmaster came about in the mid-17th century.
The duties entailed proposing and announcing toasts, staying sober
and offending no one.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TOASTING ETIQUETTE:
</P>
<P>
   Stand. Toasts must be delivered upright while holding the glass
straight from your shoulder in your right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Practice. Prepare ahead of time and keep it short.
</P>
<P>
   Be positive. A toast should always end on an upbeat note and
clearly indicate when it is time for all to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Clink. After the toast, but before drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Join in. Toasts can be sealed with a sip of champagne, wine, a
mixed drink or a nonalcoholic beverage. Never refuse to participate
in a toast. It is better to toast with an empty glass than not at
all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Korbel Champagne
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BORROWED, HEAVILY, FROM THE IRISH:
</P>
<P>
   May those who love us love us,
</P>
<P>
   And those that don't love us,
</P>
<P>
   May God turn their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   And if he doesn't turn their hearts
</P>
<P>
   May he turn their ankles,
</P>
<P>
   So we'll know them by their limping.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Who is a friend but someone to toast,
</P>
<P>
   Someone to gibe, someone to roast.
</P>
<P>
   My friends are the best friends
</P>
<P>
   Loyal, willing and able.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's get to drinking,
</P>
<P>
   Glasses off the table.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Here's to long life and a merry one.
</P>
<P>
   A quick death and an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty girl and an honest one.
</P>
<P>
   A cold beer _ and another one.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's better to spend money like there's no tomorrow, than to
spend tonight like there's no money.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wine comes in at the mouth
</P>
<P>
   And love comes in at the eye;
</P>
<P>
   That's all we shall know for truth
</P>
<P>
   Before we grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   I lift the glass to my mouth,
</P>
<P>
   I look at you, and I sigh.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Butler Yeats
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Be timely:
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the New Year
</P>
<P>
   And a fond farewell to the old;
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the things that are yet to come
</P>
<P>
   And to the memories that we hold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A song for the old, while its knell is tolled,
</P>
<P>
   And its parting moments fly.
</P>
<P>
   But a song and a cheer for the glad New Year,
</P>
<P>
   While we watch the old one die.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you resolve to do,
</P>
<P>
   On any New Year's Day,
</P>
<P>
   Resolve to yourself be true
</P>
<P>
   And live the same old way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate toast:
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate toasts were the party-making moment when the czars
ruled Russia, and when George III sat astride the throne in
England. A rousing ultimate toast was often the highlight of
banquets in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the drinking portion of the evening during this
period would often last eight to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the appropriate moment, all the guests would rise, stand on
their chairs and place their right foot on the table. The glasses
were raised, the toast delivered, the drink drained in one gulp.
The glass was hurled over the left shoulder to the floor, against
the wall or into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate toasts are now definitely out of style,'' says Paul
Dickson, author and American toasting authority. ``A pity, because
they could do a lot to liven up suburban dinner parties.''

departure left just two black head coaches. Now the question again

SANITIZING A CITY, A STREET AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The City Council of Davis, California, the
bicycle helmet and political correctness capital of the world
(sorry, Berkeley), has decided to retroactively punish a dead man
because of his moral failures.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis City Council voted to change the name of Sutter Place
to Shasta Way because a retired history professor told them that
famed California pioneer John A. Sutter was ``an immoral man, a
sexual predator, a rapist and an enslaver of native Californians.''
</P>
<P>
   A biographer of Sutter, Richard Dillon, said that the
Swiss-German settler of the Sacramento Valley may have consorted
with women other than his wife (probably not an indictable offense
in a college town like Davis), but said Sutter was not a rapist, a
sexual predator or an enslaver of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Sutter's virtues or vices, the City Council of
Davis has made a great advance in government _ one that the
Republican Party could follow.
</P>
<P>
   It now can judge the morality or immorality of the dead, and the
dead can't sue or hire spinmeisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the years before the discovery of gold, (Sutter) was
perhaps the most important and most colorful character in
California,'' wrote Erwin Goode in ``California Place Names.''
</P>
<P>
   After the discovery of gold, California was inundated by
colorful characters, many of them immoral by somebody's standards,
and now immortalized on street signs.
</P>
<P>
   Street-sign purification, and punishing the dead, are mighty
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans adopted the Davis strategy of punishing
immoral dead persons, they could wait to impeach President Clinton
after he dies, when the odds of the comeback kid coming back are
much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Impeach a dead president? The Republicans are making it up as
they go along, anyway. Also, they keep saying Clinton is dead, and
it keeps turning out he isn't. They should wait for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators on the left have been trying to nail Thomas
Jefferson on morals charges for years. They finally got him with
DNA evidence, and they didn't even have a blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   Now a family in Chicago has renewed hope of proving it's
descended from an affair between George Washington and one of his
slaves, named Venus. If this family manages to make its case, just
think. Using the Davis precedent, we can rename Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mudville might be more fitting, regardless of whom the father of
our country fathered.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the Davis action for San Francisco are even
more staggering than they are for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Board of Supervisors has been condemning the
living for their immorality. They usually direct their resolutions
at dictatorships other than the one in San Francisco, though.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can pass condemnatory resolutions locally. San
Francisco has a huge population of the immoral dead, especially by
the supes' standards of immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Kearny and Stockton streets would be gone, as would Sloat
Boulevard, because they're named for officers who took part in the
immoral Mexican War.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Street would get a nice Native American name like Shasta,
of course. Shasta was a tribe, not a soda, incidentally. Forget
anything named Funston _ this was the general in command during the
Earthquake and Fire, but there's also the matter of the imperialist
Spanish-American War, in which he played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac could lose his alley because he hated anti-war
protesters and was in denial about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Avenue? Sorry, you'll be drinking your Columbian on
Indigenous People's Street. You can be darn sure Broadway would be
something else, too.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is famous for street-name fights, like the long
battle over Cesar Chavez Street. That was a tough one. It would be
easier to bring morals charges against forgotten people on street
signs.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it is in the new West. All you have to do is make
an accusation, and the next thing you know, the guy's name isn't
hanging from a lamppost anymore.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, who was the city of Davis named for? Perhaps the
Davis City Council should look into this. The city was named for
Jerome Davis, a rancher in the 1850s who owned 400 acres of land,
where he grew wheat and oats, had orchards and vineyards and grazed
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   If the evidence shows that Jerome Davis slaughtered and ate
those cattle, the Davis City Council could be pressured by its
large animal-rights constituency to change the name of its own
city.
</P>
<P>
   How about Bicycletia?

THE BEEF IS IN `HI-LO COUNTRY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I once set out to kill someone,'' says a
grim-faced young man in the opening moments of the strikingly
beautiful new cowboy movie ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' The line
establishes a sort of western noir tone from the outset, but the
movie actually has a lot more to offer. ``The Hi-Lo Country''
stands as a good account of what it was like to be a cowboy just
before and then immediately after World War II and how the war
years inevitably altered ranching traditions and the men who
respected the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Against the big sky and stretching horizons of Hi-Lo, N.M., we
meet a couple of hard-living cowboys, quiet, moody Pete Calder
(Billy Crudup) and a mythic hell-raiser named Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Pete and Big Boy were best friends before the war, and
when they return from years of distinguished fighting, they pick up
right where they left off _ raising cattle, working the land, and
chasing women and good times.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the only thing that can stop these two throwbacks is
their tenacious desire to do things the traditional way in the face
of the sweeping technological advances. ``What's the fun of being a
cowboy,'' Big Boy wonders, ``if you lose the pure and simple joy
that comes from a cattle drive?''
</P>
<P>
   Pete and Big Boy have one other problem _ they love the same
woman who, quite inconveniently, is married to an associate of the
area's biggest landowner, Jim Ed Love (the always enjoyable Sam
Elliott). Since Big Boy made his move on the mesmerizing Mona
(Patricia Arquette) first, Pete stays away _ or at least tries to _
out of friendship. Then, too, he has a steady relationship with the
sensible Josepha (Spanish sensation Penelope Cruz), which helps him
get through Hi-Lo's cold winter nights. Unfortunately for Pete, he
just can't lose his desire for Mona.
</P>
<P>
   Many filmmakers, most notably the legendary Sam Peckinpah, have
been trying to adapt Max Evans' classic novel, ``The Hi-Lo
Country,'' since it was published in 1961. English director Stephen
Frears (``The Grifters'') may not be the most obvious choice to
bring the story to the screen, but working from a solid screenplay
by Walon Green (whose first screenplay was ``The Wild Bunch''),
Frears does a capable job of depicting a time and way of life not
often shown on film. (He also has a good eye for the land's
enormous sky and wide-open horizons.)
</P>
<P>
   The love triangle is actually the movie's least interesting
element. It's not only unconvincing, but Patricia Arquette's Mona
is never adequately defined. Fortunately, though, the movie never
overplays the entanglements, preferring to stay on the surer ground
of the friendship between the two men. Frears also does a fine job
of capturing and conveying the lingering resentments between the
ranchers who went off to war and those who stayed behind and got
rich when beef prices shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson gives the performance of his career playing the flawed
man's man, but then he was probably destined to portray a guy named
Big Boy Matson. Harrelson imbues him with a freedom of spirit that
matches the movie's vast spaces. And, in the end, it's the man and
his land that you'll remember most about ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' &QL;

demanding, so weird. Good thing they tend to suffer from severe
medical imbalances. Otherwise, how could we sympathize with them
through a whole movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' is the latest in the ``Shine''-inspired
line of films about oddball classical musicians. This one has a
pleasing extra dimension, however, in that it is also about a
highly complex relationship between two nearly telepathically close
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Played by England's high priestess of the unhinged, ``Breaking
the Waves' '' Emily Watson, and the fine Australian actress Rachel
Griffiths (``Muriel's Wedding,'' ``Children of the Revolution''),
Jacqueline and Hilary du Pre are one enchanting sister act,
mentally as well as musically.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie (Watson) is the family genius, a supremely talented
cellist who, with her husband, the Argentine/Israeli pianist and
conductor Daniel Barenboim (James Frain), was the darling of the
'60s and '70s classical music scene.
</P>
<P>
   As a child flutist, Hilary overshadowed Jackie but lost her
confidence as her sibling's star ascended. The love of a good man,
irreverent conductor Kiffer Finzi (David Morrissey), brought Hilary
more personal than professional stability; still, the bucolic bliss
they enjoy together on an ancient, picturesque farm is markedly
more satisfying than Jackie's triumphant but isolating (and
seemingly endless) world concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the movie's best scenes come at midpoint when Jackie, on
the verge of a nervous breakdown, leaves Barenboim and descends
like a fury on her sister's homestead. Insisting that Hilary permit
her to sleep with Kiffer, Jackie seems every inch the selfish prima
donna we've presumed her to be, insensitively bent on taking yet
another precious part of her good sister's life away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce (``Welcome to
Sarajevo'') does not allow matters to unfold quite so simply. In an
artsy but successful ploy, part of the story is told from Hilary's
perspective, then from Jackie's quite different view of things.
Empathic as the two women are, they see things quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice is that for all the resentment and rivalry inherent
in the story, the film is too openhearted to dwell on
recriminations. Besides, it has something more manipulative to
emphasize. Jackie comes down with multiple sclerosis, and the last
act of the movie can't help but focus on her physical and emotional
decline, which Watson plays with rather too much twitch technique.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Watson's performance is impressive. She
studied the cello diligently to make her concert scenes look
convincing (Caroline Dale provides the actual music on the
soundtrack), and she gives them a consuming, very physical quality
that no doubt was a large part of the real du Pre's stage appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck, like Hilary was, with the less showy role, Griffiths does
a marvelous job all the same. She makes Hilary the compassionate,
rational heart of the movie without either idealizing the character
or making her an object of pity; neither small accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Anand Tucker, a British documentarian. He's big
on low-slung track-ins and swooping camera moves when Jackie's
playing, and he displays similar, self-consciously arty
affectations at other times. But he knows enough to keep the drama
focused on behavior, and even though some of that feels
prepackaged, there are more than enough unique, specific
personality notes here to make ``Hilary and Jackie'' well worth
seeing and hearing. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You'd think that word would be out on the motel
grapevine about Mel and Sid. Every time this pharmaceutical Bonnie
and Clyde checks into a place in ``Another Day in Paradise,''
somebody seems to wind up dead either by shotgun or overdose. And
these guys never hang around long enough to pay the carpet-cleaning
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Mel (James Woods) is a petty thief who thinks of himself as some
kind of highwayman philosopher. Sid (Melanie Griffith) is his
beautiful junkie accomplice, handy with a needle and a firearm.
``Another Day in Paradise'' is about what happens when this wayward
couple decides to take a couple of kids (and since this movie is
directed by Larry Clark, you know what kind of ``Kids'' we're
talking about) on the road with them for a spree of heists, drug
deals and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' demonstrates Clark's maturation as a
visceral filmmaker, someone with the courage of his convictions,
which, in this case, means showing a world populated by people with
a complete lack of convictions. In the end, this film amounts to
little more than just another junkie-thugs-on-the-run movie (and
one starring Woods doing yet another variation on his tough-guy
routine), but it's a well-made one with some snappy performances,
crackling confrontations and a down-and-dirty Stax soul soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens with a bracing, nickel-and-dime (literally)
robbery as emaciated teen-age Bobby (Vincent Kartheiser) breaks
into a community college and shakes down a couple of vending
machines for a weighty bag of coins. The job doesn't quite go off
as planned, though, and soon Bobby is dragging his skeletal frame
(and the change) back to his squalid flat, bruised, battered and
hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby lives with his gaunt girlfriend, Rosie (Natasha Gregson
Wagner), and Danny, another drugged-out youth. With the teens'
spindly, heroin-chic look, the place could well double as the
setting of a Calvin Klein perfume advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   To get Bobby back on his feet, Rosie calls Danny's uncle, Mel,
who arrives bearing bandages and syringes. Bobby, in a daze, asks
Mel if he's a doctor. ``Yeah, I'm a doctor, kid,'' Mel answers.
``I'm a doctor shooting you up with heroin.'' Soon Bobby is well
enough to sit up in bed and watch the snowy interference on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Mel sees something in Bobby and proposes they go into business
together. Soon, Bobby and Rosie, Mel and Sid are cruising America's
highways and byways in Mel's magnificent Coupe de Ville, stealing,
shooting up and making new friends. (There's a particularly
riveting episode involving a group of thugs called Hitler's
Henchmen.)
</P>
<P>
   It isn't surprising that Bobby and Rosie start seeing Mel and
Sid as role models, especially given what we learn of Bobby's
abusive father through a brief flashback. But it's just as
inevitable given the source material (Eddie Little's book) and
Clark's penchant for realism that this is one dysfunctional family
that isn't going to live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Woods could play this gun-toting jerk in his sleep, and while
Griffith, too, isn't exactly breaking new ground, it is nice to see
her flexing her acting muscles in a smart, tough role. The kids
(Kartheiser and Gregson Wagner) cover the most emotional ground,
and they cover it well.
</P>
<P>
   Clark fills the rest of the movie with an array of weird
characters, including James Otis as a gun-selling minister who will
cast out Satan while handing over a Saturday night special. To
quote one of the soundtrack's many gritty grooves, he's ``some kind
of wonderful,'' as is the movie in its own perversely unpleasant
way. &QL;

`AFFLICTION' CHILLS TO THE BONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nick Nolte has played so many raging losers in his
career that you'd think he'd have exhausted his insight into the
condition long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' suggests that the pit of despair Nolte draws from
is bottomless. A summing-up of everything this distinctive,
distinctly American actor is about, ``Affliction'' is the kind of
dark, bone-chilling showcase that comes around once in a career, if
at all.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just Nolte's show. James Coburn also does his best
work ever in the film. These two performances should not be missed
by anyone who cares about acting or cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Those who only go to the movies for enjoyment, however, will
want to steer wide of this relentlessly bleak exercise. For the
second time in a row, the most depressing movie of the year has
been adapted from a Russell Banks novel set in a snowbound northern
hamlet with no hope of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was Atom Egoyan's dead children special ``The Sweet
Hereafter.'' This one's by Paul Schrader, a writer (``Taxi
Driver,'' ``Raging Bull'') and director (``American Gigolo,''
``Mishima,'' ``Light Sleeper'') hardly known for a cheery view of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Painful as it is, however, ``Affliction'' proves a better fit
for Schrader's downbeat sensibility than ``Hereafter'' was for
Egoyan's. It's Schrader's most perfectly realized directing effort
since his first, the uncharacteristically humorous ``Blue Collar.''
</P>
<P>
   But as good as the directing is here, the film's bleeding soul
lies in Nolte's towering wreck of a performance. He's Wade
Whitehouse, officially the police chief of little Lawford, N.H.,
but actually the errand boy of the town's only successful
businessman (Holmes Osborne).
</P>
<P>
   Just as well; Wade's never been able to handle real
responsibility. Unhappily divorced and abhorred by his preteen
daughter, he tries to be an affable guy but is always too late, too
stoned, too loud, too delusional and/or too rough for anything he
attempts to do.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Wade through a particularly rough patch of
winter. He decides to sue for custody of his unwilling offspring,
gets it in his head that a hunting accident was actually a murder
plot between his only real friend (Jim True) and his resented
employer, and he can't quite marshal the proper attention toward
his waitress girlfriend Margie (Sissy Spacek). Throbbing through
all of this, like a reminder of the gaping wound where his
self-esteem should be, is the mother of all toothaches.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly equipped to fumble through these converging,
immediate crises, Wade must confront the big, basic one. His
father, Glen (Coburn), the alcoholic sadist who made Wade the mess
he is, has let his wife freeze to death in their isolated
farmhouse. Now Wade and his brother (Willem Dafoe) who got away
must confront the vicious monster on the intimate battlefield
they've avoided their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   Something, inevitably awful, has to give.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Who'll Stop the Rain'' through ``The Prince of Tides,''
``Cape Fear,'' ``Q&AMP;A,'' ``Mother Night,'' ``U-Turn'' and the
current ``The Thin Red Line,'' Nolte has excelled at portraying
extreme psychic stress. But none of those roles had quite the
completely lived-in quality he brings to Wade Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Coburn serves up a frighteningly sustained act of
cruelty. He leaves no doubt about what drove his son to such
lifelong ruin. Indeed, the major question one asks upon leaving the
scorched emotional snowscape of ``Affliction'' is how Wade managed
to maintain, however tenuously, for as long as he did. &QL;

ASIAN WOES CRIMP EXPORTS ON WEST COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Exports from the San Francisco Bay area plunged
18 percent in the third quarter, signaling the region's
vulnerability to the economic troubles in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area Council, which conducted the quarterly study, said
the region was particularly vulnerable because it is about twice as
dependent on exports for economic growth than other parts of the
country, in part because of its concentration of manufacturers
producing high-tech goods.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the area's exports are shipped to East Asia,
where economies also rely heavily on the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Financial specialists said while they had not seen a percentage
drop this great since the recession of the early 1990s, export
levels and the area's overall economy remained relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years have been phenomenal (in terms of)
growth in the Bay area. The economy of the Bay area is now growing
at what we've seen historically,'' said Joe Nation, editor of the
Bay Area Economic Pulse, published by the Bay Area Council, a San
Francisco-based public policy institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is how much more financial turmoil we should see
overseas,'' he said. ``Unless we have a complete collapse in Asia,
which I think is unlikely, we've probably seen the worst in terms
of the drop in exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists had less confidence in the ability of the
struggling Asian countries to recover anytime soon, especially
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is the linchpin to the entire East Asian regional
economy. Until Japan shows signs of real improvement, the outlook
for East Asia remains a bit downbeat,'' said Rob Valletta, a senior
economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Valletta, citing statistics from the Massachusetts Institute for
Social and Economic Research, said California exports to East Asia
fell 20.6 percent in the first nine months of 1998 compared to same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Arredondo, assistant secretary at the state Trade and
Commerce Department, said the estimates of Japan's debt range from
the conservative $500 billion to as high as $1.5 trillion. In
contrast, he said, the savings and loan scandal in the United
States added up to a comparatively modest $160 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But helping to offset the Asian turmoil, California's exports to
Latin America and Europe have been strong, Arredondo said. The
introduction of the euro next month and computer upgrades to
correct the year 2000 problem have helped create demand for
technology-related exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever in European economies, banks will be
able to talk to each other electronically,'' Arredondo said. ``The
know-how to do that is coming from California.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Western Europe, Canada and Mexico account for about
40 percent of California's total exports, according to the Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Tritt, assistant coordinator for economics at the San
Francisco-based Asia Foundation, said some Asian countries, such as
South Korea and Thailand, have already shown signs of an upturn. He
admitted the size of those economies pales in comparison to
Japan's, but said the improvements show that financial reforms are
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should start seeing a strengthening in the region towards
the end of 1999,'' he predicted. ``China has been riding this
through without a significant contraction. And we're seeing a
number of countries doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area Council's report, which was released Monday, shows
that employment remained healthy. Unemployment for the region in
September rose slightly to 3.8 percent from 3.7 in September 1997,
but was still well below the state average of 6.3 percent.

</P>
<P>
   MONTEREY-WINES (Undated) _ For California winemaking in the late
'70s, if Napa and Sonoma were the diplomatic equivalents of Paris
and London, Monterey was considered Bucharest. When mentioned at
all, Monterey was slammed for producing cabernets that tasted a lot
like the local asparagus. But for 20 years Dan Lee has been in the
thick of things as the region's growers and winemakers, after
ripping out the cabernet vines and replacing them with chardonnay
and pinot noir, have pushed Monterey into serious contention as a
producer of top-quality, exciting wines, with the best yet to come.

   AMERICAN-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ Proust had his madeleine. For
me, the catalyst was seared foie gras with pomegranate seeds and a
spicy pear and pepper chutney. Proust's little cake sent him on a
journey back in time, but my savory plate made me contemplate the
future. And it looks very promising. When this epiphany occurred I
was sitting in Tabla just after it opened. What intrigued me was
the fact that the ingredients went together in a way that seemed
completely natural. Looking around, I realized that everything
about the restaurant felt natural. Only a week old, Tabla seemed to
have been open for years. A momentous change has occurred as the
booming economy has bolstered chefs' and restaurateurs' confidence
to a whole new level. American restaurants have finally come of
age. By Ruth Reichl.

<P>
   COOKING-TRENDS (Undated) _ As exhilarating as the fast-moving
food world can be, over the past few years, it has felt more like a
car speeding out of control. Trends have bombarded us from all
directions; cookbook sections in bookstores have grown into
complex, multicolored labyrinths; restaurant dishes have become
feats to deconstruct, both physically and sensually. Even home
cooking, which so often evolves out of restaurant cooking, has
become muddled. Now, just as chefs tossed aside overwrought French
cuisine to revel in the simplicity of nouvelle cuisine, many
contemporary cooks are pulling away from fusion cooking and
free-wheeling experimentation and heading in an entirely new
direction _ toward simplicity. By Amanda Hesser.

   &UR; FOCUS: CHRISTIANITY AT 2000: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Dec.
31) The celebrations that will mark the beginning of the year 2000
are actually acknowledging an anniversary of the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth. Christians believe that through the birth of Jesus
Christ, God became human. Whether or not he was God incarnate,
Jesus changed the world. His impact on history, politics and
culture over the past 2000 years cannot be understated.

   ENTERTAINMENT: (Available by 2 p.m., Wed., Dec. 30) Politics has
made the spectacle of human behavior very distasteful in recent
days, and though none of it should be ignored, some of it must be
put at a distance for at least some of the time. So it's easy to
escape into the world of animal fables and animation, gazing at old
MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons on cable television, following
nightly episodes of ``The Simpsons,'' watching ``Babe'' on video
and then going to the theater to see the sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''

   &UR; TRAVEL: CHATTANOOGA, TENN.: &LR;  Like fences, bridges make good
neighbors. That's especially true of the Walnut Street Bridge over
the Tennessee River. The pedestrian span between Chattanooga 's
Market Street and Veterans Bridges links the chic Bluff View Art
District on the south bank and still-developing-but-definitely-cool
Frazier Avenue on the North Shore. Though quite different in
character, these artsy enclaves are two of the hippest
neighborhoods in this vibrant metropolis that has rejuvenated its
once-derelict downtown and has more to offer visitors with each
year.

Rockies. According to Conde Nast Traveler's poll of the top 50 ski
resorts in North America, Colorado was declared the favorite
destination among experienced skiers.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MILLENNIUM TRAVEL: The night of Dec. 31, 1999, is still
more than a year away, but movers and shakers in the travel

   &UR; FOCUS: CHRISTIANITY AT 2000: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Dec.
31) The celebrations that will mark the beginning of the year 2000
are actually acknowledging an anniversary of the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth. Christians believe that through the birth of Jesus
Christ, God became human. Whether or not he was God incarnate,
Jesus changed the world. His impact on history, politics and
culture over the past 2000 years cannot be understated.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PILGRIMAGE OF FAITH: Undeterred by the grime and urban
chaos of Jerusalem, believers are deeply moved by their visit to
Jesus' homeland.

   WITH: TIMELINE: Graphic showing a look at events from 40 B.C.
through 44 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT: (Available by 2 p.m., Wed., Dec. 30) Politics has
made the spectacle of human behavior very distasteful in recent
days, and though none of it should be ignored, some of it must be
put at a distance for at least some of the time. So it's easy to
escape into the world of animal fables and animation, gazing at old
MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons on cable television, following
nightly episodes of ``The Simpsons,'' watching ``Babe'' on video
and then going to the theater to see the sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''

   &UR; TRAVEL: CHATTANOOGA, TENN.: &LR;  Like fences, bridges make good
neighbors. That's especially true of the Walnut Street Bridge over
the Tennessee River. The pedestrian span between Chattanooga 's
Market Street and Veterans Bridges links the chic Bluff View Art
District on the south bank and still-developing-but-definitely-cool
Frazier Avenue on the North Shore. Though quite different in
character, these artsy enclaves are two of the hippest
neighborhoods in this vibrant metropolis that has rejuvenated its
once-derelict downtown and has more to offer visitors with each
year.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CHATTANOOGA DINING: A guide on where to eat when visiting
downtown Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: If you're planning a ski trip, head for the
Rockies. According to Conde Nast Traveler's poll of the top 50 ski
resorts in North America, Colorado was declared the favorite
destination among experienced skiers.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MILLENNIUM TRAVEL: The night of Dec. 31, 1999, is still
more than a year away, but movers and shakers in the travel
industry have been hard at work preparing for what many of them
insist will be the biggest party the world has ever seen. But there
could be rip-offs in store for the unwary consumer.

<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: &LR;  Chevrolet's Tracker may be slow to grow, which is not
a bad thing, but it is developing rather quickly, thanks to
membership in the high-volume, highly competitive arena of small
sport-utilities.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: How do you know when you need new brakes?
What is that squealing noise when stopping or the chirping noises
while still on the move? Those are just two of the questions you
should know the answers to when the subject turns to brakes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: &LR;  MILLENNIUM BUG: With the Millennium Bug's
sting only a year away, businesses and governments haven't

   MURDOCH-BAYLEY _ (Oxford, England) _ Iris Murdoch, the
celebrated author of 26 rigorously intellectual novels, stood
uncertainly in the doorway of her living room, her face frozen in
the blank expression that is a sure badge of Alzheimer's disease.
It was only when she saw her husband, the critic, professor and
novelist John Bayley, that a flicker of comprehension sparked in
her eyes. But it was gone, as quickly as it came. Bayley talks
about his 40 years Murdoch, and his new memoir, ``Elegy for Iris,''
due out in January. By Sarah Lyall.

PBS AIRING AN UNDERWHELMING `STREETCAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you must see Andre Previn's opera, ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' be sure of one thing: You will never
encounter it sung better than on the PBS ``Great Performances''
telecast Wednesday night (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   You can rest easy, too, that the version on the tube, taped
during the second, third and fourth performances at the War
Memorial Opera House last September with the composer in the pit,
provides a more cogent and balanced souvenir of this San Francisco
Opera commission than what one encountered at the Sept. 19 world
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The project represents a considerable act of faith on the part
of PolyGram Classics, which released the performance on three
compact discs last week (Deutsche Grammophon 289 459 366; the
commercial video will follow).
</P>
<P>
   There's also no doubt that the Tennessee Williams-inspired opera
(Philip Littell's libretto is drawn almost completely from the
play) has become a career milestone for soprano Renee Fleming,
whose Blanche DuBois lends the opera its only shred of emotional
depth.
</P>
<P>
   What else is there to recommend? Kirk Browning's TV direction
focuses Colin Graham's original Opera House staging, and the San
Francisco Opera has found another opportunity to reach an
international audience, though the announcer's hyping of the
1999-2000 season is a tad aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, we must deal with the opera itself, and the news
isn't so good. The premiere was reviled by most of the 140 critics
who attended, not because they had it in for neophyte opera
composer Previn, who commands enormous respect, but because the
failings of the opera are so evident.
</P>
<P>
   On television, those blemishes emerge with even more force than
in the theater. Previn writes in a neo-Straussian idiom that wears
you out with its rampant prettiness long before the three hours
have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Only Blanche and her hapless suitor, Mitch (a definitive
performance by tenor Anthony Dean Griffey), are even minimally
characterized. The brutish, but terrifyingly perceptive Stanley
Kowalski (baritone Rodney Gilfry) is not even assigned an aria.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem is that Previn simply lacked the gift to
translate Williams' tragedy to the lyric stage. He sets the
libretto, but never transcends it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' text is so suffused with poetry that it's a bit
painful to experience Previn's respectful attempt to find a place
for lyrical expansion. Blanche's ``I Want Magic'' and her
distracted monolog, ``I Can Smell the Sea Air,'' are all you get
for sitting through three hours of undeveloped melodic cells and
bland orchestral commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Again, one is amazed at how little Previn avails himself of the
ensemble form. Rarely do you hear two voices raised simultaneously;
why delve into opera at all if you ignore what opera does best? The
composer has an obligation to convince us that his source is in
need of music.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, what seemed overblown in the Opera House appears
natural on the tube. Fleming wisely dropped her ludicrous Old South
accent after opening night. Gilfry, whose larynx seemed less
lubricated than his pectorals at the premiere, is in better voice.
Soprano Elizabeth Futral's conflicted Stella remains the major
discovery of the production, and although the cast's diction is
superior, subtitles are a boon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the burning issue hasn't gone away. Why, on the eve of
the 21st century, would opera General Director Lotfi Mansouri
commission an opera that is so 19th century in its format and
orientation?
</P>
<P>
   This ``Streetcar Named Desire'' also raises an issue about
imposing subjects on composers. Has any great opera ever been
written without the composer choosing his own text? We shall see
what happens in 1999, when the Lyric Opera of Chicago unveils
William Bolcom's ``A View From the Bridge'' (based on Arthur
Miller's play) in September and the Met premieres John Harbison's
``The Great Gatsby'' in December.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are high in both cases, but these _ let's face it _ are
the projects that receive the publicity, the recording contracts
and the TV exposure. Yet in their reliance on an assigned source,
these same works may be telling us that opera remains a subservient
species of artistic endeavor.

   MONTEREY-WINES (Undated) _ For California winemaking in the late
'70s, if Napa and Sonoma were the diplomatic equivalents of Paris
and London, Monterey was considered Bucharest. When mentioned at
all, Monterey was slammed for producing cabernets that tasted a lot
like the local asparagus. But for 20 years Dan Lee has been in the
thick of things as the region's growers and winemakers, after
ripping out the cabernet vines and replacing them with chardonnay
and pinot noir, have pushed Monterey into serious contention as a
producer of top-quality, exciting wines, with the best yet to come.

   AMERICAN-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ Proust had his madeleine. For
me, the catalyst was seared foie gras with pomegranate seeds and a
spicy pear and pepper chutney. Proust's little cake sent him on a
journey back in time, but my savory plate made me contemplate the
future. And it looks very promising. When this epiphany occurred I
was sitting in Tabla just after it opened. What intrigued me was
the fact that the ingredients went together in a way that seemed
completely natural. Looking around, I realized that everything
about the restaurant felt natural. Only a week old, Tabla seemed to
have been open for years. A momentous change has occurred as the
booming economy has bolstered chefs' and restaurateurs' confidence
to a whole new level. American restaurants have finally come of
age. By Ruth Reichl.

   COOKING-TRENDS (Undated) _ As exhilarating as the fast-moving
food world can be, over the past few years, it has felt more like a
car speeding out of control. Trends have bombarded us from all
directions; cookbook sections in bookstores have grown into
complex, multicolored labyrinths; restaurant dishes have become
feats to deconstruct, both physically and sensually. Even home
cooking, which so often evolves out of restaurant cooking, has
become muddled. Now, just as chefs tossed aside overwrought French
cuisine to revel in the simplicity of nouvelle cuisine, many
contemporary cooks are pulling away from fusion cooking and
free-wheeling experimentation and heading in an entirely new
direction _ toward simplicity. By Amanda Hesser.

   FBN-FREEMAN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports of The Times column: There
are now seven coaching vacancies in the NFL, thanks to the wave of
dismissals on Monday, when the ax fell on five head coaches from
Baltimore to Seattle. One of those dismissed was Ray Rhodes, whose
departure left just two black head coaches. Now the question again
facing the league is whether teams will make a real effort to
interview black candidates for the current openings, and hire
several of them, or whether the situation won't change much at all.

 EAGLE ROCK, Va.: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But still the connection was made. Slowly but surely
Mississippians began signing on to the Assembly, or investing it
with their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Two among them live on a road in Lamont, Mississippi. It's a
road that leads to a shack, that is really a home, a good home,
because two people who've never left each other's side live there.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette and Leeandrew Priest's children are all grown, living
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a daughter in Jackson,'' he says, making Jackson sound far
away as Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
   There's a three-inch layer of green sewage running through the
backyard, around the sides of the house. Odessa Carter, who lives
across the road, who was the first recruit for the Assembly in
Lamont, is standing with Claude King next to the Priests, looking
down on the sewage, shaking her head, vowing that the Assembly will
do something. She mentions putting pressure on the local health
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The couple don't know how they hold on. They hold on by holding
on to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Claude King had said that the Assembly in
Lamont will have to get every eligible voter registered. When
that's done, he said, there will be a face to face meeting with
Lamont health officials. ``It's a powerful tool,'' King says about
voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Claude King's next stop is a restaurant in tiny Marks,
Mississippi. He's looking for Robert Jamison, the Assembly's man in
Marks. Jamison eventually shows, and he's hungry. Soon enough,
there's a plate of food in front of him: lima beans and corn bread
and candied yams and fried chicken. A glass of ice tea, sweetened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through rural areas, and you have people who don't even
know elections are going on,'' Jamison says, vowing that the
Assembly will change all of that.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later he's on Cotton street _ Martin Luther King once
visited Cotton Street, and someone spotted tears streaking his
cheeks in front of a shack without running water. Now Jamison
stands in front of another shack with green slime that's formed its
own ravine. ``Still,'' he says, turning the clock back and turning
it forward, ``people are living like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He's vowing to do something, to have the people energized by the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's got an office downtown. Sometimes it'll be crowded:
mamas with sons in jail who need help. Mamas whose cupboards at
home are empty of food. People who need jobs. The oil mill in Marks
used to employ 500 people. Now it's down to 90 praying souls who
hope they'll have a job next week, next month, tomorrow. Soon,
Jamison believes, the hungry will be turned into parliamentary
officers. Assembly believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the idea,'' Jamison says about Marks citizens who've
been introduced to the Assembly. ``The Assembly is set up so a
person can express his ideas. Everybody can get up and say their
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles from Marks _ as the Mississippi crow flies _ lies
Glendora. It's Johnny B. Thomas's town. Everybody calls him Johnny
B. He used to work over at Parchman Penitentiary. As Southern
penitentiaries go, Parchman used to be the scariest. Johnny B.'s
daddy did time at Parchman for killing a man outside a grocery
store in Glendora. Victim was a black man so he only got five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Johnny B.'s got the Assembly up and running in Glendora.
He's putting together a library. He's got three books so far. He
had some officials in recently for an economic summit. They held
hands and prayed at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty, unemployment, housing, you name it,'' Johnny B. says
as far as plotting tasks for the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Simply working together is as much a revelation as the prospect
of getting things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blacks came from the plantation,'' the mayor says. ``We've
been totally taught not to do anything together. Back in '68 I came
off the plantation. My momma got lucky enough to get a little piece
of land and got us out.''
</P>
<P>
   A cottony darkness is falling across the delta now. Claude King,
Donald Anderson's man in Mississippi, is heading home.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, everyone has a story. Some just haunt. Some are
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Claude King's story.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, his wife, got sick a few years back. By then they were
separated. Night after night he'd visit her in the hospital.
Sometimes she'd be asleep when he arrived, asleep when he left. But
watching her lying there on crisp white sheets, he started falling
in love again, with Virginia, with the woman he had married, then
distanced himself from. One day, in the hospital, he told himself
that as soon as she got better, he was going to ask her to move
back in with him, to become husband and wife again. One evening he
left. The phone rang at home. When he got back to the hospital
Virginia was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Brian, one of his sons, was walking down a
road, was hit by some speeding fool, and killed. King just cried.
He didn't have enough faith left in him to fill a teacup. Then
Donald Anderson called, told him he needed him in Mississippi, told
him he was important, told him they could save some souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don's different, sure enough,'' Claude King says. ``But you
gotta love him.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`On the verge of glory' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donald Anderson doesn't know why, but he's looked at poor
people, folk with less than fifty bucks to their name, and he's
felt energized, emboldened, strong as an ox all over again.
</P>
<P>
   He's put 60,000 miles on one car, driving from county to county,
state to state. He's felt like a traveling preacher.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he likes most: the improbability of it all. How to
explain Thaddeus Lane, uneducated, now the Surry treasurer? How to
explain Robert Jamison, going in and out of the Marks jail in
Mississippi?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to organize the whole South,'' Donald Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   To him, it's all made perfect sense: the tragedy of Shakespeare
and American slavery; the pure honest gesture of reaching down and
helping the poor; the love of family, those living, those dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everyone,'' he says, ``who can look down over the
plantation on which their ancestors were slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends sometimes wonder if he's a happy man. He's never
married, there are no children. ``No one woman would stay with
Donald,'' says his sister Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems missing from Anderson's life is no match for what
he has made of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of glory,'' he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Anderson is dead. Died in Florida, free as the wind. His
son Donald brought him here, to the mountaintop, placed that
learned and super-educated man in the ground. With the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Old Emma Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harris Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma.
</P>
<P>
   A green-eyed man sat down one day and wrote some verse, apropos
of nothing, save perhaps, life, death, and all the rain that comes
in between. The verse, framed, hangs in his mountaintop home. On
good bright afternoons, the sun slides into the cabin and catches
the words cleanly, lighting them:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If We Shall Die
</P>
<P>
   And Pass Away
</P>
<P>
   Merge with the earth
</P>
<P>
   As if we have not lived
</P>
<P>
   Then Why?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's down off the mountain now, cemetery dirt on his shoes,
heading for Washington, where he knows he'll find some poor folks,
kings and queens to him.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Disney's new film ``Mighty Joe Young,''
Charlize Theron snuggles in the big furry arms of the giant
doe-eyed Joe and sings him a lullaby.
</P>
<P>
   This tender scene is just another example of Hollywood's
continuing love affair with our nearest biological relatives _ the
great apes. And our passion isn't abating. Just look at the number
of recent and soon-to-be released films such as ``Congo,''
``Buddy,'' ``George of the Jungle,'' ``Summer of the Monkeys,'' an
animated, musical version (also from Disney) of ``Tarzan of the
Apes,'' ``The New Swiss Family Robinson,'' an IMAX format
re-creation of King Kong's special effects and James Cameron's
remake of ``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   But with all the films that Hollywood has made, what have we
learned about our cousins?
</P>
<P>
   First, if you want to feel the fur and not get stomped, it helps
to be a blonde like Theron, or Fay Wray in the original ``King
Kong,'' or Jessica Lange in the remake. (These are three women who
can turn to their ``beaus'' and scream ``you big ape'' and really
mean it).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so this isn't very real _ but neither is a 15-foot Joe or a
50-foot Kong. This is zoology according to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Mighty Joe'' is the story of an orphaned gorilla
raised by the orphaned daughter (Theron) of a Jane Goodall-type
naturalist. In her effort to protect him from hunters, she takes
him to the animal preserve in California. There, after being
provoked, he escapes and creates a traffic jam on Hollywood
Boulevard. The big Mouse used a lot of high-priced gadgets to
create the giant, from three animatronic Joes (one 15 feet tall) to
some 30 computer-generated images. And, of course, there was the
man in the monkey, er, ape suit.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1947 ``Mighty Joe Young'' was a naive, charming
fantasy created by Merian C. Cooper and Willis O'Brien (same team
responsible for the famous trilogy of ape films: ``King Kong,''
``Son of Kong'' and ``Joe''). The film tells the story of Jill
Young (Terry Moore, who makes a cameo appearance in the remake),
daughter of an American planter living in an unspecified region of
Africa, who adopts a baby gorilla who grows (for a never-explained
reason) to gigantic size.
</P>
<P>
   Orphaned, Jill and Joe (her gorilla) are discovered by a
fast-talking Hollywood promoter, Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) who
convinces Jill that she and Joe would be safer and happier in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Southern California, Joe is put on display at a
nightclub where he is abused by drunken patrons and runs amok. When
the court orders that Joe be destroyed, Jill, Max (who has suffered
a change of heart over the exploitation of the animal) and Greg
(the love interest played by the laconic, western actor Ben
Johnson) attempt to smuggle the doomed ape out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A quirky production, ``Joe Young'' is probably the only movie
ever directed by a legally blind person. Wounded World War II hero
Ernest B. Schoedsack had lost most of his vision (he could see only
shadows) and directed with an assistant on the set telling him what
was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow war hero Merian Cooper, the legendary showman and
producer, actually created a cinematic parody of himself in the
character of Max O'Hara, who proclaims his lifelong motto of ``Make
It Bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly bigger are the Oscar-winning special effects that mark
the first professional work by Ray Harryhausen (then age 16,
without the benefit of a union card), whose remarkable
character-animation skills lent an unprecedented life, breadth and
range of emotion to the tiny model. An astonishing mixture of live
action and stop-motion animation populate the film. Most memorable:
Joe being lassoed by riders on horseback and the famous orphanage
fire scene.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Tarzan'' films, from a 1918 silent movie starring Elmo
Lincoln (ironically, the most faithful adaptation of the original
novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs) to next year's release of an
animated version, have given the ape his longest run in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Although many actors have played the role of Tarzan, the
performers most associated with the ape man and his jungle love,
Jane, are Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan. Beginning with
``Tarzan the Ape Man'' (1932), a simplified but highly entertaining
telling of the legend, and the sequel, ``Tarzan and his Mate''
(1934), the jungle couple managed to cause a national scandal (this
was in the pre-Hayes code period) due to the ``free love'' plot
lines and O'Sullivan's infamous ``nude'' (she was wearing a body
suit) underwater scene.
</P>
<P>
   They went on to make a number of (more toned down) films,
O'Sullivan eventually dropped out and Weissmuller continuing on
with different actresses in the role of Jane.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about the films is how ``green'' they
appear in retrospect _ decades before ecology became a commonly
used word, Tarzan is unflinching (if monosyllabic) in his
protection of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Apes appear throughout the series, most notably, Cheetah,
Tarzan's chimpanzee sidekick (and comic relief) who would
eventually become so popular that he received billing alongside his
human co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   The '30s and '40s saw apes in ``Murders in the Rue Morgue''
(derived from Edgar Allen Poe's story and the first of at least
five movie versions) and ``Gorilla,'' both starring Bela Lugosi,
``Monster and the Girl'' and a host of other forgettable movies.
</P>
<P>
   However, 1933 marked the release of this genre's premier film:
``King Kong.'' A remarkable achievement and officially one of the
AFI's 100 greatest films, ``Kong'' begins with an expedition to the
legendary Skull Island by filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong _
in another self-parody of the film's producer, Merian Cooper).
Along for the ride are the beautiful Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and Jack
Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), second mate aboard the tramp steamer
chartered for the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the island, Ann is promptly kidnapped by hostile
natives and offered up as a ``bride of Kong.'' The gigantic ape
makes one of the most dramatic entrances in film history, carrying
off Ann with the ship's company in hot pursuit. The title character
fights off armed humans, tyrannosaurs, pterodactyls and giant
snakes (once again there's really no explanation for why these
creatures are inhabiting this island), all the while delicately
protecting Ann from harm. Eventually, Driscoll rescues Ann, and
Kong is subdued by gas grenades. Brought in chains to New York,
Kong is put on display as the ``Eighth Wonder of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Kong eventually escapes. Rampaging through the city and once
again kidnapping Ann, he climbs to the top of the Empire State
Building. A squadron of planes is summoned to shoot him down with
machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Falling, Kong dies at the base of the skyscraper, where a police
officer remarks, ``Well, Denham, the airplanes got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Denham, lowering his head, replies, ``Oh, no. It wasn't the
airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, made for the then-staggering (it was the height of the
Depression) sum of $650,000, holds up remarkably well, especially
Willis O'Brien's ambitious, revolutionary special effects and art
direction (while often overlooked, each miniature and full-scale
set is a virtual work of art in its own right). A true classic.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the success of Kong, Cooper and O'Brien rushed a
sequel, ``Son of Kong'' (1933) to theaters. Made on a substantially
smaller budget ($250,000), the film was a financial and critical
failure and is almost entirely overshadowed by the original.
Although it doesn't stand up against the first film, it is still
worth watching (if you can find it). The story picks up with the
unstoppable Carl Denham (again played by Armstrong) being sued by
apparently every lawyer in the state of New York over the damage
his ``Eighth Wonder of the World'' caused during his rampage
throughout the city. Deciding to return to Skull Island (only in
America could the threat of legal action be more menacing than an
island full of prehistoric predators), Denham discovers the Son of
Kong, who is only 25 feet tall (Dad was twice the size) and covered
with snow-white fur. Kong Jr. is more friendly than his old man,
tagging along with Denham and company, saving them from a number of
savage animals. In a quite poignant ending as Skull Island is
destroyed by earthquakes, the ape cradles the humans in his
upraised hands, even as he himself drowns beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s saw more Tarzan films, Weissmuller being replaced by
Lex Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, et al., but apes played a
lessening role in these films. More significantly, the period saw
the only political entry into the genre with ``Bedtime for Bonzo''
(1951), starring Ronald Reagan playing a college professor who
domesticates the title ape for a scientific experiment. Years
later, political opponents would attempt to ridicule the would-be
candidate for his presence in the film. In a hang-tough,
embrace-the-ape campaign strategy, Reagan pronounced his pride in
the film and his simian co-star. The lesson is clear: You can't go
wrong by proclaiming your love for an ape.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s saw the last of the ``traditional'' Tarzan films and
some overseas oddities like ``Kongo'' (definitive proof the Brits
can't make a horror movie) and ``King Kong vs. Godzilla.'' In a
dramatic example of ``size matters,'' Kong was morphed from his
original 50-foot height to 400 feet in order to be on an equal
footing with his reptilian adversary.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us to 1968's highest-grossing film, ``Planet
of the Apes.'' With the summer of love long gone and a season of
political assassination, riot and weekly casualty reports settling
in, no wonder theater audiences flocked to see the escapist movie
with a message.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Rod Serling from the novel by French author Pierre
Boulle, the film opens with the first interstellar space mission
led by George Taylor (Charlton Heston) crash-landing in an alien
world. Marooned, the only female astronaut dead (a mishap with her
suspended animation chamber), thousands of years elapsed since
their journey began, they explore the planet on foot, discovering
to their astonishment it is inhabited by humans, albeit living at a
very primitive level and without the power of speech. Their
clothing and equipment stolen by these primitives, Taylor is
separated from his crew and is captured by the dominant species of
this world: genetically manipulated, civilization-building apes.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to speak because his own vocal cords have been damaged,
Taylor is treated like a dumb animal in the city of the apes.
Placed in a cage, he is expected to mate with the de-evolved, mute
but beautiful Nova (Linda Harrison).
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to escape, Taylor is netted, and, recovering his
voice, he screams at his tormentors, ``Get away from me, you damn
dirty apes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked, the apes consider Taylor a freak and give him over to
Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (the late Roddy McDowall) for
study.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an attempt by Taylor to intellectually defend
his species (ironic, since the cynical character is actually quite
disgusted by humanity's shortcomings) to the religious, scientific
and military ape ruling elite. Taylor fails, the apes consider man
to be a low, evil animal, and he and Nova escape. While traveling
on a deserted beach, they discover the corroded Statue of Liberty
buried in the sand. Taylor must finally face the truth _ that he is
not on alien ground but has made a thousands-of-years-long round
trip back to his own Earth.
</P>
<P>
   This film has to be complemented on being able to take a
science-fiction idea seriously, something almost impossible for
Hollywood to do. The movie features some great makeup effects and
excellent (restrained) art direction.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing marring the film is a really toxic mix of
ponderous, pompous dialogue and outrageous overacting (a subtitle
for the film could have been ``Planet of the Hams''). The
actor/actress that probably comes off the best is Harrison as the
mute Nova _ this is probably the only time in cinematic history
that at the wrap of production, a performer, dropped to her knees
to thank God she didn't have a speaking role.
</P>
<P>
   But a minor point; this, after all, isn't a genre noted for
thespian greatness, or restraint of any sort. ``Planet of the
Apes,'' an enjoyable thought-provoking film that spawned four
sequels, a TV series, an animated series, an upcoming James Cameron
remake and this interesting anonymous e-mail that recently made its
way around the Internet: ``When John Glenn comes back on the
shuttle, everybody put on an ape mask and bury the Statue of
Liberty in sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the worst ape film ever made is Dino De
Laurentiis' remake of ``King Kong'' (1976). His high-concept
description of the movie has passed into the status of Hollywood
urban legend: ``Monkey die, everybody cry.'' Certainly everyone
cried _ but not in the way that producer De Laurentiis imagined.
Plot, pacing and special effects are terrible (most scenes of Kong
were played by a valiantly struggling, uncredited, Rick Baker _ in
a suit _ whose eventual ape film credits would grow to include
1983's ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,''
1988's ``Gorillas in the Mist'' and this year's ``Mighty Joe
Young.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not through with tormenting the public and despite outcries of
``Why doesn't somebody stop him,'' Dino went on to make the worst
ape-movie sequel of all time, ``King Kong Lives'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   No review of the ape-film phenomenon would be complete without
looking at the famous ape couples, Tarzan and Jane, Fay and Kong,
Bonzo and Ronnie and, of course, Clint and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Which Way but Loose'' (1978) ushered in its own unique
sub-sub-genre of apes-go-trailer-trash.
</P>
<P>
   Universally panned by critics, director/star Clint Eastwood
offered only this mild defense: ``I thought it was a very cool
screenplay.''
</P>
<P>
   The film concerns truck driver and part-time bare-knuckles
fighter Filo Beddoe (Eastwood), his orangutan _ Clyde, Filo's
foul-mouthed mother (Ruth Gordon), neurotic love interest (Sondra
Locke) and a variety of deranged bikers, street-fighting champions,
disgruntled highway patrol officers all out to get our hapless
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde the orangutan deserves special notice for his work as an
animal actor, his expressive face and relaxed manner in the midst
of danger should have propelled him into action-hero stardom, but
Hollywood being what it is, Clyde's career never went anywhere _ he
was inevitably stereotyped as an orangutan.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of ``Greystoke'' (1983), Rick Baker firmly
cemented his name with the special-effects greats. A master of
makeup and animatronics, he gives the simians of the film an
incredible degree of realism. Most of the ``apes'' are actors (a
really talented troupe of artists who exhaustively studied simian
behavior and movement) in animatronic suits who steal the show in
this Tarzan remake.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Hugh Hudson, takes the original Tarzan
material seriously if not terribly faithfully. In tone, the movie
has a lot more in common with Anthony Burgess' ``Quest for Fire''
than Edgar Rice Burroughs, but it's a great film (one of the best
that we're taking a look at) with a knockout debut by French actor
Christopher Lambert in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few serious films dealing with apes is 1988's
``Gorillas in the Mist'' _ the tragic, true story of anthropologist
Dian Fossey's (played by Sigourney Weaver) 20-year struggle to
protect the mountain gorilla. The film chronicles Fossey's work,
with which she eventually became so obsessed that it entirely
eclipsed her personal life. Abandoning family and friends, Fossey
was killed by the same poachers who preyed on the gorillas.
Receiving four Academy Award nominations, this is a moving and
important film.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, most of the films dealing with apes in recent years
haven't been near the quality of ``Greystoke'' or ``Gorillas in the
Mist.'' Hollywood seems to be endlessly recycling the same movies
over and over again. Even when they get an original idea, such as
in the recent ``Congo'' (1995), they crank out a predictable
formula film. From the novel by Michael Crichton, the movie
chronicles the discovery of a race of ``killer apes'' _ gorillas
that were selectively bred and trained in ancient times to heighten
their aggressive instincts for use as extremely lethal ``watch
dogs'' _ a novel yet plausible idea but a bad movie.
</P>
<P>
   With Arnold Schwarzenegger planned to reprise Charlton Heston's
role (one wonders how he'll do with the ``damned dirty apes'' line)
in James Cameron's big-budget remake of ``Planet of the Apes,'' and
Disney's one-two punch of ``Mighty Joe Young'' and the animated
``Tarzan of the Apes,'' appreciative audiences need have no fear
that a new millennium will bring an end to the ape in film.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of these films are fantasies _ in reality, the great
apes are in danger of extinction. If you would like to find out

   &UR; When Donald Anderson first shared his dreams of lifting the
hearts and raising the sights of the South's black poor, a lot of
people rolled their eyes and closed their doors. But that didn't
stop him. Now, after 30 years, his ``Assembly,'' a network of
mini-parliaments, has transformed once disenfranchised men and
women in small, forgotten towns into leaders. Anderson works in the
tradition of ground-up community organizers, but his targets are
among the toughest, and his methods and passion uniquely his own.

LAWYER WHO INSPIRED `CIVIL ACTION' LEARNS NEW TAKE ON LAW

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the new movie ``A Civil Action,'' John
Travolta, in the role of a flashy Boston personal injury lawyer,
makes a momentous decision to take a difficult environmental case
as he overlooks a polluted river outside Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta is on his way back to Boston after meeting with
distraught parents who believe the town's drinking water has
poisoned their children.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't going to take the case, but as he steps gingerly over
multicolored tannery dregs spilling into the river, he sees factory
signs of two giant corporations with deep pockets. He thinks he can
do good and make money.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the film, which is based on a true story, he has
quit law and gone nearly nuts. He's lost his black Porsche, house
and furniture as well as a spot on Boston's Top 10 Eligible
Bachelors List. He has $14 in the bank and a portable radio after
spending more than $2 million of his and his partners' money over
four years on environmental studies, medical tests, depositions and
a four-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the real-life lawyer on whom a book and now the film are
based said he would do it all differently.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Schlichtmann, 47, after bankruptcy and a near breakdown, is
again taking environmental cases, but he's trying to win justice
for his clients outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Woburn experience has taught me so much. It's changed me
as a human being and a lawyer. I'm approaching the world so
differently. Woburn taught me we have to figure this out
together,'' Schlichtmann said in recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann, who acted as legal consultant for the movie, is
representing 60 families in the little town of Tom's River, N.J.,
in a case similar to the one in Woburn. In this instance, he
believes people are dying from brain and blood cancers caused by
hazardous waste from Union Carbide and Ciba-Gigy. Instead of suing
the giant corporations, though, Schlichtmann is negotiating with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's easy. It's very challenging and difficult,
but there's no alternative. It's a recognition that the legal
system is not helpful in solving our problems. Our legal system
encourages behavior that is destructive. The first casualty is the
truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Touchstone Pictures film is based on the 1995 book by New
Yorker staff member Jonathan Harr, who won the National Book
Critics Circle award for nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Readers praise Harr for painstaking reporting and spellbinding
writing that turned an intricate legal case of the 1980s into a
thrilling drama of Schlichtmann's battle on behalf of eight Woburn
families. ``A Civil Action'' was on the New York Times bestseller
list for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Zaillian, scriptwriter of ``Schindler's List,'' has
written and directed the film. Producers are Scott Rudin, Robert
Redford and Rachel Pfeffer.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With John Travolta playing Schlichtmann and Robert Duvall taking
the role of his cunning opponent, an attorney for Beatrice Foods,
the film also tells a compelling environmental tale.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann's business associates are played by William H. Macy
(``Fargo''), Tony Shalhoub and Zeljko Ivanbeck. Kathy Bates takes
an uncredited role as a bankruptcy judge who can't understand how
Schlichtmann could lose it all by the end of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   John Lithgow plays Warren Skinner, the judge who Schlichtmann
believes is out to get him. Stephen Fry, of PBS ``Jeeves'' fame,
portrays the scientist leading the environmental studies. Kathleen
Quinlan plays Anne Anderson, the mother who spearheads the parents'
fight to win retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting close up, the camera records high-spending
Schlichtmann's Boston life of fancy cars, luxurious offices and
expensive clothes as his young firm starts winning big personal
injury settlements.
</P>
<P>
   When the Woburn case takes over in the early 1980s, however, he
spends millions of dollars and four years preparing for the trial
while visiting the grieving families of eight leukemia victims.
</P>
<P>
   The parents tell tragic stories: a 2-year-old dying in his
father's arms while parked near a highway exit on an emergency trip
to the hospital, a dying boy telling his mother he had arranged to
meet her ``in the back left-hand corner of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   As mother Anne Anderson explains to Schlichtmann when he first
goes to Woburn, ``We don't want money. We want an apology.'' From
whom?, Schlichtmann asks. ``We don't know,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann finds the two businesses _ Beatrice Foods and W.R.
Grace _ that he believes dumped TCE, the solvent trichloroethylene,
and other chemicals into Woburn's water supply. Since the owners
won't talk, he looks for the workers, many of them living in Woburn
with their children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's best performances comes from James Gandolfini,
who plays Al Love, the father of eight children. Employed by the
tannery, a subsidiary of Beatrice Foods, he tells Schlichtmann that
barrels of toxic waste were pushed into pits. Others tell of a
waste pond jokingly called the ``swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Duvall, in the role of wise, wily Boston attorney Jerome Facher,
tries to blame bacon, peanut butter, gasoline, Teflon pans, silver
fillings and tampons for the leukemia cluster.
</P>
<P>
   In most drinking water contamination cases, the plaintiffs must
meet a high proof test. They must show that a company's pollution
got to the water supply and that the water caused the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Woburn case, the judge posed a set of questions to the
six jurors after the trial had gone on for four months in 1986.
Schlichtmann had to convince the jurors that the companies'
chemical waste got to the wells by a certain month and year. If
not, Schlichtmann wasn't allowed to present the compelling evidence
of the children's leukemia. The jurors decided that W.R. Grace had
tainted the wells but that Beatrice Foods had not.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann was crushed. He had planned to use the settlement
money from one of the corporations to finance the next stage of the
trial against the other. What he got instead was an $8 million
settlement from W.R. Grace, which equaled about $450,000 per
family, and nothing from Beatrice Foods. (At one point, he had
asked for $410 million.)
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years trying to win an appeal, but he was denied
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann, by then ready to give up law, turned all his files
over to the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been
dragging its feet on the case. In 1989, he borrowed enough money to
move to Hawaii. He stayed for a couple years, at one point nearly
swimming out to sea in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the EPA ordered a $70 million cleanup by W.R. Grace,
Beatrice Foods and some other companies. It was the largest such
cleanup in New England's history.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney indicted W.R. Grace for lying in its
statements to the EPA. W.R. Grace pleaded guilty to two counts and
paid a maximum fine. The companies closed the two plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE ROCK, Va. _ A man who lives atop a mountain here communes
with the dead. He swears they've told him _ the dead that is _ to
rid America of its poor.
</P>
<P>
   So he travels rural roads, into towns that don't show up on
maps, into towns you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he'll be driving, down through the Georgia pines,
across that endless Mississippi Delta, and he'll feel his body get
to aching, he'll feel the sleep climbing up into his eyes, he'll
wish he were twenty years younger. But he just keeps going. Rolling
toward the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Once, right here in Virginia, he drove the car into a ditch.
Asleep at the wheel. Three weeks later he was up, rolling again.
Trying not to think about the busted ribs, the broken hand, or the
dark things the doctor had said about his heart. The dead _ slave
ancestors buried in a plot 30 feet from his front door here _ won't
let him be. ``I can feel them,'' the man says.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harris Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old William Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Emma Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma was Emma Ray's namesake and daughter. Poor thing:
she died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   The world hardly knows the man on the mountain, though he may
have done as much to lift the hearts and raise the sights of the
Southern black poor as any man alive.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Donald Anderson. He's an intellectual. He's kind and
generous. He's also vain _ and, with his wobbly cowboy walk, lofty
manner, and green eyes, something of a curiosity to almost everyone
he meets.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can be absent minded about the small things, Anderson
is a demon about the big picture: Poor folk will rise. And from
that dream has grown an organization _ inspired by the resolute
localism of the British House of Commons and the ideals of Thomas
Jefferson _ that, for thirty years, has been quietly bringing true
grass-roots democracy to rural communities across America's South.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it The Assembly _ a network of mini-parliaments, formed
of 50 citizens each, that is built anew in every town Anderson
enters, that first shadows and then dislodges the traditional
government structure. He works in the tradition of other ground-up
community organizers, but his targets are among the toughest, and
his methods and passion uniquely and entirely his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, everywhere he went, it seemed, folk tugged at
his elbow, dropped words into his ears, told him he couldn't
sweet-talk his way into rural communities as an outsider and
organize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it forty-one times,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For thirty years, in unknown places, in misbegotten towns.
</P>
<P>
   There he stands, in the homes of poor folk, shaking hands that
have lifted contaminated well water that very morning, telling men
who have trouble with the alphabet that they can sidle right up to
Thomas Jefferson and his beliefs and make something large of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen barely literate souls, men and women, transformed into
leaders. In some counties whole political structures have been
upended, turned around, set loose in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments, too, when his whole vision gets reduced to
the simplicity of goodwill _ a warm coat found and draped around
the shoulders of a woman living in a shack the cold wind owns.
</P>
<P>
   In all, his assemblies have brought $20 million in development
to the rural South, but he hasn't been feted at one testimonial
dinner. He hasn't had one medal draped around his neck. He seems
not to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he cares about is a roof over his head,'' says Wyche
Fowler, the former US Senator from Georgia whose friendship with
Anderson dates back 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Anderson _ whose National Community Development Organization
has previously concentrated on the American South _ is moving
north. He wants to reopen the debate about the crumbling cities of
America. The other week he was in Cleveland. Then Washington, D.C.,
where his organization is headquartered. Washington might well be
the nation's largest think tank, where, day in and day out, the
problems seem to outfox the thinkers. There he was, under the roof
of an urban church, eyes gleaming, telling mothers and fathers who
live on a street where crime has started to creep badly to hold on,
telling drug addicts that Thomas Jefferson is getting ready to
march into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on this road before. He was there in the Sixties, when
there was footstomping and rage on behalf of the poor. But then the
political climate changed, the rage quieted. A lot of the marchers
went home.
</P>
<P>
   As for Donald Anderson, he kept dreaming. Then he came down off
the mountain, tossing off the highclass dreams his own parents held
for him _ breaking their hearts without meaning to _ and swearing
to cure a nation of what ails it, rumbling against time as the dead
men and women who sleep near him _ ``the folks in the back yard,''
he calls them _ kept whispering, driving him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeds of hope &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to slip into rural communities, where the citizens
were often distant and disconnected from one another. He planned to
organize in groups of 50. Each group would elect officers and
representatives. Collectively, an Assembly would be drawn from the
group representatives. The Assembly itself would agree on one
problem _ sewers, schools, housing _ and attack it with unity and
vigor.
</P>
<P>
   It was early 1968 and Donald Anderson was looking for someplace
to test his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin told me about Surry,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   That Martin.
</P>
<P>
   They'd met in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   An impoverished old Virginia farming town, Surry had long been a
place where blacks outnumbered whites, yet a black had never held
elective office. In 1959 public school officials _ with the state's
blessing _ boarded up the schools in nearby Prince Edward County
rather than integrate. The move ignited ``massive resistance''
across the state to integrated public education. In Surry whites
pulled their children out of the schools. All-white private
academies flourished.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson reached Surry, he met Walter Hardy, C.C. Pettaway,
and Thaddeus Lane. Three black men. Three poor men.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and Pettaway had risen to become community leaders. Hardy,
who had worked as a gardener and a chauffeur for a well-to-do white
family, was working at a packing plant. Lane was scuffling as a
small farmer. Pettaway got by on welding work.
</P>
<P>
   Three common men. Donald Anderson saw royalty in them. But they
were suspicious of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was a communist,'' remembers Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came here as a surprise to us,'' says Walter Hardy. ``Came
here with a white secretary. That was a no-no in this area. We
didn't know if he was fly-by-night or what. He came here with a
set-up we had never heard of, talking about the British House of
Commons.''
</P>
<P>
   Three men, and not a one without scars.
</P>
<P>
   For years C.C. Pettaway had been quiet as stone. Then they let
the schools go to ruin rather than integrate. He had children, and
they needed to learn, to grip schoolbooks. When the schools finally
reopened, whites didn't return. Somehow a lot of the public
education money got siphoned off into those all-white private
academies. Quiet no more, Pettaway went to court and sued.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, too, until he couldn't stay away from the restaurant any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the ``Whites Only'' sign finally came down at the
Surry House Restaurant, C.C. Pettaway ambled inside. He ordered a
steak. He waited a long time, but it finally came. He sat there,
joyful as a man at a feast. It wasn't the steak, which was actually
a bloody mess when he knew good and well he had ordered it
well-done. It was just knowing it was his.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardy's awakening began when he entered the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I had a country until I went to the Army,'' says
Hardy. ``White officer said to me, `This is your country too.'
Being from little ole Surry, I didn't realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Lane and Pettaway and Hardy wanted to do things,
dreamed of doing things. But even with blacks a clear majority in
Surry, they couldn't crack the ranks of office holders. Truth be
told, they'd never raised a loud voice. They thought Surry would
always be Surry.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Donald Anderson. This stranger to Surry spelled out
his vision in detail, and before long infant hope was born of his
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they want,'' Anderson says. ``They want jobs
for their community. They want better housing. They want recreation
to take the youths off the street. What they want is a better
society.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went in Surry: every month, an Assembly meeting. And every
month, another little community feud stamped out in favor of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' explains Walter Hardy, ``you talk about peanuts
and corn at the same time. But with the Assembly, you weren't
allowed to talk about peanuts until you got the problem of the corn
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, in 1971, the Surry Assembly announced a slate
of candidates to run for board of supervisors. Surry had never had
a black on its five-member board of supervisors, and now three men
_ common men _ were running. And all three won.
</P>
<P>
   In time, too, Thaddeus Lane, an unschooled farmer, a man who
remembers paying a $1.50 poll tax to cast his first vote years ago,
would win election as county treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor rebellion,'' Donald Anderson called it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and the other black board supervisors had no experience
with power. ``We finally knew we had to stop criticizing,'' says
Hardy. ``We had to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   So they brought in experts to offer them technical advice. They
applied for and received foundation funds to help them attack
county poverty. They brought in a doctor. They got funds to build a
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Surry schools were in scary shape. Most of the white
children had been pulled out, and even many rural black kids stayed
away, their parents fearing violence. But in time, propelled by
priorities set in the local Assembly, the Surry school system
revolutionized itself. Good teachers came and stayed. An all-black
school system began to integrate itself as whites poured back into
the system. Surry High School went from last in the state in test
scores to the top third on national standardized tests. Today, 95
percent of Surry graduates go on to further their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Williams is principal of Surry High. If he could work 40
hours a day, he would. It's the kids; they elevate him. He'll see a
knot of kids coming down the hall toward him and it's like
something warm and righteous flowing into him. He'll start
backslapping. He'll start complimenting. He'll start goading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Mr. Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mr. Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this boy here could be brilliant,'' Mr. Williams says,
pulling a kid toward him. ``Gotta stay on him though. Gotta stay on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mornings Frank Williams will be sitting in his office and
the phone rings and it's Don Anderson on the other end. He's coming
into Surry, now. He forgot to call yesterday to make an
appointment, and he's sorry. But he's on the way and he's got some
think tank folks with him and a congressman and a corporate
executive and he can't wait to show them the school, to show them
the classrooms, to share the latest news of the latest test scores
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say, `OK, Don, anything for you,' '' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Anderson, whooshing into the building, quick
hellos to Frank Williams and others, then bolting down the hallway
with his visitors, pointing out kids, poking his head in
classrooms, interrupting the classrooms with his giddiness, talking
in that stop-and-go-like fashion of his _ ``Well, uh, hi, uh, well,
uh, isn't this beautiful!'' Kids getting a good education. It fills
him like helium. Then he's turning, galloping toward the exit
because he's running late for his next appointment. And there's
Frank Williams, standing in the middle of the hallway, smiling,
shaking his head, one eye on the backside of the vanishing Anderson
and the other eye on the kids coming toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance you don't know how to take the brother,''
Williams says of Anderson. ``But once you understand where he wants
to go, the man becomes a giant . . . In the old days we had a
saying. `That brother's been touched.' Don's been touched. You
don't know why.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He had an epiphany' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who would change the lot of America's poor and
disfranchised has never known a day of poverty in his life. ``We
had cars during the Depression,'' Donald Anderson says, twin
touches of pride and arrogance in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was born 66 years ago in Pittsburgh, into a family of Negroes
who walked with arched backs, who flaunted their college degrees.
``We did not hobnob with the humdrum,'' as Anderson puts it.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Celeste, was a teacher, his father, Russell, a
biologist enamored of microscopes, bugs, and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   An aunt was a psychologist. An uncle had an advanced genetics
degree. Another aunt, Helen Baker, would become the first black
woman to attend the University of Maryland law school.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Uncle Sylvester Anderson, who didn't have
credentials to flaunt, but who taught young Donald another kind of
lesson. Sylvester was a river rat in Virginia, where the family's
lineage began. An old black man who beat the last march of slavery,
but who heard enough stories to pass along. Donald Anderson would
sit across from Uncle Sylvester and just stare. His uncle seemed
ancient to him. It was Uncle Sylvester who saved money to buy land
on a mountaintop in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   So Donald Anderson's childhood, wrapped as it was in the
travails of black America, was nevertheless rich in example and in
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Like the one Helen Baker taught him. Diagnosed with a rare form
of cancer as she was about to enter law school, she was given a
year by her doctors. She was blessed with 20 more. On her deathbed
she turned to her nephew, Donald, and with a clarity that was
fairly stunning, summoned up words that would stick with him: ``I
knew that every day I woke could be my last. That meant this
minute, this hour . . . was the most important one. Therefore,
whoever is standing in front of me is king of the world, if kings
are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's father was, he says, ``a brilliant man.'' Also
something of an intellectual pioneer in a race-divided land. He
lectured widely overseas and in his own land, though he knew, when
in America, to travel with a blanket and sheet. Jim Crow didn't
make exceptions for the exceptional, and often Russell Anderson
would wind up bundled up outside.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 the Anderson family had relocated to Washington so
Russell Anderson could begin a medical internship at Freedman's
Hospital (now Howard University Hospital).
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, heady minds were rolling in and out of the
Anderson home. Mordecai Johnson, the influential president of
Howard University, would visit. So would Howard Thurman, the
renowned minister. Young Donald Anderson heard their echoes, saw
their footprints.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy, even with sisters and a brother, a mother and
father, grew lonely. ``Whenever we moved onto a street, all the
`best friends' were already taken,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The friends he did find were between the hardcovers of books.
His sisters and brother would be outside playing, and Donald would
be upstairs, reading, aloud: Victor Hugo, Edgar Allan Poe,
Alexandre Dumas and, above all, Shakespeare.

 By RUTH REICHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Proust had his madeleine. For me, the catalyst was
seared foie gras with pomegranate seeds and a spicy pear-and-pepper
chutney. Proust's little cake sent him on a journey back in time,
but my savory plate made me contemplate the future. And it looks
very promising.
</P>
<P>
   When this epiphany occurred I was sitting in Tabla just after it
opened. As the rich, spicy flavors went rolling through my mouth,
it suddenly hit me that I had never tasted anything quite like
them.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty was not in the newness; to a restaurant critic,
unaccustomed flavors are an everyday occurrence. What intrigued me
was the fact that the ingredients went together in a way that
seemed completely natural. Looking around, I realized that
everything about the restaurant felt natural. Only a week old,
Tabla seemed to have been open for years.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat there thinking about this, it hit me that Tabla was not
the only restaurant that had seemed so good so soon. With growing
excitement I started to review the events of the last year,
understanding that a momentous change has occurred: The booming
economy has emboldened chefs and restaurateurs to take their craft
to a whole new level.
</P>
<P>
   Never have so many excellent restaurants opened in such a short
time. Consider the best new restaurants of 1998: EQ, Babbo, Cena,
La Fourchette, Mercer Kitchen, Michael Jordan's: The Steakhouse,
The Tonic, Chianti, Eleven Madison Park, Bolivar and of course,
Tabla.
</P>
<P>
   Each serves food that is particularly its own, and each does so
in a space with a distinct personality. What is most astonishing,
however, is that all of these restaurants displayed a remarkable
maturity on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Why? I think it is because American restaurants have, finally,
come of age. The cocky young chefs who strutted onto the stage in
the 1970s and '80s have evolved out of the stupid-food stage. No
longer fresh out of school, these American chefs have traveled
widely. They have tasted and learned, and they now have enough
experience to produce signature food without showing off. Heading
into middle age, the best of them display both creativity and
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky young restaurateurs have grown up, too. They have gone
beyond the ``Let's open a restaurant and have some fun'' attitude
of the early days. They have professionalized the restaurant
profession.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they have made their patrons part of the equation.
Architects who were once content to make statements in public
dining rooms are being asked to consider the comfort quotient.
Industries have grown up to deal with lighting and acoustics.
Employees from reservation-takers to busboys are being trained.
Waiters are no longer out-of-work actors trying to pick up a few
dollars between parts. And there is a growing demand for serious
sommeliers who can create wine and beer lists as interesting as the
menus with which they are paired.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for the future? Plenty. The fate of
restaurants, as everybody knows, is tied to the economy. It's not
just because people spend more in times of prosperity. Diners also
become more adventurous when they are flush; it is no coincidence
that the great advances in American dining have all occurred during
bull markets. Remember the early '80s? It was an exhilarating time
when restaurants reinvented themselves to give us New American
cooking, open kitchens and casual chic.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward came the recession of the early '90s, and a spate
of the safe and the dull. People walked around saying, ``It's the
economy, stupid,'' while they settled for plowing through endless
plates of pasta.
</P>
<P>
   When times turn tough, customers turn conservative. In response,
restaurateurs get frightened; many close their doors, and those who
don't, stick to the tried and true, producing copycat cuisine that
is the edible equivalent of Hollywood studios churning out Jaws 3,
4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest changes in the restaurant industry mean that even
another recession should not take us back to those dreary days. For
one thing, this generation of restaurateurs will be equal to the
challenge. For another, they will not be alone, because there has
been one more significant change in the realm of restaurants: The
people who go out to eat have matured as well.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have become confident restaurant patrons. We know what
we like, and are not shy about asking for it. The new American
diner is savvy enough to demand good service, and knowledgeable
enough to demand good food.
</P>
<P>
   Because we would rather be comfortable than correct, the
European style of service has almost disappeared. Because we like
big flavors, our food has become increasingly bold. Another
recession may force us to eat less expensively, but we will not
tolerate eating less well.
</P>
<P>
   What will tomorrow's restaurant be? That is anybody's guess. The
smart money says it will be increasingly eclectic, with more Asian,
Indian and Latin American ingredients turning up on the table.
Judging by what we are eating today, though, one thing is certain:
The food will be very, very good.
</P>

FUNERAL FOR KENNETH STARR'S MOTHER SET FOR WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA SANDBERG  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vannie Mae Starr, the mother of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, will be buried Wednesday in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starr, 91, died Sunday within a week of learning that her
son and President Clinton would share the cover of Time Magazine as
its Men of the Year. Her body was discovered by her housekeeper in
the tiny white home where she had raised Kenneth and two other
children, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   She died of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, according
to the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was doing beautifully right up until the end,'' Kenneth
Starr's older brother, Jerry Starr, said by phone from his late
mother's house. ``We feel very blessed she didn't suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Starr said he believed his mother had died suddenly
because she did not activate an emergency communication device,
called a ``lifeline button,'' that she wore around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his famous brother had each spoken to their
mother by telephone just hours before her death. Kenneth Starr
received the news on Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The independent prosecutor's investigation of Clinton became the
basis of the House vote Dec. 19 to impeach the president, the first
time such a vote was taken since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Vannie Mae Starr had steadfastly avoided the glare of the media.
But in a rare interview last week, she told the San Antonio
Express-News that her son had called her hours after the House
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation never touched on Clinton, Monica Lewinsky or
impeachment, she said. ``He doesn't talk about business,'' she
explained. ``He said he was tired and he was going to bed early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr family lived in Thalia in north Texas when Kenneth was
a child before moving to Centerville and then to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starr, who continued to live in a blue-collar part of San
Antonio until her death, in September described her son as ``just
an ordinary guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A visitation for Mrs. Starr was held Tuesday at Mission Park
Funeral Chapels South, and burial is set for 2 p.m. Wednesday at
the Starr Cemetery in Elkhart, Texas, according to an obituary
notice supplied by the funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Mahan, an informal go-between for the news media and
Starr's mother, said she would remember her as ``very sweet, very
thoughtful and very eager to have her son shielded from any
publicity that was unpleasant or unfavorable. She was certainly a
devoted mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahan, 81, was Kenneth Starr's English and journalism teacher at
Sam Houston High School here in the early 1960s. She had
volunteered to speak to the media for Vannie Mae Starr, knowing she
didn't like the spotlight.

 IMPORT BAN IS LIFTED ON FRENCH GOOSE LIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new government ruling on imported poultry may not send
American chicken producers running for cover, but it's big news for
connoisseurs of foie gras. For the first time, the uncooked livers
of French geese will be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture last week removed restrictions on
the import of raw poultry products from France, as well as from
Greece, Luxembourg and Spain, declaring the countries free of
exotic Newcastle disease, a fatal poultry virus. An outbreak in
southern California in 1971 cost U.S. taxpayers $56 million when 12
million birds had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department said it did not expect much immediate
impact from the ruling, but one importer has wasted no time in
capitalizing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ariane Daguin, an owner of D'Artagnan in Newark, N.J., the
largest distributor of American foie gras in the United States,
said, ``Goose is the first thing I'm going for.'' The fresh foie
gras she carries now is all from domestic ducks. The only fattened
goose livers currently available are imported and always at least
partly cooked, or mi-cuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes well with customs, we will have some
tomorrow,'' she said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be cheap. Fresh, raw goose livers, each weighing
nearly 2 pounds, will be $56.50 a pound, plus $18 shipping for
retail customers. The wholesale price, to restaurants, will be $44
a pound. Ms. Daguin said she was also importing some fresh duck
livers, at $37 a pound retail ($29 a pound wholesale), about 50
percent higher than the price for domestic duck livers.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on raw poultry imports was lifted after inspections were
requested in 1997 by the Directorate General for Agriculture of the
European Commission. The ruling also declared Luxembourg, Portugal,
Belgium, Greece and France free of some diseases, including
rinderpest and foot-and-mouth, which affect swine and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Meat and poultry still may not be imported unless they come from
processing plants that USDA inspectors have determined to comply
with safety and hygiene standards and unless they have the proper
permits. But eventually items like Portuguese linguica sausage may
also be available in American shops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poultry ruling covers not only foie gras but also
chickens, ducks, geese, game birds and eggs, the department said it
did not expect much impact on the American market, since the United
States already produces more poultry than it consumes, and exports
more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Gold, the founder and marketing director of Murray's
Chickens in South Fallsburg, N.Y., which sells chickens to the
better restaurants and fancy food shops, was skeptical about the
new ruling. ``Why allow the import of chickens from other countries
when small growers are closing down because they can't pay their
bills and can't afford the price of feed?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the prices, he may have nothing to fear. If Bresse
chickens, the French birds with blue feet and great flavor, were
imported, Ms. Daguin estimated they would be more than $5 a pound,
double the price of the most expensive chickens sold in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And even that could be affected by bananas, strange as it seems.
A threat by the United States to slap 100 percent tariffs on goods
imported from Europe, because the European Union has restricted
imports of bananas, could raise the price of Bresse chickens to $10
a pound and goose foie gras to more than $100 a pound. It may be
cheaper to get on a plane, but it will still be impossible to bring
any back in luggage. Import bans for travelers remain.

A SEASON TO PONDER THE BIG QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, 1998 is down to its last dry, raspy breath and if we're
lucky we'll usher in 1999 just a couple of days from now. That's
really exciting, isn't it? For most people, this is a time of
expectation, looking forward toward a new horizon and new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's more a time of reflection and introspection. What
have I learned this year? Who can I help with that knowledge? And
how do you clean a harmonica?
</P>
<P>
   I like harmonicas. A blues band without a harmonica is like Al
Gore without a tie. Sure, I could go into this new millennium
without knowing how to properly clean a harmonica, but it's going
to bug me until I find out.
</P>
<P>
   These and other really shallow thoughts occupied my mind during
Christmas dinner as I gorged myself on turkey and impeachment
cobbler. Meanwhile, Aunt Lois and Uncle Johnny had a heated debate
over whether cows have feelings. They grew up on a farm and,
therefore, care passionately about these things. Being a city girl,
I could not contribute anything of substance to their dispute but I
did refrain from eating any of the sliced beef just in case Aunt
Lois was right.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, lack of firsthand knowledge usually doesn't stop me
from joining a discussion, but I was rather tired on Christmas Day.
We had driven quite a distance the day before to visit some friends
and as usual, the trip left me exhausted. I don't know why I get so
tired on these forays because my husband always drives and I always
fall asleep within 30 minutes of leaving home. He doesn't
understand why I can stay awake long enough to make it to north
Dallas, 45 minutes away, but I can't stay awake for the first hour
of a four-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple. I don't like short naps. On a long drive, I know I
have time to take a long nap and then comb my hair and freshen my
makeup. I can't do all of that in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he doesn't talk to me. He just stares at the road and
hums along with the radio. Maybe he's humming me to sleep. Besides,
if you've ever driven north, south, east, or west of any Texas
town, you know that there is absolutely nothing to look at for
miles upon miles except for those sensitive cows.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I survived the trip despite my restless rest and,
although I enjoy sharing holidays with family and friends, I wasn't
all that sad when Aunt Lois retrieved her calf, Esther, from the
garage and bid us farewell. Like dominoes, the rest of the
relations fell out the door behind her.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove out of sight, either Aunt Lois or Esther yelled,
``Happy Moo Year!'' Back in the house, someone had thoughtfully
left us a gift on the dining room table. It was a very pretty but
obviously used harmonica. I smiled and put it in the dishwasher
next to the casserole dish. Don't you just love getting great
things for free?
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy your new year.

THE RIND ON THE BRIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What are the ingredients of the white rind on Brie cheese,
and is it edible?
</P>
<P>
   A. The rind of a Brie _ and any other soft-ripened cheese _ is
where the unripened cheese meets the bacteria that make it the food
we all know. Brie is aged with the help of friendly bacteria called
Penicillium candidum, which attach themselves to the rind of a soft
cheese and encourage it to age from the outside in.
</P>
<P>
   Brie came into contact with these bacteria naturally in the air
of the Brie region of France. But today, most Bries are treated
with a manufactured liquid form of Penicillium candidum. The rinds
are perfectly edible, but some people prefer to cut them off.

HOUSMAN NEEDS NO ASSITANCE BY STOPPARD FOR IMMORTALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not only my opinion that Tom Stoppard is Britain's
foremost playwright of these times, possibly the best of the
century's second half, and surely above any current American
dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his career _ or at least from
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' which established him,
still in his 20s, in 1966 _ it has been evident that Stoppard has
an abiding interest in literature, and a quite literary
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jumpers,'' in ``Travesties,'' in ``The Real Inspector
Hound,'' in ``The Real Thing'' and other Stoppard staples, literary
allusions abound, and the plays are themselves mirrors of respected
literary themes.
</P>
<P>
   After a spasm of down time, Tom Stoppard is with us again, with
a drama whose West End success is likely to be duplicated on
Broadway. The play is ``The Invention of Love'' and surely it is as
``literary'' as any theater piece ever may be.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is hell for the most part, and the central figure is
one who goes there _ Alfred Edward Housman, the scholar-poet,
perhaps the best-known classicist of modern time. Other literary
figures _ Oscar Wilde, John Ruskin _ penetrate Stoppard's drama,
and the flashback device gives us acquaintance with lesser-known
persons of importance in Housman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these is Moses Jackson, the object of Housman's
unrequited love. Jackson's marriage to a woman Housman also knew
has been pegged by his biographers as the pivotal event in the
poet's rather gloomy life. Nobody really knows, but Housman is
figured an inactive homosexual, damned in his own mind if he would,
and damned if he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I heard someone say that Stoppard's play is calculated
to rehabilitate Housman, for whom a return to popularity may be
expected. Oh, the irony! I was reminded of Walt Disney's
exclamation, during production of the animated ``Fantasia,'' that
``This is going to make Beethoven!''
</P>
<P>
   A.E. Housman requires no rehabilitation whatever. Although he
has never been considered a ``major'' poet, his popularity holds
steady through the passing decades, and he remains one of the most
memorized and quoted poets in our language.
</P>
<P>
   His is the voice of loss, of controlled despair. Sadness
underscores even his loveliest lyrics. Mortality is ever lurking in
his verse; and although Housman tells us that ``Life, to be sure,
is nothing much to lose,'' we are left believing that the specter
of mortality hounded him throughout his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   A life so strange. Born into comfortable circumstances in 1859,
Housman was a precocious child and early poet, but he discarded the
pastime when he entered Oxford, where he met Moses Jackson. Housman
was an outstanding student who mysteriously (deliberately?) failed
his finals, and for 10 years thereafter was an obscure clerk in the
London patent office.
</P>
<P>
   When he secured at last a professorship (in Latin) at London
University, he began composing poetry again; and in 1896 published,
at his own expense, ``A Shropshire Lad,'' 63 short rhyming poems in
traditional metric schemes. These ironic and tragic creations
eventually caught on, became the top-selling single book of English
verse ``of all time,'' and never fell from favor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Housman published no more poetry until the oddly titled
``Last Poems'' was issued in 1922, 14 years before his death and
midway through a long tenure as the most distinguished professor at
Cambridge. ``More Poems'' appeared in 1936, the year of Housman's
death, and the entire body of his published work fills one small
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Housman composed his poems in a longhand as rigid as his verse,
in notebooks I have been privileged to hold and behold in the
Seymour Adelman collection at Bryn Mawr College. If Tom Stoppard
hasn't been to Bryn Mawr, he should go there for the altogether
awesome experience of communion with Alfred Housman himself.

MARRIAGE OFFICERS FIND JOY IN TYING THE KNOT FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KENNETH C. CROWE II  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union

   HALFMOON, N.Y. _ Nothing makes Chris Cuttita feel more romantic
than a wedding. When she became a court clerk, she was sure she
would see many people united by the town's judge.
</P>
<P>
   But through an unusual state law, Cuttita is doing more than
witnessing couples celebrating their wedding day: She's tying the
matrimonial knot for them.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttita is a marriage officer _ a position every town, city and
village government in New York can fill but few do because
performing marriage ceremonies is traditionally the province of
mayors, judges and justices of the peace. But a handful of
municipalities choose to appoint marriage officers to act in
reserve. Their only function is to marry people.
</P>
<P>
   It's such an unusual and rarely made appointment that no state
agency keeps track of how many there are in New York. The Secretary
of State's office, which works with local governments, keeps no
records on this appointed job title, which are unpaid positions.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the marriage is performed within the boundaries of
Halfmoon, located in upstate New York's Saratoga County, Cuttita is
doing something that ship captains are not allowed to do under
state law: she's marrying couples as long as they have their
license. Ship captains may marry couples while at sea, but their
jurisdiction ceases as soon as they hit land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best part of my job,'' Cuttita said. ``I'm a
classic romantic. I've been doing it for six years for a lot of
family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In Halfmoon, Cuttita will on occasion do a ceremony twice. The
first time in town hall for the couple, the second time recreating
the ceremony for the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Doing what the bride and groom want seems to be a selling point
for marriage officers. That's what Peter Tulin, the Saratoga
Springs city attorney, has done the five times he has served as a
marriage officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tulin has performed weddings in which a dog took part, prompted
a nervous groom to help him remember his forgotten vows and recited
poetry when the ceremony was running shorter than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because I was honored and touched. I was flattered
that people want me involved in one of the most important parts of
their lives,'' Tulin said. ``Some of the people I knew personally
or through relatives. By the time of the weddings I knew the
couples well.''
</P>
<P>
   Grafton Town Clerk Suzanne Putnam discovered that performing
marriages allowed her to make ``a wonderful gift'' to her brother
Joseph Sciacco and his wife, Patricia. She married them.

DIGGING INTO THE ORIGINS OF SPAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Why is junk E-mail called ``spam''?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Spam is used to describe several different means of flooding
the Internet with the same information, according to the Free
Online Dictionary of Computing.
</P>
<P>
   An E-mail that is sent to thousands of people at the same time
is commonly called a spam.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the term is a ``Monty Python's Flying
Circus'' skit in which a restaurant works Spam luncheon meat into
most of its menu choices. Dishes include egg and Spam; bacon and
Spam; bacon, sausage and Spam; and ``lobster thermidor aux
crevettes with a mornay sauce garnished with truffle pate brandy
and a fried egg on top of Spam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hormel Co. reportedly chose the name Spam by combining the
words ``spices'' and ``ham,'' according to the New York Public
Library Book of Popular Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is a big fan of Charlize Theron from ``Devil's
Advocate'' and other movies. Where can I write to request an
autographed picture?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.P., Colleyville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Theron in care of United Talent Agency, 9560
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 500, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old model broke into acting with ``2 Days in the
Valley'' after losing out on the ``Showgirls'' lead role that went
to Elizabeth Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   Theron, a native South African who grew up on a rural farm, came
to the United States at age 18 and stayed to pursue modeling and
ballet. A knee injury ended her dance career in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I contact the makers of ONZE Mineral Skin Care? I'm
having trouble finding their product.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The ONZE company sells its products directly through mail
order. A catalog of its products is available by calling (800)
866-7151. The catalog's $2 cost is refunded upon an initial order.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
promised a ``prompt and thorough'' investigation Tuesday into
charges that bribes helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen last week by the United States Olympic Committee to chair
a special commission to investigate the claims, Mitchell met for
the first time Tuesday morning with the four other members of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic games hold a special place in the hearts of
Americans, indeed people around the world, and it is up to us to
make sure the selection process for cities lives up to the ideals
of fairness and honesty,'' he said at a news conference here after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is co-chairman of the USOC's ethics committee,
said the investigation will focus on the circumstances surrounding
the selection of Salt Lake City by the International Olympic
Committee (IOC). He added that the panel also will make
recommendations on how to improve the bidding process to ensure
``it is fair and above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the commission will file its report with the USOC
by Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a prompt and thorough investigation,'' said
Mitchell, a longtime Democratic senator from Maine who brokered the
Irish peace talks earlier this year. Mitchell has been mentioned as
a possible mediator in President Clinton's attempt to avoid a
Senate vote to remove him from office in the wake of the House vote
Dec. 19 to impeach him on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC investigation will focus on scholarships and athletic
training given to relatives of IOC members under a $400,000 program
of humanitarian aid from 1991 to 1998 and whether those
scholarships were used to buy IOC votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City Olympic Committee has acknowledged that it
paid nearly $400,000 in scholarships to 13 people, six of whom were
relatives of IOC members before the city was selected for the
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is expected to look into two internships given
to the son of Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze by the city of
Salt Lake in 1993 and 1994, while the city was bidding for the 2002
Winter Olympics. Sibandze's son, Sibusiso, also received bachelor's
and master's degrees from the University of Utah in the mid-1990s,
but it is not known whether he was one of the six relatives of IOC
members who got the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Three other probes of the allegations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced last week that it had begun an
investigation and that a prosecutor from its criminal division had
been sent to Salt Lake City. The International Olympic Committee
also has started an investigation, which is expected to conclude by
Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee is conducting
an internal investigation and plans to issue a report on its
findings Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that Tuesday's meeting helped the five commission
members set the process that will be used to conduct the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the USOC special commission are Donald Fehr,
executive director and general counsel of the Major League Baseball
Players Association; Kenneth Duberstein, former chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan; Roberta Cooper Ramo, a former president of
the American Bar Association, and Jeff Benz, an at-large member of
the USOC Athletes' advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee officials also have promised to
investigate questionable gifts and scholarships given to committee
members by cities in previous Olympic bids.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those gifts and scholarships also involve Swaziland IOC
member David Sibandze. In 1985, his son, Sibusiso, received a
three-month scholarship offer to a Swedish university, while Falun,
Sweden, was bidding to become host of the 1992 Winter Olympics.
That honor, however, eventually went to Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Australian newspapers have reported that a daughter
of David Sibandze obtained a job at a catering institute in Sydney
with the help of the president of the Australian Olympic Committee
during the bid process for the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Senate vote to remove him from office in the wake of the House vote
Dec. 19 to impeach him on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC investigation will focus on scholarships and athletic
training given to relatives of IOC members under a $400,000 program
of humanitarian aid from 1991 to 1998 and whether those
scholarships were used to buy IOC votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City Olympic Committee has acknowledged that it
paid nearly $400,000 in scholarships to 13 people, six of whom were
relatives of IOC members before the city was selected for the
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is expected to look into two internships given
to the son of Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze by the city of
Salt Lake in 1993 and 1994, while the city was bidding for the 2002
Winter Olympics. Sibandze's son, Sibusiso, also received bachelor's
and master's degrees from the University of Utah in the mid-1990s,
but it is not known whether he was one of the six relatives of IOC
members who got the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Three other probes of the allegations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced last week that it had begun an
investigation and that a prosecutor from its criminal division had
been sent to Salt Lake City. The International Olympic Committee
also has started an investigation, which is expected to conclude by
Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee is conducting
an internal investigation and plans to issue a report on its
findings Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that Tuesday's meeting helped the five commission
members set the process that will be used to conduct the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the USOC special commission are Donald Fehr,
executive director and general counsel of the Major League Baseball
Players Association; Kenneth Duberstein, former chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan; Roberta Cooper Ramo, a former president of
the American Bar Association, and Jeff Benz, an at-large member of
the USOC Athletes' advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee officials also have promised to
investigate questionable gifts and scholarships given to committee
members by cities in previous Olympic bids.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those gifts and scholarships also involve Swaziland IOC
member David Sibandze. In 1985, his son, Sibusiso, received a
three-month scholarship offer to a Swedish university, while Falun,
Sweden, was bidding to become host of the 1992 Winter Olympics.
That honor, however, eventually went to Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Australian newspapers have reported that a daughter
of David Sibandze obtained a job at a catering institute in Sydney
with the help of the president of the Australian Olympic Committee
during the bid process for the 2000 Summer Olympics.

EATING WELL: A LITTLE MEDICINE WITH YOUR FOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first loaf of white bread enriched with three vitamins
and a mineral appeared in the grocery store in 1943, only a mad
scientist could have imagined where the manipulation of food would
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fastest-growing category of foods is made up of those
that contain not just added vitamins and minerals, but also
elements intended to prevent heart disease and cancer or to fight
colds and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Called nutraceuticals, designer foods or functional foods, these
pumped-up products blur the line between food and medicine. They
are causing confusion among federal regulators and the food
industry, and concern among nutritionists and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are looking toward self-medication and for ways to
enhance their health,'' said Dr. Michael Heasman, a senior research
fellow at the Center for Food Policy at Thames Valley University in
London. ``It's sort of a tidal wave waiting to crash, driven by
corporate ambition to add more value in a basically static food
market, and by baby boomers disillusioned with conventional health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   There's calcium in Tropicana orange juice and echinacea in Fresh
Samantha drinks; Stonyfield yogurt has L. reuteri bacteria to
protect against salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7. Psyllium has been
added to cereal, frozen entrees, bread and pasta in Kellogg's
Ensemble line.
</P>
<P>
   As functional foods have moved from natural-food stores to
supermarkets, sales have reached $17 billion, said Gene Grabowski,
the vice president for communications of the Grocery Manufacturers
of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to several surveys we've taken, people would rather
get their cholesterol-lowering elements or prevent osteoporosis or
hypertension through tasty foods instead of pills,'' he said. ``You
are going to see a barrage of functional foods in 1999 and 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that this trend is moving faster than federal
regulation. Are these new products food additives, dietary
supplements or new drugs? Each of those is regulated differently.
</P>
<P>
   While new drugs must always have approval of the Food and Drug
Administration, for instance, dietary supplements are barely
regulated at all. And that leaves the public inadequately
protected, because there is often little scientific evidence of
their efficacy to begin with, and because there are no standards
for their purity or for their levels in food.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a delegation from the Grocery Manufacturers has been
meeting with the FDA to lobby on the definition of functional foods
and the way they should be regulated. The list of participants
reads like a supermarket Who's Who: Nabisco, Lipton, Nestle,
duPont, Ocean Spray, Hershey, Coca-Cola, Quaker Oats, General
Mills, Pepsico, M&AMP;M/Mars, Best Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the nutrition and food studies
department at New York University, said that behind the confusion
over regulation is an interesting example of the politics of food.
</P>
<P>
   The Nutrition Education and Labeling Act of 1993 requires the
labeling of food with its nutrition content. That has created a
huge demand for foods perceived as healthful, like those with no
fat. But the law also provides a way for food manufacturers to make
health claims, even though the rules are quite restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was
passed over objections by the FDA. That law provides far looser
regulation of health claims for supplements, and significantly
weakens the agency's authority over them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dr. Nestle said, ``The food manufacturers want to know why,
if the FDA could do this for supplements, why can't they do it for
foods? The whole point of functional foods is to be able to take
advantage of health claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Grabowski of the Grocery Manufacturers acknowledged that his
group felt both ``anger and envy'' about the supplement-industry
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's McNeil Consumer Products Co. is
battling the FDA over the introduction of Benecol margarine, which
the company claims lowers cholesterol. It says the plant components
it has added, which are made from wood pulp, are a dietary
supplement and therefore do not need the agency's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But because the company is making the health claim, the FDA says
Benecol is either an unapproved food additive or a drug and must
either go through an approval process or change its labeling.
</P>
<P>
   While the FDA and McNeil argue over arcane regulations, other
companies are adding such medicinal herbs as Ginkgo biloba to
energy bars, green tea to candy bars and kava to corn chips. As
long as they do not make health claims, the agency must leave them
alone. The label on Fresh Samantha Super Juice with echinacea, for
example, simply says ``Defender of your health.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Kellogg had to go through a two-year process to get
the agency's permission to make the health claim that its Ensemble
line lowers cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Other functional foods already on the market or on their way
include Lipton's Take Control line, currently two margarine-style
products, which contain a soybean extract believed to help prevent
cancer; Eggland's Best eggs, from chickens fed a diet that gives
the eggs 10 times more vitamin E than ordinary eggs; Herbal Kitchen
Prescription soups from Hain, and green teas from Yogi Tea Co. with
ginseng, kombucha or echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   Even Heinz is making a health claim for its ketchup, because
cooked tomato products are higher in the anti-oxidant lycopene than
raw tomatoes. Milk solids are being added to milk to increase the
calcium. Even doughnuts are being supplemented with protein. And
there are dozens of drinks, usually found in natural-food stores
and gyms, that contain medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not wonder drugs,'' Grabowski said of the
supplements whose manufacturers are entitled to make health claims
about them. ``We have to be careful not to overpromise, but at the
same time we don't want to diminish some of their magic, some of
the excitement they are creating.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. Nestle said, ``These products are deluding the public
into thinking that they are going to give greater benefits than
plain old fruits and vegetables.''

THE MINIMALIST: A DISH HANDLED WITH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Osso buco, the glorious Italian dish of fork-tender veal shanks
in a natural sauce, takes time but almost no attention in my
streamlined version. In the two hours or so it takes to cook,
you'll need to stand over it no more than 20 minutes. Even better,
the meat holds up well enough overnight for 90 percent of the
cooking to be done while you're watching television the night
before you serve it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to osso buco lies not so much in the flavors you add but
in the main ingredient and how carefully you handle it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``milk-fed'' veal sold in supermarkets and most butcher
shops remains a product of enforced confinement and formula
feeding. The alternative, sold by natural-food stores and some
supermarkets and butchers, is ``natural'' veal, from calves that
may have been raised at the mother's side or at least allowed some
room to roam before slaughter. It is darker, a little more intense
in flavor and perhaps a bit tougher.
</P>
<P>
   I actually prefer the latter, although my preference may be
influenced by guilt. As for the shanks themselves, the decision is
easier: Buy center slices, about 1{ inches thick. Slices from the
narrow end have very little meat; those from the thick end contain
little or no marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Careful handling means slow cooking. After browning the shanks
and adding a liquid, cook them covered at a bare simmer. Use
kitchen tongs to turn them every 30 minutes or so, making sure each
side spends some time bathed in the flavorful cooking liquid that
becomes the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   OSSO BUCO
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 center-cut slices veal shank, 2 pounds or more
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 cloves garlic, lightly mashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine, chicken or beef stock, or water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons butter, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat for a couple
of minutes. Add the oil, swirl it around, and pour out any excess.
Add the veal slices and cook until nicely browned on the first
side, about 5 minutes. (For even browning, you can rotate the
slices, but try not to disturb them too much.) Turn and brown the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the second side is just about completely browned,
sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and add the garlic and
anchovies to the pan. Cook, stirring a little, until the anchovies
dissolve and the garlic browns, about 2 minutes. Add the liquid and
let it bubble away for about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn the heat to low and cover the skillet. Five minutes
later, check to see that the mixture is simmering _ just a few
bubbles appearing at once _ and adjust the heat accordingly. Cook
until the meat is very tender and pulling away from the bone, at
least 90 minutes and probably somewhat more; turn the slices every
half-hour or so. (When the meat is tender, you may turn off the
heat and refrigerate the dish for up to 24 hours; reheat gently
before proceeding.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the meat to a warm platter and turn the heat to high.
Boil the sauce until it becomes thick and glossy, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the butter if you like, and serve the meat with the sauce
spooned over it.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WINE OF THE WEEK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Primitivo Salento Cantele 1995, Italy. About $10. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just to uncomplicate things a bit, primitivo is the grape,
Salento is the region in southeastern Italy where it is grown, and
Cantele is the name of the family who grow it. For a while,
primitivo was a prime suspect in the mystery surrounding the origin
of the zinfandel grape. But then someone came along with a Croatian
grape that seemed even closer. Scientists now say it is unlikely
that either grape can claim parenthood. In any event, the
resemblance of this full, sturdy red to zinfandel is unmistakable.
Like a suspiciously high number of our California zinfandels, this
primitivo comes from vines 35 to 40 years old, which accounts for
its intensity. At $10, it is a good buy.

BOOKS THAT DON'T SHOW THEIR AGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine books, most of them, are like wine itself: if they are any
good at all, they hold up for a few years, then fade and are
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the bookstores, wine books are invariably displayed with the
cookbooks. Ah, but how different they are. There are good cooks
who, when asked the secret of their success, proudly brandish a
stained old tome, and insist that everything they know came from
Escoffier, Craig Claiborne or Julia Child. Wine books, though, are
like automobiles: they begin to depreciate almost before you've
brought them home. After all, the chapter on Bordeaux was written
six months earlier and based on material gathered six months before
that. And tasting notes in a book, like a railroad timetable, are
good for a limited time.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is a living thing. It improves, it declines, its aroma
changes, its color changes and so does its taste. A recipe for
lentil soup is forever; a comment on a wine is ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   So is it foolish to buy wine books? Not at all. The best of them
deal with what is lasting: wine in history, in society, in culture
_ its impact on our lives. They tell of the unforgettable people
who have fostered our wine culture _ or opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they are fun to read. Some of the best wine
writing is not in wine books _ it turns up regularly in the Bible,
for example. Closer to our own time, English writers from
Shakespeare to George Meredith and Evelyn Waugh wrote
entertainingly about wine.
</P>
<P>
   But wine in literature is not the same as wine literature. Is
there a body of work about wine that is well-written and lasting? I
think so, and I offer herewith a few examples. A few of these books
are out of print but a good bookseller should be able to find them
without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For my taste, a trio of British writers lead the list: Hugh
Johnson, Gerald Asher and Clive Coates. Johnson is best known for
his ``World Atlas of Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), first published in
1971 and now in its fourth edition, 1994, and ``Hugh Johnson's
Modern Encyclopedia of Wine,'' also in its fourth edition, 1998.
But his ``Vintage: The Story of Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1989),
originally published as a companion piece to a television series,
is equally impressive, and equally enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Asher is the wine columnist for Gourmet magazine. He qualifies
for this list because two volumes of his columns have been
published in book form: ``On Wine'' (Random House, 1986), and
``Vineyard Tales'' (Chronicle Press, 1996). Asher is one of the few
writers on wine whose timely pieces are a delight to read long
after they first appeared. He lives part of the year in California,
and some of his best articles are on the California wine scene.
</P>
<P>
   From London, Coates writes, edits and publishes a small, elegant
magazine called The Vine. Each issue deals with three or four wine
properties, usually in France; discusses various vintages, and
offers Coates' notes and impressions from tastings. A number of his
profiles of chateaus and Burgundy estates have been collected in
two magisterial volumes called, for Bordeaux, ``Grands Vins''
(1995), and, for Burgundy, ``Cote d'Or'' (1997), both from the
University of California Press. Coates is a superb historian. Even
someone only vaguely interested in wine will be riveted by his
in-depth histories of the vineyards and chateaus.
</P>
<P>
   Remington Norman's ``Great Domaines of Burgundy'' (Henry Holt,
1996) and ``Rhone Renaissance'' (Wine Appreciation Guild, 1996) are
large-format books, knowledgeably written and handsomely
illustrated. The Rhone book is particularly valuable because it
explains the cultivation of the region's grape varieties _ syrah,
grenache, mourvedre _ all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   One isn't likely to curl up before the fire with Jancis
Robinson's immense ``Oxford Companion to Wine'' (Oxford University
Press, 1994), but it is essential to even the smallest library of
wine books. On the other hand, her ``Vines, Grapes and Wine''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), about grape varieties around the world, is
a surprisingly good read.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, the Dutch writer Hubrecht Duijker has
turned out a series of first-class large-format books on wine, most
recently, in collaboration with Michael Broadbent, ``The Bordeaux
Atlas and Encyclopedia of Chateaux'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998).
This is mostly a reference book, but I find myself lingering over
an irresistible combination of geography and history.
</P>
<P>
   Just as some of the best writing on French wine is by a Dutch
writer, one of the finest books on American wine, ``Wine Atlas of
California'' (Viking, 1993), is by an Australian: James Halliday. I
hope he updates this book, because it is astonishingly thorough and
extremely attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Lichine's ``New Encyclopedia of Wine and Spirits''
(Alfred A. Knopf), revised in 1987, is becoming outdated. His
``Guide to the Wines and Vineyards of France,'' 1951, last revised
in 1986, is old-fashioned. But it is also a fascinating
autobiography of the man who taught France how to sell wine to
Americans and taught us how to drink it.

ACADEMICS ARGUE MERITS OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE IVORY TOWER

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hundreds of anonymous 18th-century articles and
letters have been attributed to the famed writer Daniel Defoe,
author of the adventure story ``Robinson Crusoe.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he really write all of them? To find out, literary
experts are using computers to analyze the disputed texts.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of many topics discussed this week at the San
Francisco conference of the Modern Language Association of America,
one of the biggest scholarly organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, literary scholars, English professors, French
teachers, linguistic theorists and other devotees of the printed
word have packed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them resemble tweedy profs. Rather, these hip new members
of the intelligentsia are holding panel discussions analyzing
language, imagery and symbolism in ways unimaginable a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are talking about the deeper meanings of videotaped
pornography and the growth of feminism on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the conference has been devoted to erudite discussions
not about printed books but, rather, about its supposed competitors
_ computing, television and the Internet. Ironically, many
conferees are discovering that these potential competitors can be
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The use of computers to study Defoe's writings was discussed
Monday in a session entitled ``Computer Methods in the Study of
Literature and Theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Joseph Rudman of the Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh detailed his and other scholars' efforts to use
computers to identify anonymous writings as Defoe's. The computer
scans texts for Defoe's literary fingerprints _ for example,
sentences of certain lengths.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that everyone will agree on the computer's
conclusions. Rudman noted that one scholar who uses a computer to
analyze Defoe texts has gotten into a ``slightly heated'' dispute
with a traditional scholar who doesn't rely on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the computer, the task (of analyzing Defoe) is very
difficult,'' Rudman said. ``Without the computer, the task is next
to impossible.''

LONGING FOR FOOD IN A WORLD OF CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As exhilarating as the fast-moving food world can be,
over the last few years it has felt to me increasingly like a car
careering out of control. Cooking trends have bombarded us from all
directions, cookbook sections in bookstores have grown into
multicolored labyrinths, restaurant dishes have become ordeals to
deconstruct _ both physically and sensually. And many home cooks
have followed these trends into the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   I remember going to a dinner party that included dishes from
nearly every continent. I left dazed and confused. It was just too
much.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this overload, I started retreating.
</P>
<P>
   At home, I find I'm now cooking straightforward traditional
dishes. When I go out, I gravitate toward restaurants like
Etats-Unis, Il Buco and Le Bernardin, whose chefs understand
restraint and simplicity. I have cravings for the clean, honest
flavors of sushi.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone. I have noticed a growing number of home cooks,
chefs and cookbook authors who seem to share my sentiment. In the
same way that many food professionals two decades ago tossed aside
overwrought French cooking to revel in the purity of nouvelle
cuisine, many are now pulling away from fusion cooking and
free-wheeling experimentation and heading for an entirely new ideal
_ simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   This growing respect for the pure and uncomplicated is looking
like an engine for a whole new movement in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inevitable,'' said Rozanne Gold, a food consultant and
cookbook author in Brooklyn who is known for her pared-down
approach to food. ``My feeling was we needed that kind of antidote
to the fussiness of the food in the '80s. Chefs could no longer
compete with the number of ingredients in a dish or how high it was
on a plate.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many shifts in the food world, this one was born in the
restaurant kitchen. A couple of years ago, a few chefs began
forgoing garnishes, cutting down on the number of ingredients and
focusing on techniques that coaxed the essential flavors from the
foods they used. The results are spare in appearance and impeccable
in flavor. Most important, they are easy for the palate to
comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   For chefs once absorbed by the idea of cooking with a
multiplicity of components, this has been an about-face. ``When we
used to do desserts at Montrachet,'' said Bill Yosses, who is now
the pastry chef at Bouley Bakery, ``our idea was contrast and
juxtapose. The big catchword was marriage of flavors, and who could
marry the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is who can marry the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened up Bouley Bakery,'' Yosses said, ``I thought it
would be great to focus on a more direct and powerful experience on
the plate. I wanted to limit what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, his acclaimed desserts can be as simple as a
supercreamy rice pudding or a rich chocolate tart. The ``zinger,''
as Yosses calls it, is not candied orange peel on the side of the
plate or a chocolate fork poking into the dessert, but the
intensity of flavor in the dessert itself. Chocolate is what makes
the chocolate tart memorable.
</P>
<P>
   And it is probably no coincidence that I can still recall a
decadent brioche pudding I had there three months ago, while all
those fusion feasts have become a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Colicchio, the chef at Gramercy Tavern, has also done a bit
of nipping and tucking in his cooking in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for me, anyway, it's a question of maturity,'' he
said. ``The older I get, I think less is more.'' Instead of adding
elements to a plate, he has started taking them off. Items like
``roasted farm chicken in consomme with black truffle'' at Gramercy
Tavern may seem blunt when compared with the grocery lists on many
restaurant menus.
</P>
<P>
   But what the chef is really telling diners is that they are
getting a perfectly roasted, high-quality chicken with two
accompaniments they can make sense of.
</P>
<P>
   It takes courage, though, to serve such unadorned food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people spend a lot of money in restaurants,'' said David
Rosengarten, the host of the ``Taste'' program on the Food Network,
``and it's easier to see the evidence of the money they've spent in
froufrou on the plate _ swirls, complexity, multiple garnishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Diners in search of those circuses may find themselves outraged
by chefs like Laurent Gras of Peacock Alley, who has served a slab
of pristine salmon on a white plate with zero garnishes and a gravy
boat of sauce bearnaise on the side, or an entree with all of two
ingredients: sea bass and salsify batons. These may seem
excessively spare, but we depend on chefs to take risks and shape
the way we eat.
</P>
<P>
   The changes they are making in their kitchens are starting to
trickle down to home cooks, not just through inspiration, but by
way of their cookbooks as well. Tomes with recipes that call for
foie gras and quail eggs and take three days to prepare are being
challenged by books by top chefs that are surprisingly accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Le Bernardin Cookbook: Four-Star Simplicity'' (Doubleday,
1998) by Eric Ripert and Maguy Le Coze: As long as you have a good
fish store nearby, you can count on achieving the pure, powerful
flavors of Ripert's cooking with little effort.
</P>
<P>
   More mainstream cookbooks are also responding to home cooks'
desire for clarity. Ms. Gold's books ``Recipes 1-2-3'' (Viking,
1996) and ``Recipes 1-2-3 Menu Cookbook'' (Little, Brown, 1998),
for instance, make the stripped-down approach even stricter by
limiting recipes to three ingredients or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Simplifying what we eat and how we cook is being done in other
ways, too. Some cookbook authors have taken a more definitive
approach, answering a question that plagues all home cooks: Which
is the best recipe for a well-known dish? They are moving away from
presenting their version, or a version, and are declaring the
version.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many cookbooks in almost any given area that
there is confusion on the part of consumers as to which is the most
authentic, authoritative voice,'' said Jennifer Josephy, a cookbook
editor at Little, Brown &AMP; Co. ``They don't want to try five
different recipes and see which is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, cooks want one recipe that they know is going to
be great. It needn't be something original: They want a basic
repertory of things that really shine.

 EAGLE ROCK, Va.: ... all, Shakespeare.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young Donald told himself that the great minds of the world
didn't see color. He believed that if he offered the world his
colorblind gifts, then the world would toss colorblind appreciation
back at him. His aunt Helen told him he possessed ``a beautiful
naivete.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 Donald Anderson boarded a bus _ had to walk to the back
and take his seat _ for Ann Arbor and enrolled at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   What few black kids there were on the Ann Arbor campus tended to
knot together. It gave them a sense of security. Donald Anderson
kept his distance. He didn't want to be grouped with any particular
clique. Some blacks thought him strange.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year Anderson was talking to a professor about
transportation economics, which fascinated him. He was thinking of
graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't teach transportation economics right in America,''
the professor told Anderson. ``You should go to to London and study
at the London School of Economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson smiled. Such beautiful instruction, he thought, such
colorblind guidance.
</P>
<P>
   London would have to wait until Anderson finished a two-year
Army stint, but when he set foot in the ancient city in 1955, he
swooned. He made his first friends there, and of course there was
the Bard _ the Old Vic was right across the road from the London
School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   After London he returned to Ann Arbor to attend the University
of Michigan Law School. By 1960 he would hold two degrees from
Michigan and one from the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, he was loaded. He waited for the offers to come in
from the blue-chip law firms. None came. He found a job in
Pittsburgh, clerking for a judge. But he soon grew bored.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned the name Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the New York
congressman, and told Anderson that Powell was always looking for
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson sent a query letter to Powell. He was invited in for an
interview. Maxine Dargans, Powell's chief clerk, knew the applicant
was white _ the rich credentials, America 1962 _ and she raised her
head with the arrival of every white man into the office. Donald
Anderson arrived. The revelation was too rich. Powell hired him on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of 1962 was a wonderful time to be in Washington,
and downright intoxicating to be on Powell's staff. After having
languished in Congress for years, Powell was now chairman of both
education and labor committees.
</P>
<P>
   Following Kennedy's death, the anti-poverty machine roared.
There were momentous victories. But there were troubles. Powell was
investigated for overspending committee funds and for refusing to
settle a slander lawsuit from a woman in Harlem. In 1966 Powell was
refused his seat. He would return to Congress in 1968, but minus
the power. His last term in office, 1968-1970, was sad: humming
gospel tunes, missing votes, sick with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Anderson left Washington. Like so many, he had first been
dazzled, then disillusioned. He'd always thought politicians had
too much power over poverty programs. He started dreaming. About
Thomas Jefferson, about the British Parliamentary system, fashioned
to respect order and process. He started dreaming about all the
poor faces he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an epiphany,'' recalls Wyche Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson told his parents. They listened, but didn't hear. But
when they heard, they were aghast. Russell Anderson didn't sleep
outside so his son could gallivant around the country, some sort of
savior for the poor. Celeste Anderson's treasured son couldn't
vanish into a web of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He needed seed money. He looked across the Virginia countryside.
A lot of folk looked at him and rolled their eyes, closed their
doors. But a Virginia farmer who had made a mark in local politics
listened _ and helped. ``A most unusual Christian,'' is how
Anderson describes Edwin Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in race relations,'' says Lynch,
now a retired Virginia landowner. ``He wasn't happy with the
federal government,'' Lynch recalls about Anderson. ``He thought he
had a system that could work better.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has taken his Assembly into North Carolina and South
Carolina. He's glided into Alabama. He's convinced those whose
faith had lapsed in small towns in Georgia to pull out chairs and
invite him to sit down and listen.
</P>
<P>
   His reception, however, can vary from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he'd walk into a room and it wouldn't be long before
he'd realize that his critics were already there, were, in fact,
the very people sitting around the table awaiting his pitch _ some
with white faces, some with black faces. He'd start pulling out the
forms, the Assembly literature. He'd start talking about C.C.
Pettaway, about the Surry school district and the high test scores
of the children. Those around the table would listen. They'd nod.
And then the inquisition would begin. They'd want to know what it
was he was really selling. They'd want to know what political
office he was after. They'd want to know just where he would be
when the drought came, because he sounded like a farm-belt
evangelist, promising rain, and they didn't believe in rain
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson couldn't understand why everyone didn't see the wonder,
the beauty of it all _ communities full of rural folk who had
started rumbling. He knew some mighty fine poetry, and yet, he
couldn't find the words to properly explain the joy on C.C.
Pettaway's face when Pettaway saw his community rise up _ without a
rifle shot being fired as had happened in so many other Southern
rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   His dream has, at times, bumped headlong into reality _ money
has often been short. But then last year Donald Anderson caught a
second wind. Some new foundation money flowed in. He got that
little beautific smile on his face again. He told his staff, now up
to 14 full-timers, it was time to turn north, to take on urban
American and the very symbol of urban disarray: the nation's
capital. And also time to burrow to the very bottom of the South,
to that one place that has long befuddled anti-poverty workers and
haunted him and the family of slaves he sleeps near every night. He
told himself that it was time to go to Mississippi because if he
couldn't make peace with Mississippi, he wondered if he could keep
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi is a lot like Virginia was 30 years ago,'' Donald
Anderson says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Different, sure enough' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claude King is Don Anderson's man in Mississippi, and Don
Anderson's man in Mississippi is two hours into a drive, zooming
out from Jackson into the delta, going to meet some Assembly folks.
</P>
<P>
   King's been around Mississippi for years. Before Mississippi he
rolled around other parts of the South, doing anti-poverty work,
holding on until the money ran out, packing up when a program
folded.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Claude King's feet are covered in lizard cowboy
boots. His tummy's a huge and wide thing. ``Maann

 NEW YORK: really shine.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was writing ``The Perfect Recipe'' (Houghton Mifflin,
1998), Pam Anderson tested dozens of variations of dishes like
macaroni and cheese, chicken pot pie and lobster salad until she
developed recipes she considered the very best. Her recipes will
not change your life, but the book gives you confidence that they
will work and you will not be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Anderson's recipes are of the down-home variety,
the techniques are not always conventional. For macaroni and
cheese, for instance, she calls for stirring the mixture every five
minutes while it is baking. This, she says, gives it the ideal
balance of lightness and creaminess _ a detail that is missing from
most macaroni and cheese recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengarten's latest book, ``Taste'' (Random House, 1998), takes
a similar tack as he explores an eclectic mix of traditional and
trendy dishes from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a section on moussaka, he lays out the problems he has found
with most versions and highlights the ``criteria for quality'' to
help the reader tell a good one from a bad one. Then he offers a
recipe he calls ``the lightest, least oily, least tomatoey, most
eggplanty, most refined moussaka that you've ever tasted.'' Isn't
that just what you want as you plan a dinner party? Rosengarten
writes with bravado, but he certainly persuaded me to try his
recipe. And it delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooking is also influenced by food magazines. And even they
are devoting energy to sorting the glut of information in the food
world.
</P>
<P>
   You can read a new spirit in the definitive cover lines. ``True
Bagels,'' offered the November issue of Saveur; ``Perfect Beef
Tenderloin,'' promised Cook's Illustrated for November-December.
Instead of ``unforgettable'' and ``festive,'' the lures are now
``authentic,'' ``perfect'' and ``best.''
</P>
<P>
   In many magazines, the recipes themselves are moving toward
restraint. A recent Cook's Illustrated, for instance, did not claim
that ``the best lemon bars'' had a revolutionary twist or culinary
acrobatics: They simply promised to be traditional lemon bars from
a perfected recipe. Readers were made to feel they could trust it.
</P>
<P>
   So what do all these signs mean? That chefs are maturing and
that cookbooks and magazines are offering more substance and less
fluff? I hope so.
</P>
<P>
   Will chefs who fail to prune their creativity fall off the map?
Will cookbooks that lack authority sit on the shelves? Will the
food world ever be one cohesive, organized unit? Certainly not.
Cooking is an art, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems clear that among the forward-looking, the brash,
over-the-top '90s style of cooking may be simmering down. And a
pared-down approach to cooking and eating does seem a logical
progression.
</P>
<P>
   And I, for one, am ready to embrace it.

<P>
   6 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes in tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   \ cup parsley, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ground lamb
</P>
<P>
   { cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 pinches freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hot, scalded milk
</P>
<P>
   White pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated kefalotyri cheese or pecorino-Romano.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prick eggplants several times
with a fork. Rub a little olive oil into their skins. On a large
baking sheet, roast eggplants until soft, about 30 minutes, turning
frequently. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut into {-inch-thick
round slices.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over high heat
and brown eggplant slices lightly on each side. Do this in batches,
adding more oil as necessary. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle
with salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make tomato sauce: In a saucepan heat 1 tablespoon olive oil
over medium heat. Add 1 chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves,
and saute until tender. Add tomatoes and their puree, squeezing
them into coarse chunks. Add parsley, oregano, cinnamon and
vinegar. Stir well. Simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare lamb: In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive
oil over medium-high heat. Add remaining onions and garlic. Saute
for 5 minutes. Add lamb, in stages if necessary, and brown well,
breaking up pieces with a wooden spoon. Add wine and bring to a
boil. Cook until wine has nearly evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   5. Season lamb with salt, black pepper and 2 pinches of nutmeg.
Stir in 1 cup of reserved tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   6. Prepare bechamel: In a large saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of
butter over medium-low heat, and gradually whisk in flour. Cook for
2 minutes, whisking constantly. Do not let this brown. Add hot milk
and whisk rapidly to combine. Bring to a slow boil, whisking
constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring
frequently, until smooth and thickened. Season with salt, white
pepper and remaining 2 pinches nutmeg. Let cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   7. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and whisk in a spoonful of
bechamel. Whisk in remaining bechamel in a thin stream, and adjust
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   8. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Assemble moussaka: Sprinkle 2
tablespoons of bread crumbs across the bottom of a large baking
dish (18-by-8-by-3 inches) and cover crumbs evenly with half the
eggplant slices. Drain as much oil from lamb mixture as possible,
and spread the meat over the eggplant layer. Top meat with half the
cheese, then with half the remaining bread crumbs. Place remaining
eggplant slices on top of the bread crumbs, then add the bechamel,
remaining cheese and remaining bread crumbs in even layers. Dot
with remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   9. Bake for 45 minutes, until well browned. Remove from oven and
let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Cut into 3-inch squares to
serve. Serve with the extra tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 15 servings.

ORACLE'S ELLISON WINS DEADLY RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sailing novice and Silicon Valley software titan
Larry Ellison cruised to victory in Australia's deadly
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race but said if it had been his first race
he'd never sail again.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities recovered the bodies of four sailors and gave up
hope Tuesday of finding two others after a monstrous storm
decimated the race with 90-mph winds and 35-foot swells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sailing right through the eye of a hurricane,''
Ellison, owner and skipper of the 78-foot yacht Sayonara, said at a
somber post-race news conference in Hobart.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, CEO of Redwood City-based Oracle Corp., escaped heavy
winds and seas that sank or crippled 59 of the 115 boats entered in
the race _ the worst tragedy in the contest's 54-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was my first race, I would not have gone back to
sea,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   With media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan on board,
Sayonara crossed the line Tuesday, several hours ahead of defending
champion Brindabella, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to pay tribute to families who lost sailors who
were in this race, and our prayers go out to the search crews and
the people who are still in the water,'' Ellison said when Sayonara
was officially declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sayonara, which rode a southwesterly wind change
to finish at close to 10 knots, finished about five hours outside
the 1996 race record of the Morning Glory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a low-key victory with few spectator boats in Hobart to
greet the Sayonara after massive storms on Sunday devastated the
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's gale raked the fleet of 115 competing in the
630-nautical-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   The storms sent 27 Australian Navy ships scouring the seas for
survivors after the first call of ``Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!'' came
over shipboard radios Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two Australian sailors were killed when their 40-foot boat,
Business Post Naiad, capsized 60 miles off the New South Wales town
of Merimbula: skipper Bruce Guy and crew member Phil Skeggs. Guy
had an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's two rollovers
and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to release his safety
harness.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies were left on the abandoned boat by the other
crewmen, but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Three crew members from the stricken Winston Churchill _ Jim
Lawler, Mike Bannister and John Dean, all from Sydney _ were washed
out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Six other crewmen were rescued, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the bodies recovered are believed to be those of Winston
Churchill crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things got extremely dangerous,'' Ellison said in Hobart.
``Guys were knocked down time and time again and kept getting up
and kept getting back to work to do what was needed to be done to
keep the boat in one piece and keep all of us alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind made sounds I have never heard before,'' Ellison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sailors were injured _ with broken bones, dislocated
shoulders, cuts on the face and hands _ from being struck by broken
rigging or tossed upside down when their boats capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's former sailing tutor, San Francisco Yacht Club skipper
Paul Cayard, expressed praise, sadness and sharp criticism for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough race every year,'' said Cayard, who skippered the
54-foot yacht Jubilation through the 1987 Sydney-to-Hobart race.
``This year, obviously, they've had a really bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 50-knot southerly winds cutting across opposing heavy
currents during the opening days of the race created some of yacht
racing's most hazardous seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that every year,'' said Cayard, skipper of
AmericaOne, the St. Francis Yacht Club's entry at the 1999 New
Zealand challenge for the prestigious America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard was particularly saddened to hear of the loss of fellow
yacht racer Glyn Charles, who was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Australian rescue officials on Tuesday called off the search for
Charles, still missing along with one of the Winston Churchill's
crew members after storms overwhelmed the race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really sad thing,'' said Cayard. ``But it's something
that you have to learn to accept when you're in this line of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said he wasn't surprised to learn of Ellison's victory in
the 80-foot Sayonara, a custom-designed racing yacht.
</P>
<P>
   The average size of a boat in the race is 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest boat in the fleet,'' said Cayard. ``It's like
a 500-horsepower car beating a 200-horsepower car.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said Ellison's crew also gave him an edge in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done `round-the-world races,'' said Cayard. ``They
know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard helped Ellison first learn about sailing when the
software mogul bought the Sayonara in 1995 and skippered the boat
during several trans-oceanic races.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big for a beginner,'' said Cayard. ``But he can afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Ellison rate as a sailor?
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said he always tries to tread a fine line between running
a boat and letting the well-to-do owners ``feel like they're in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, Cayard said, was ``somewhere in the middle'' between
boat owners who want to run things immediately, and those who are
shy about taking the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't overbearing,'' said Cayard. ``Now he's knowledgeable
and involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard was critical of some racers in this year's Australian
race, saying the desire for speed is edging out the safety factor
in sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is most of the fleet is not prepared to encounter
(Sydney-to-Hobart) conditions,'' said Cayard. ``Most are built like
Formula One racers, to go around the buoys during a day race. It's
very typical. And we were all asking for something like this to
happen.''

PROTECTING PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As 1998 winds to a close (finally!), many in the
online world are sounding an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Web continues to grow, reaching into the lives of millions
of people, becoming a part of everyday life and emerging as a
trusted medium of communication _ everything from simple e-mail to
delicate financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, that's good. The more people online, the more
useful the Web becomes. And the more people embrace computers and
online communication, the more benefits we all enjoy _ everything
from secure online banking to lively forums on our favorite topics.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the booming online economy has sparked a mad
dash for cash _ money to be earned from anybody and everybody who
goes online. And the money can be made whether or not you've given
a Web site your Visa card number.
</P>
<P>
   How? By selling your information _ your age, your browsing
habits, the advertisements you choose to click on, your hometown
and any other tidbit Web sites can glean from you as your
electronic path crosses their contest entry forms and other tricks
they use to get you to enter personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Online ``cookies,'' nuggets of information Web sites store on
your hard drive, remain as useful to the individual surfer as to
the originating Web site. But cookies, combined with ``data
mining,'' the ability of highly technical software tools to dive
into oceans of seemingly unrelated data and emerge with trends that
can be used to make money, are making the information brokering
business a lucrative one.
</P>
<P>
   Millions, if not billions, of dollars are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   All this has renewed interest and concern over online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites make money by luring as many people as possible
through their electronic doors.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites, especially heavy-hitters such as Yahoo! or
America Online, try to convince the surfing public to begin each
online venture using specific online ``portals,'' or home pages.
They do this by offering free e-mail and the ability to customize
the portal to suit individual desires when it comes to news, sports
and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Once surfers have entered all of their information into the
appropriate online form, they are treated to a more personalized
and somewhat friendlier online experience.
</P>
<P>
   But what's to keep the Web site that just collected all that
data from turning around and selling it?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Although many major Web sites have taken great pains to protect
the privacy of their users, many others continue to operate with
little or no regard to individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired News'' recently concluded that despite repeated warnings
from federal regulators, the online community has done a poor job
regulating itself when it comes to protecting the privacy of
individual users.
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 22 perspective piece, James Glave of ``Wired News''
indicated that federally imposed consumer privacy protection laws
might be the answer:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Trust us,'' say the Internet lobbyists fighting such laws
under the self-regulation lobby,'' Glave wrote. ``But why should
you? You have no more control over information kept about you than
you did a year and a half ago, when leaders of the Web first stood
up in Federal Trade Commission hearings and argued against laws
that would empower end users.''
</P>
<P>
   The dawning of 1999 may, in fact, bring some type of federal
regulation of online privacy unless self-regulating efforts, such
as TrustE, an industry coalition that hands out ``privacy seals of
approval'' to deserving Web sites, are able to make some
significant headway.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, individual users can do a few things to protect
themselves:
</P>
<P>
   - When using Web sites that require personal information, first
look and see whether they have a posted policy on privacy. If they
do, read it. Make sure you don't need to check a box somewhere or
send someone e-mail to keep them from selling your data. If they
don't have a privacy policy, take your business somewhere else!
</P>
<P>
   - Even if a Web site offers a great privacy policy, think twice
before filling out contest entry forms or other methods of online
registration. Do you really value what you will get in return for
giving up your personal data?
</P>
<P>
   - When faced with an online registration form of any sort, don't
just blindly fill in all the blanks. Often, only certain fields are
required, such as your e-mail address. Many other fields, such as
your annual household income, your age, etc., could be optional.
You can protect some of your privacy by not filling in the optional
fields.
</P>
<P>
   - Like to participate in online forums? No problem with that.
But be cautious about the personal facts you sprinkle throughout
your missives. Messages posted to public forums take on lives of
their own, and personal details you've revealed can be collected
and used by anybody.
</P>
<P>
   - Read more about online privacy and, if you oversee a Web site,
develop your own privacy policy by visiting TrustE's Web site at
www.truste.org/ or the Web site of the Online Privacy Alliance at
www.privacyalliance.org/.
</P>
<P>
   - Want to become more active in protecting online privacy? Check
out the Privacy Watchdog, a new Web site and service created by the
Center for Democracy and Technology. The site, at
watchdog.cdt.org/, is aimed at halting the abuse of online cookies.
It encourages individual Web surfers to participate by rating Web
sites of their choice when it comes to privacy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOME SERVER NEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers of this column know that I like to rant about
the need for home networks _ systems linked to a home server that
can run electronic appliances throughout the home.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of such home networks exist, but I've yet to see anybody
get serious about making it work in a cost-effective and realistic
fashion. We need, for example, computer terminals designed for the
space where they are to be used, like small, easily cleaned models
for the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though 1999 will bring us closer to that reality.
</P>
<P>
   First off, industry insiders say the coming year will see the
first products released that meet the so-called ``HAVI'' standards.
HAVI, which stands for Home Audio Video Interoperability, allows
companies to make devices that all can ``talk'' to each other.
</P>
<P>
   A simple example of HAVI's usefulness: You download the latest
album from your favorite musical group from a Web site, but instead
of just saving it to your computer's hard drive, you pass it on for
immediate use to the stereo in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, Matsushita, Hitachi, Toshiba, Sharp, Thompson and Philips
are expected to release the first HAVI devices over the next 12
months. Whether they'll be cheap enough to purchase, I'm not sure.
But this is a step in the right direction!
</P>
<P>
   Another home server development: CEOs are beginning to speak
openly about the home server market and the fact that the
development of such a market will play a key role in maintaining
strong sales of PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This news has surfaced from a variety of sources, including
``Fortune'' magazine's David Kirkpatrick, who managed to speak to
five CEOs at the recent COMDEX computer trade show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway CEO Ted Waitt and Sony Electronics President Teruaki
Aoki both told Kirkpatrick that home PCs would become servers
capable of running a variety of appliances throughout the home.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki went so far as to say that the home server concept is one
of the reasons Sony entered the PC business.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see where the home server idea stands
come this time next year.  &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S DOSE OF HUMOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I remember back in my school days reading books about
``pioneers.'' Typically, these were folks who did things like
crossing America in covered wagons 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet and the fast pace of computers, we are
now seeing the word ``pioneer'' used with a bit more abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A recent press release from the public relations
staff behind iPrint.com, an online print shop at www.iprint.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``iPrint.com pioneered the concept of the online print shop back
in early 1997,'' the press release stated.
</P>
<P>
   Good god! Early 1997? That was a loooong time ago! Was Arizona
even a state back then?
</P>
<P>
   Ha!
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's it for this week (and 1998)! Happy computing, and
have a great New Year! &QL;

BLIND GRADUATE STEPS INTO MICROSOFT'S WORLD  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Loren Mikola is asking friends with good fashion sense
to put little tags on his clothes so he won't look goofy on on his
first day of work at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He's also brushing up on his cooking skills because, at the age
of 24, he's moving out of his parents' Glendale, Ariz., house.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also have to learn to navigate the public bus system in
Microsoft's hometown of Redmond, Wash., because it's probably best
he doesn't drive.
</P>
<P>
   Mikola is blind but has managed to use Braille books and quick
wits to graduate with honors from Arizona State University College
of Business in Tempe, Ariz., and land a $44,000 job with the
nation's leading software firm.
</P>
<P>
   His family members cheered earlier this month as he received his
bachelor's degree in computer information systems.
</P>
<P>
   When Mikola initiated his job search in August, he feared the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I would have a difficult time finding a job
because no matter what everybody says there's discrimination out
there,'' Mikola said. ``So I really feel fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mikola began handing out resumes during on-campus job fairs,
he only stopped at Microsoft's booth because his friend did. He
even told the representative that he wasn't interested in leaving
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   So Mikola was surprised when Microsoft requested an interview.
When they met, the recruiter only asked two questions. One was,
``how would you design a toaster?''
</P>
<P>
   Mikola was even more surprised when Bill Gates' company flew him
to Redmond where he sat through five hours of interviews. They
asked, ``how would you design a stapler?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they'd give me an offer,'' Mikola said.
</P>
<P>
   But they did.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it's not that un usual for them to hire people
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft looks for people that are smart and that's our first
priority,'' spokeswoman Beth Brainard said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mikola is ``an incredible asset'' because he can offer his
perspective on whether Microsoft's products to assist the blind
work well, Brainard said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikola also received a competitive offer from Andersen
Consulting. The job involved extensive travel and overtime, factors
that led him to turn them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what it means for me to have an offer from
them, too, because they were able to make me an offer and look past
my disability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Redmond won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mikola is up to the task, armed with a can-do attitude his
family has impressed upon him for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was born, to me, he could see. And that's how I raised
him,'' said his mother, Judy Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   Since boyhood, Mikola has gone fishing, camping and to the
movies just like his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-pound stripped bass he caught while on a fishing trip hangs
on his bedroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   He attended regular public schools where he also took special
classes to learn Braille. He graduated valedictorian from his high
school in Michigan, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He attended a junior college in a suburb of Detroit until his
family moved to Glendale, in part so that Mikola could begin
studying at ASU in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his first unassisted day on ASU's sprawling, crowded
campus, Mikola laughs and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   He missed his turns and got lost among the university's 50,000
hurried students.
</P>
<P>
   In time he learned to make his way.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting Professor Paul Steinbart remembers Mikola as a
bright, friendly student who was quick to offer an answer in class.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from preparing tests early so that Mikola could take them
orally, Steinbart made few accommodations for Mikola.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really almost forgot that he was blind,'' Steinbart said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikola uses a handful of tools that help him live a relatively
normal life. He has a cane, uses a tape recorder rather than taking
notes in class and has textbooks made into Braille.
</P>
<P>
   At home he has a Braille terminal attached to his computer. Its
a long rectangular board with pins that gently raise up to
translate the words on the monitor into Braille. Also, he has a
speech synthesizer that can read the words on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   He's loved computers ever first started playing on them at age
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like seeing people and technology working together,'' he
said. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A small display at 255 Elizabeth St. (Houston
Street), the new retail outlet of Wild Edibles, the seafood
wholesaler, only hints at how much seafood there is for sale. A
chalkboard inside the storefront lists all the other sea fare
sequestered in the chilly back room.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect bargains. The company was founded six years ago by
Jonathan Meyer and Richard Martin to serve restaurants. It offers
reliably high-quality seafood, domestic and imported, at prices a
trifle lower than those at Dean &AMP; DeLuca nearby or at some uptown
seafood stores.
</P>
<P>
   For example, blackfish and Atlantic salmon fillets are $10.95 a
pound, and whole skate and monkfish on the bone are $4.95 a pound.
Sea scallops are $16.95 a pound, but they are the genuine Maine
diver's kind. The market has 12 varieties of oysters for New Year's
Eve, $1.10 to $1.40 each.
</P>
<P>
   The impeccable quality is up to top restaurant standards, and
the fish is iced and handled well. The service is equally fine. Pin
bones are plucked out of salmon fillets, and sea urchins ($5.95
each) are cleaned for you. The store can also provide cooking tips.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to call to see what's available, or to order. The
retail hours Monday through Friday are noon to 7 p.m.; Saturday, 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Telephone: (212)
625-9971.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate and Friends
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you think a chocolate cherry is merely a whole
cherry in white goo encased in chocolate, think again. There are
other ways to combine the two symbiotic flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Designs, a wine-theme mail-order company in Ventura,
Calif., has dried cherries that have been soaked in pinot noir,
covered in magenta-tinted milk chocolate and packed in a pretty
tin. They are $16.95, plus $5.95 shipping, and can be ordered at
(888) 987-5700. Similar dried cherries enrobed in chocolate but
without the wine bath and with artificial coloring, are also sold
at Starbucks, $2.99 for 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Petrossian's tin of shiny coffee-bean-size chocolate candies,
each filled with a potent little mouthful of cherry brandy, is $40
for 12 ounces at the Petrossian boutique, 182 West 58th St. They
can also be ordered for delivery, $10 extra, at (800) 828-9241.
</P>
<P>
   Cut-Rate Catering
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Karen Lee, a caterer who specializes in Chinese
cooking but who also prepares Mediterranean and fusion menus, may
not lack for customers this week, but with an eye to the future,
she is offering a discount on all parties that are given from Jan.
4 to Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For events with 20 guests or fewer, the price reduction is 10
percent; it goes up to 20 percent for larger parties. Ms. Lee's
prices for a cocktail party range from $31 to $55 a person,
depending on the number of guests. For a sit-down dinner, the cost
ranges from $70 to $135 a person. Those prices do not include chefs
and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Also on sale for a week starting Monday are selections from the
market table at Flavors, 8 West 18th St. Pamela Morgan, the owner,
is celebrating her fifth anniversary by reducing the price for
salads, grain dishes and other fare on the buffet to $5 a pound
from $7.50.

MEXICO ASSEMBLY PLANTS ABUSE WOMEN'S RIGHTS, SAYS U.S. GROUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Top international companies running
``maquiladora'' factories along Mexico's border with the United
States are flouting Mexican and international law by forcing women
to undergo pregnancy tests as a condition of employment, Human
Rights Watch said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A host of companies require female job applicants to produce
urine samples to be used for pregnancy tests, while some have
company doctors and nurses examine the applicants or ask for
confidential information concerning their contraceptive practices,
the New York-based organization added.
</P>
<P>
   Women found to be pregnant are refused employment, the group
said in a report on the discrimination allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is flagrant sex discrimination that these corporations
would never dare to defend or practice in their own countries,''
said Regan Ralph, executive director of Human Rights Watch's
Women's Rights Division. ``The Mexican government has abandoned
women workers to the discriminatory employment practices of
``maquiladora`` operators. Women are left having to choose between
a job and their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the cases of 53 women who reported discrimination in the
cities of Ciudad Juarez, Reynosa, Rio Bravo and Tijuana, the report
said some companies required women to take pregnancy tests after
being hired and claimed a few even forced female employees to
produce evidence of menstruation to prove they were not pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies carrying out the tests are Landis &AMP; Staefa,
Samsung Group, Matsushita Electric Corp., Sunbeam-Oster, Sanyo,
Thomson Corporate Worldwide, Siemens AG, Lear, Johnson Controls,
Tyco International and Pacific Dunlop, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch criticized the legal recourses available to
affected employees and called on the Mexican government to do more
to protect its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said the Mexican government claims that
pre-employment pregnancy testing does not contravene its laws
because its legislation covers job holders, not job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that interpretation, Ralph said: ``When corporations
say that this discrimination is permissible under Mexican labor
law, they are in fact hiding behind Mexico's own negligence. The
Mexican government's defense is weak and phony. It is
reinterpreting Mexican law to suit its case.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Mexico's Commerce and Industry Ministry, the
government branch that oversees the ``maquiladora'' industry, did
not return telephone calls, and representatives of the companies
cited could not be reached for comment.

ENDING A CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only one more year to go and we can wrap up an
astonishingly tumultuous, revolutionary century with a whimper, a
bang, a cheer or a sigh of relief, depending on the point of view.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in 1999, the 20th century has already
recorded two world wars; the Vietnam war; the start of the nuclear
age; the exploration of space; massive industrialization;
inventions that have transformed communications, transportation and
everyday life; the emancipation of women; the rise of civil rights;
unprecedented prosperity as well as a crushing Depression, and a
steadily spreading cynicism about national leaders and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon's resignation to avoid House impeachment and
President Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate are political
milestones with inevitable psychological impact. But they are not
as profoundly important in the course of human events as the great
shifts of philosophy, politics, technology and power that have
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that 1999 is merely a leftover year to kill,
unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps it will be the
equivalent of my grandmother sitting on her farmhouse porch
watching the corn grow. But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, in 1899, not a lot occurred to indicate
what a dramatically different era was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The first magnetic recording of sound only hinted at the
potential for world-wide communication. Theodore Dreiser published
his first novel, Sister Carrie, about a disgraced woman with a will
to survive. It was not a critical or commercial success but later
came to be viewed as capturing the emerging spiritual emptiness in
a materialistic society.
</P>
<P>
   The big political event of 1899 did not seem so significant at
the time. President William McKinley's vice president, Garret
Hobart, died, thus leaving a vacancy for McKinley to fill when he
ran for re-election in 1900. The popular governor of New York and
hero of the Spanish-American war, Theodore Roosevelt, was easily
nominated as Hobart's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   When a newly re-elected McKinley was assassinated by an
anarchist in 1901, Roosevelt was propelled into the White House,
where he became one of our most respected presidents. As the first
chief executive in tune with the changing times, Roosevelt battled
corporate monopolies, demanded conservation of American parkland
and fought for new consumer protections like the Food and Drug Act
and employers' liability laws.
</P>
<P>
   There may be few clues to the next century from the 12 months of
1999 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will be in a holding pattern, doing little. The Clinton
impeachment drama will consume the White House and Senate until a
trial is completed or detoured into a censure path. After that,
exhaustion and the political calendar will take over. Congressional
maneuvering for re-election in a polarized atmosphere will prevent
substantive action on anything.
</P>
<P>
   As for the House, it is now so tarnished as partisan and
unreasoning that, like Humpty Dumpty, it cannot be put together in
its present shape. New political eggs, fresh from the 2000
election, will be required before it can function usefully again.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this century, forget progress on Social Security
and Medicare financing. Forget education reform. Forget campaign
finance reform. Not even re-naming an airport for the Virgin Mary
could win approval before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   This year is also likely to be as clueless about international
relations in the next century as 1899 was about the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Already we have gone from the Cold War terror of nuclear
disaster to an era of harassment by minor rogue nations that cannot
compete with our global power but can generate chaos, brutalize
their neighbors and threaten American lives. Where this leads us
depends on the ability of evil forces to carry out their sinister
intentions, the diplomatic skills and wisdom of the peaceful
international community and the growing strength or weakness of
democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Iraq and the continuing tensions there represent
a dangerous situation but not necessarily a permanent one. The
Middle East is a muddle as always, but progress has been made
against incredible political odds and the process continues. The
Soviet Union is kaput, a ruin of its former self. The seeds of
trouble are there but with luck and care they need not germinate.
</P>
<P>
   The new year will be a transitional period, cleaning up the
Clinton crisis and preparing for the presidential election that
will dominate the first year of the next century. Will we get lucky
and pick another Teddy Roosevelt? Let us hope.

   Y2K-COLUMN _ ``I'm OK, euro OK,'' reads the motto on a T-shirt
distributed by Netherlands-based banking giant ABN Amro. But a lot
of people are keeping their fingers crossed. The first swarm of
euro conversions, a near-relation to the millennium bug, will
arrive Jan. 4. Many analysts believe the euro changeover will
provide an unpalatable foretaste of Y2K. (Chambers, Atlanta

   SCIENTIFICATLANTA _ ATLANTA _ A lanky 58, James McDonald looks
the long distance runner and, at least in how he's run
Scientific-Atlanta, he is. As president and chief executive,
McDonald has pushed this maker of television equipment to chase the
promise of digital interactive TV that glimmers on a distant

<P>
   LATE-FLIGHT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Of all the flights to all
the airports across America, Delta's late-night hop from Atlanta to
West Palm Beach distinguished itself in the most irritating way.
First, it made the federal Department of Transportation's List of
Shame, which ranks domestic flights that arrive late more than 80
percent of the time. It finished 1997 with the very worst on-time
record of any flight by the 10 major airlines required to file
reports. Then The Wall Street Journal _ factoring in crowding,
breakdowns, stomach-churning snacks and other miseries of the skies
_ pronounced it one of the 5 Worst Flights in America. How bad can
any less-than-two-hour flight be? Climbing aboard was the only way
to find out. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   MONEYTALK-COLUMN _ Post-holiday letdown gives a lot of people
the blahs. But it can also be a breather and a time to look ahead.
Most of us have some time off this week, or at least a slack period
at work. Most of us have been partying, spending and generally
going at warp speed for weeks now. And almost all of us suffer from
nagging suspicions that things have gotten complicated, expensive
and a little bit out of control. One way to recover is to try to
get a grip on your financial life. With a little organization and
effort, you can begin to recoup some feeling of control over your
financial life. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

of people are keeping their fingers crossed. The first swarm of
euro conversions, a near-relation to the millennium bug, will
arrive Jan. 4. Many analysts believe the euro changeover will
provide an unpalatable foretaste of Y2K. (Chambers, Atlanta

   SCIENTIFICATLANTA _ ATLANTA _ A lanky 58, James McDonald looks
the long distance runner and, at least in how he's run

McDonald has pushed this maker of television equipment to chase the
promise of digital interactive TV that glimmers on a distant
horizon. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   LATE-FLIGHT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Of all the flights to all
the airports across America, Delta's late-night hop from Atlanta to
West Palm Beach distinguished itself in the most irritating way.
First, it made the federal Department of Transportation's List of
Shame, which ranks domestic flights that arrive late more than 80
percent of the time. It finished 1997 with the very worst on-time
record of any flight by the 10 major airlines required to file
reports. Then The Wall Street Journal _ factoring in crowding,
breakdowns, stomach-churning snacks and other miseries of the skies
_ pronounced it one of the 5 Worst Flights in America. How bad can
any less-than-two-hour flight be? Climbing aboard was the only way
to find out. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   MONEYTALK-COLUMN _ Post-holiday letdown gives a lot of people
the blahs. But it can also be a breather and a time to look ahead.
Most of us have some time off this week, or at least a slack period
at work. Most of us have been partying, spending and generally
going at warp speed for weeks now. And almost all of us suffer from
nagging suspicions that things have gotten complicated, expensive
and a little bit out of control. One way to recover is to try to
get a grip on your financial life. With a little organization and
effort, you can begin to recoup some feeling of control over your
financial life. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

For every great thrill, there was an eerie chill about what was

was a gnawing fear in sport's Year of Playing Dangerously. It was a
year when performance-enhancing substances stole headlines in a

Prior to Friday's Sugar Bowl game with Ohio State, the last time
Texas A&AMP;M went bowling in the Big Easy was on Jan. 1, 1940. The
stakes were higher that day, albeit less publicized. The Aggies
held off hometown favorite Tulane 14-13 before a record-setting
crowd of 73,000 in Tulane's own stadium to win A&AMP;M's first and only
national football championship. In the 1990s, that's a big deal.
But on the second day of 1940, the Aggies learned of their

a robust night in the French Quarter celebrating primarily an
undefeated (11-0) 1939 season. (Riggs, Austin American-Statesman)

   For each mile of distance southward from Monterey Bay, the
daytime temperature rises by one degree. This means that wineries
in the southern half of Monterey concentrate on hot-weather grapes
like cabernet, sauvignon blanc, zinfandel and assorted Rhone
varietals.
</P>
<P>
   And there is one more peculiarity to the area: Carmel Valley, a
tiny pocket at the north end of Monterey County, is protected from
wind and fog and is therefore hospitable to cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the area can be tricky to figure out. About 80
percent of Monterey grapes are sold to wineries outside the county
and, like uncredited actors, slip into various blends. Mondavi's
Woodbridge wines have used Monterey grapes for years, for example.
Some wineries, like Testarossa and Nichols, use grapes from
Monterey and indicate this fact on the label, but they are not
situated in Monterey. Others, like Wente, the Hess Collection and
Mirassou, own vineyards in Monterey but do not make the wine there.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey itself has 20 wineries, but the wines may be designated
in any of several ways. Many carry the designation Monterey County,
but some use a specific appellation, like Santa Lucia Highlands,
Arroyo Seco, Carmel Valley or Chalone. Durney Vineyards prints
``Carmel Valley'' on its labels, with no mention of Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardus, also in the Carmel Valley, puts ``Monterey County''
on its wines that use grapes from vineyards scattered around the
county, but its Marinus wine, whose grapes come from the Carmel
Valley vineyard of the same name, is labeled ``Carmel Valley.''
Testarossa makes a Chalone chardonnay, but it is, of course, not
the same winery as Chalone Vineyard. In any case, no one can say
what the appellations really mean when it comes to the personality
of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hodgepodge of areas,'' said Peter Marks, the wine buyer
for Draeger's, the deluxe supermarket chain in Northern California.
``It will take a lot more wineries to lend definition to these
names.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Marks said, Monterey remains a wide-open region,
with a great deal of land still available for vineyards and a lot
of detective work to be done before winemakers figure out exactly
what goes where. ``A lot of these places remain to be discovered,
but once that happens, Monterey will really take off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Monterey enjoys a solid reputation at the lower
end of the price scale, with wineries like Estancia and J. Lohr
turning out approachable, easy-to-drink chardonnays and pinot noirs
for about $10, and Lockwood Vineyard, at the southern end of
Monterey County, making some eye-catching chardonnays for about
$15. At about $10, Mondavi's Coastal label chardonnay and pinot
noir deliver unexpected elegance. The chardonnay is tart and
steely, with an underlay of rich butterscotch. The pinot is
light-bodied, fruity and bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, we're sourcing about two-thirds of our grapes
from Monterey and a third from Santa Barbara County,'' Shyvers
said. ``We'd like to evolve everything to Monterey, although it
will take time to understand the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Upward from the bargain-priced wines, Monterey has several
wineries that have caught the eye of the critics in recent years.
Chalone Vineyards, the oldest winery in the region, comes near the
top of any list, with its lean, minerally chardonnays and a
luscious pinot blanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being in a slump for about a decade, they are back with
a vengeance,'' John Gilman, the sommelier at Gotham Bar and Grill
in Manhattan, said. ``Their reserve chardonnay came out first in a
recent tasting we held at the restaurant. We were shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Talbott has attained something like cult status for his
classic, silken pinot noirs and for his chardonnays from the
Diamond T and Sleepy Hollow vineyards. They are priced accordingly,
from $30 to $45. Almost next door, Lee has been making rich,
Meursault-like reserve chardonnays that sell for about $25. Another
standout is a vineyard, not a winery. The pinot noir grapes from
the Pisoni Vineyard have been used to stunning effect by Nichols
and Testarossa.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel Valley, with only five wineries, has two top-level
performers in Durney Vineyards and Bernardus. In the last five
years or so, Durney has been turning out luscious, deep cabernets
for less than $20 and a fruity, crisp chenin blanc that qualifies
as a real charmer. Bernardus, just up the road, makes a rich, deep
Bordeaux-style blend called Marinus that, at $30, is the kind of
bargain that wine lovers expect from Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the big guys would trash Monterey and then buy
our fruit,'' said Robert Talbott, swirling a glass of his pinot
noir and looking at it with unfeigned admiration. ``Now they're
buying up the whole valley. Everybody wants to be here now.''

FROM JAPAN, THE SECRET OF CRUNCHY COATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Japanese product named Panko sounds as if it might
be the next toy craze. But a kitchen craze is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Panko is Japanese for ``bread crumbs,'' and chefs and home cooks
are discovering that this light, airy variety is worlds away from
the acrid, herb-flecked, additive-laden bread crumbs in the
supermarket, the more upscale crumbs from a bakery like Ecce Panis
or even homemade bread crumbs from leftover loaves.
</P>
<P>
   Panko has a texture more like crushed cornflakes or potato
chips, but with a neutral flavor, only a trifle sweet. Some panko
is made with honey, some with sugar, but all contains a sweetener
and some kind of fat, which makes the crumbs brown more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Panko is what gives tonkatsu, the fried pork cutlet served in
Japanese restaurants, its coarse-grained, crunchy crumb coating.
Some caterers in New York and California have also started using
panko to give deep-fried cocktail-party shrimp a textural boost and
keep sogginess at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The texture of the crumbs is very important in the way it
performs,'' said Wayne Nish, the chef and an owner of March
restaurant, who was among the first to use panko to bread chicken,
fish and even rack of lamb in non-Japanese recipes. ``The structure
creates little air pockets to help keep it crispy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, panko is coming full circle around the globe these
days. It actually reached Japan via Western cuisines. In 1543,
bread was introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders, the first
Europeans to land there. The Portuguese word for bread, ``pao,''
became ``pan.'' Around 100 years ago, the Japanese interest in
Western food grew, said Elizabeth Andoh, a cookbook author and
teacher, who is based in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular, there was a fascination with German and
Prussian food, a result of the Japanese envy of German military
prowess,'' she said. ``They thought the diet was an important
factor in German might, so the Japanese imitated Wiener schnitzel
with pork, calling it ``katsudetsu,'' which became ``tonkatsu.''
They used ground dried bread, or panko, as a coating. And they
began serving it in the military academies.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan won its war with Russia in 1905, and that did it, Ms.
Andoh said. Guns, tonkatsu and panko were there to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bread is essentially a dense, white squared-off
sandwich bread, what might be called a Pullman loaf. But it has a
striated texture, and when it dries and is pulverized, it breaks
into spiky little shards, instead of fine, sandlike crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Masayuki Shimura, the manager of Inagiku restaurant in the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel, said that most Japanese panko makers no
longer bake bread and pulverize it but have machines that spray
unbaked bread dough directly onto heated iron sheets and bake it
into shards. Panko in Japan is sold in rough, medium and fine
textures, Shimura said.
</P>
<P>
   He said panko is not for fancy food; at his restaurant it is
used only for dishes served to employees, not on the regular menu.
In takeout shops in Japan, Ms. Andoh said, panko is used to coat
croquettes, which are eaten at room temperature or reheated. Yet
the Fauchon store in Tokyo makes its own panko from white bread
like the kind the Japanese delight in slicing thick and toasting
for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Panko not only provides a crispy coating, but it also makes a
lighter stuffing for anything from mushrooms to trout, especially
when the crumbs are toasted first. And it's even good to sweeten
and use to layer phyllo or put in a pie shell.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Wine, the restaurant consultant, who often travels to
Japan, said he has used panko as a topping for macaroni and cheese,
and to add extra texture to French toast. Whenever a crunchy
coating is desired, and especially if the breaded food will be in
contact with moisture, panko delivers abiding crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Buying panko, which costs about $2 for 12 ounces, still takes an
excursion to a Japanese or Asian market. High on the list are Sam
Bok, 127 West 43rd St.; Katagiri, 224 East 59th St., and Sunrise
Market, 4 Stuyvesant St., at Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it comes in a cellophane bag, which tends to
spill willy-nilly as you pour. The cardboard canisters used for
American bread crumbs would be an improvement. Meantime, just
transfer it to a jar or other container.

</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup panko
</P>
<P>
   2 slices good-quality white bread, each an inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Marmalade, jam, maple syrup or confectioners' sugar (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Beat eggs in a shallow bowl, and stir in 2 tablespoons
half-and-half. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place half the
panko on each of two salad-size plates.
</P>

   3. Place a nonstick skillet large enough to hold both slices of
bread over medium-high heat. Divide the butter in half, and place
each piece in a spot in the skillet where a slice of bread will go,
then immediately put the coated bread on top of the butter,
panko-side down. Saute until the panko is golden, about 3 minutes,
then pour the remaining half-and-half on top of the bread. Don't
worry if some of the liquid spills into the pan. Turn the bread,
and saute until golden on the other side. Then serve at once, with
any of the optional toppings.

DARWINIAN DAYS GONE FOR FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Mariucci picked a ruthless occupation, and
a ruthless organization picked Mariucci. The 49ers jettisoned Joe
Montana and Ronnie Lott, so why not the young head coach?
</P>
<P>
   He is 25-7 in two regular seasons, and anywhere else, he would
be invulnerable. But Mariucci coaches the 49ers, and on his watch,
they have surrendered their domain, the NFC West, and lost two
straight to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This still shouldn't be enough to put him in harm's way, but
George Seifert reached the 1996 NFC title game with a badly damaged
Steve Young and was ushered out the door the minute the season
ended. This is the way the 49ers do business, the way they treat
family. So why not Mariucci?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the scenario,'' said Jerry Rice, cutting through the
niceties. ``I've been in the league 14 years, and there are
questions about me, right? It's a business, and I'm learning. I'm
learning fast. Ain't no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   But the business has changed for the 49ers. For years, Darwinian
principles favored them. They could get rid of anybody, because
they were bigger than any one player or one coach. They could
hemorrhage talent and turn around to find someone else happy to
open a vein on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams had to worry about whether they could afford to lose
a star, whether they could land a great new head coach. They
couldn't afford to be ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   So why not, at long last, the 49ers?
</P>
<P>
   Who says they can afford to dump a talented young coach on the
assumption that something or someone better is waiting for them?
</P>
<P>
   The rampant speculation around these parts says that Mike
Holmgren will be courted by the Niners if his Packers beat
Mariucci's squad in this weekend's playoff game. Mariucci's stock
will take a dive, and he will be expendable, even with three years
left on his contract. Or so the reasoning goes.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody really knows what the 49ers, as an organization, want
to do. Maybe they don't, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have anything but rumors?'' Steve Young asked, when
questioned about Mariucci's alleged predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all we have are hints. The biggest one is that
Mariucci was approached about a contract extension in early October
and that the deal never got done.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the club's confidence in its young coach
wavered as the penalties piled up, as Atlanta rode higher and
higher, as the sacks kept coming and the pitiful teams that once
bowed to the 49ers at kickoff struck for early leads?
</P>
<P>
   That's possible, but the inability to complete an extension
discredits the 49ers' front office more than it does Mariucci. With
three years left on his old deal, the only legitimate reason to
offer a new one was a desire for clarity, to center the club in the
absence of a president, general manager and owner. To make that
move, to aim for clarity, the Niners needed to be clear themselves,
certain that they had the coach that they wanted for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   They slipped a rug under Mariucci, and then it got pulled out.
By him? By them? It doesn't matter. The Niners should never have
let it happen. It reveals them to be either vacillating or
ineffectual, neither of which is remotely related to ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption behind the Holmgren rumors is that the Packers
coach can have his pick of jobs after the season. He wants to be a
coach and general manager, and the 49ers happen to have an opening
in the GM's spot. But even if the Niners were willing to sweep
aside Mariucci to create room for Holmgren, who says that San
Francisco would be his first choice?
</P>
<P>
   He is a native of the city, and that could be inducement. But
what reason does he have to believe that the 49ers, in their
current predicament, can foster greatness for much longer?
</P>
<P>
   Will Eddie DeBartolo, whenever he returns from his Cajun-fried
exile, still have pockets deep enough to a) pay Mariucci's contract
off, b) spend the millions in salary it would take to lure a
Holmgren here and c) assure that the next general manager has
enough payroll money to continue tooling around the salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   On purely football terms, Carolina may have a better job to
offer. So might Seattle, with Paul Allen's millions. In those
towns, the resources are fairly predictable and extremely generous,
while the expectations are lower. A coach with a 12-4 record
wouldn't be asked to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is an aging roster and a pending salary-cap
nightmare, not to mention a front office with tumbleweeds blowing
through it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, Mariucci may have more leverage than
the 49ers. If, somehow, he is in jeopardy, he should know that a
job will turn up quickly. Cleveland would surely make a play for
him if the 49ers went the ruthless route.
</P>
<P>
   If the Niners win this weekend, and their chances look good from
here, this whole issue could be moot. Then again, it could be moot
now. Nobody knows, because there is really nobody to ask.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there was always someone with an answer, even if it
was just another round of slippery comments from Carmen Policy.
Now, all is silent. They don't do business the same way anymore.
They've lost too much in the last year, maybe even the ability to
be ruthless.

CITIES CRITICIZE PLAN FOR NEW BAY BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The state Transportation Department faces almost
certain legal challenges as it moves ahead with a plan to replace a
heavily used bridge that was badly damaged in a 1989 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The department, known as Caltrans, is moving forward with plans
to place the eastern span of the Bay Bridge north of the current
structure, a design that the Metropolitan Transportation Commission
recommended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Mulligan, program manager of the Toll Bridge Program, said
Caltrans was bracing for lawsuits and expected that many would be
filed in June, when the choice is expected to be finalized.
However, he said, a delay in construction seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every large project we do gets sued,'' Mulligan said. ``The
question is how often and by whom. We can't satisfy all the
competing interests on this issue. We'll proceed with our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans made its announcement Monday, rejecting five
alternatives. The bridge is expected to cost $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans has begun design of the northern alignment of the
bridge, drilling in various areas across the San Francisco Bay to
determine seismic responses on the Bay floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motivation, why we're not sitting on our hands, is we live
in a seismic zone. ... It's prudent to proceed as expeditiously as
possible,'' Mulligan said.
</P>
<P>
   The upper deck of the eastern span collapsed during the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. That quake registered 7.1 on the Richter
scale and killed 63 people in the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown was said to be disappointed with Caltrans'
decision, a spokesman said. The Brown administration favors a span
that would be constructed on the southern side of the existing
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though Caltrans is buying themselves a lawsuit,''
said Ron Vinson, the mayor's spokesman. ``San Francisco will
continue to fight for an environmentally friendly southern
alignment. We will continue to work with the city of Oakland, the
Port of Oakland, the Federal Highway Administration, the Coast
Guard, Navy and other entities to develop a consensus for moving
forward with the southern alignment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Port of Oakland and East Bay Regional Park District
oppose a southern alignment because it would cut into property they
use.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no delays, Caltrans plans to begin construction of
the new eastern span in 2000 and complete it in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   As designed, the single-tower suspension bridge would be
positioned to cut into the northeastern edge of Yerba Buena Island
that San Francisco hopes to redevelop once the Navy releases the
property to the city. The design calls for five lanes in each
direction, two 20-foot shoulders and a 15-foot-wide bicycle and
pedestrian path.
</P>
<P>
   After approving a northern alignment two years ago, Brown
changed his position when he realized that the new span and ramps
would wreak havoc with the redevelopment plans for the island. He
has since proposed a span south of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and
Piedmont have pushed the transportation officials to consider a
more elegant design than the proposed single-tower suspension. They
say the 7,800-foot skyway leading to the suspension bridge, which
traverses shallow water, is unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   The design being pushed by Caltrans also doesn't include rail
service, which voters in November said they preferred. Caltrans
argues that the project has financial constraints and that
additional amenities, such as rail service, would not fit in the
budget.

THE CHEF: ITALIAN PORK FROM AN AMERICAN OVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
This is the fourth of eight columns by Alfred Portale, the
executive chef and an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in New York.
His collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan. 
 By ALFRED PORTALE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Growing up in a traditional Italian family, I ate
pork in all its many forms, including ham, sausages _ sweet and hot
_ double-thick chops and slowly braised shoulder roasts. The mild
flavor and appealing texture of pork, which always retains a
measure of firmness, make it ideal to play around with, as it takes
to almost any kind of seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, pork is now so lean that it's not nearly as
flavorful as it used to be. Certainly, it's not as flavorful as
Italian pork _ it was a trip to Italy that inspired me to develop
this fennel-crusted roast.
</P>
<P>
   When my family and I vacationed in Cortona, we shopped in the
local market, where we would buy sandwiches of sliced pork on warm
focaccia for lunch. The pork was moist, had its own distinctive
taste and was thoroughly infused with the inviting flavors of the
herb-covered Tuscan countryside. I was determined to recapture
those flavors back home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the subtle flavor of American pork, I wanted
to use assertive flavors as a marinade and crust. Fennel had to be
the main ingredient, as it is in Italy, and to that base, I added
onion, garlic and the herbs that evoked memories of Tuscany. The
challenge was to get this flavor into the pork and to keep the pork
moist.
</P>
<P>
   Where there's fat, there's flavor, so I chose a pork rib roast
with a layer of fat on it. I first covered the fat with the chopped
fennel and herbs; they promptly fell off in the oven. In my next
attempt, I pureed the ingredients in a food processor and then
patted them onto the meat. They stayed put, and their flavors
seeped into the meat as I let it marinate in the refrigerator. This
crust also kept the roast moist as it cooked. The first bite took
me back to Cortona.
</P>
<P>
   To make cutting the roast easier, ask your butcher to trim the
chine bone to a thickness of \ inch. You can serve the roast with
pureed potatoes or braised cabbage, but I hope you will try the
apple-quince compote. It is sweet, spicy, soft and chunky at the
same time. Best of all, it stands up to the crust's he-man flavors.
</P>
<P>
   FENNEL-CRUSTED PORK WITH WARM APPLE AND QUINCE COMPOTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 3 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 4{-pound pork rib roast, chine bone trimmed to \ inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped fennel (including some of the feathery tops)
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons coarsely ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 large Rome or Cortland apples, peeled, cored and cut into
\-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 large quinces, peeled, cored and cut into \-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   { cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a sharp knife, score a crosshatch pattern on surface of
roast. Rub skin with salt to taste, and place pork in a roasting
pan. In bowl of a food processor, combine chopped fennel, onion,
garlic, thyme, rosemary, sage and oregano. Pulse to coarsely chop.
Scrape down the sides and add fennel seeds and coarsely ground
white pepper. Pulse until mixture is very finely chopped.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pat fennel mixture onto surface of roast to form \-inch
crust. Cover roast and pan with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Remove roast from refrigerator,
and let it rest at room temperature 20 minutes. Discard plastic
wrap, and roast pork until internal temperature reaches 150 degrees
for a pink center (or, if desired, adjust cooking time according to
taste). Begin to check temperature after 1 hour 30 minutes; cooking
time will vary according to initial temperature of roast. Remove
from oven, cover roast with foil and let rest 20 minutes before
carving.
</P>
<P>
   4. While roast is resting, prepare compote. Place a large
skillet over medium heat and melt butter. Add ginger, and stir
until ginger softens but does not color, 1 to 2 minutes. Add apple
and quince, and raise heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until apples are very soft and mixture is lightly
browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Mix in the cider and let it reduce
slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. At this point the apples will have the
consistency of applesauce and the quince will be tender but still
hold its shape. Season the compote with salt and freshly ground
pepper, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, place slices of the roast and crust on each of six
plates, and serve with warm compote.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

`THURGOOD MARSHALL': A CIVIL RIGHTS HERO INSIDE THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thurgood Marshall's is the quintessential American story. Born
to a modest, racially mixed and determined family, he rose on the
basis of talent and hard work to become the first black justice of
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, of course, he deployed the law like an army to
force the United States to live up to the principles on which it
was founded. He was quintessentially American because he used his
brilliance and his sweat to beat the racist establishment at its
own game, defeating it on the very terrain of the law that, until
Marshall came along, it had exploited to maintain its ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   That identity as an American original underlies this fine
biography of Marshall by Juan Williams, a journalist at The
Washington Post and a historian of the civil-rights movement.
Williams, whose previous book was a companion volume to the public
television series ``Eyes on the Prize,'' has written the first
major biography of Marshall, giving him importance in the struggle
for racial justice in America equal to that normally given to his
sometimes friend, sometimes rival, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

<P>
   Williams interviewed Marshall over a period of several months
not long before his death in 1993, and his text is sprinkled with
Marshall's own breezy comments on key incidents in his life.
</P>
<P>
   As a stylist, Williams is more workmanlike than brilliant, and
his work does not have the rich detail or narrative power of the
very best historians of recent events _ say, Robert Caro or Taylor
Branch. But his story of Marshall's life is briskly paced and
scrupulously fair, informed by the same trans-racial vision that
inspired Marshall himself.
</P>
<P>
   Williams avoids the temptation to wax rhapsodic about Marshall's
legal victories or to paint a melodramatic picture of the racial
battles that took place from the 1930s through the '60s. He clearly
admires his subject, but he does not turn away from the less
saintly of his attributes: his drive for recognition, his
bureaucratic ruthlessness, even his willingness to engage in secret
dealings with J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall who emerges from Williams' pages is in many ways an
American revolutionary (as Williams' subtitle has it) but a more
conservative revolutionary than his common image would suggest. He
was, first and foremost, an integrationist who repudiated the black
radicalism of the Black Muslims and Malcolm X. While he admired
King, he was distrustful and a bit contemptuous of King's showy,
attention-grabbing methods of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his heart,'' Williams writes of Marshall's reaction to the
famous Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, ``he viewed the bus boycott
and King's speeches as street theater that did not come close to
equaling the main event _ the NAACP's effort to get the courts to
end legal segregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's core belief was in the law and in the facts: he was
the very opposite of a demagogue. In one instance, investigating
angry Muslim-led accusations that police had brutally beaten a
black woman in New York in 1959, ``I sided with the policemen,''
Marshall told Williams years later.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's core belief was not the radical one that the law
itself is an instrument of white power, as, say, critical race
theory would have it, but that it was a neutral instrument that
could be put to the task of forcing whites to accept blacks as
equals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams traces the full story of the man and the achievements,
beginning with Marshall's origins in the assertive, upwardly mobile
black community of Baltimore. Marshall went to segregated Colored
High and Training School there and then to Lincoln University in
Oxford, Pa., where the student body was black and the faculty
entirely white. He was among 36 matriculating students at Howard
University Law School in 1930 when its president was Charles
Hamilton Houston, whose chief quality was an uncompromising
insistence on high standards. He was the top student of the six
left standing at graduation three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall quickly found his way to the Legal Defense Fund of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where
he pursued his now legendary career in beating back segregation one
difficult case at a time. Some of the most interesting and
inspiring of Williams' chapters detail the early
anti-discrimination cases through which Marshall built both the
legal precedents and the personal experience for Brown vs. Board of
Education, by which the Supreme Court finally ruled against
segregated education in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years out of law school in 1935, Marshall won the first
in a long series of cases against segregation in education,
persuading a court to force the University of Maryland to admit a
black applicant to its law school. In 1944, in a case argued by
Marshall and his colleague, Bill Hastie, the Supreme Court ruled
that an all-white Democratic primary election in Texas was
unconstitutional. In 1947 and 1949 the Supreme Court overturned
convictions of black defendants, accepting Marshall's argument that
blacks had been systematically excluded from serving on juries.
During these years, Marshall lost some heartbreaking cases, but, by
1950, when his victory in Sweatt vs. Painter effectively integrated
the University of Texas Law School, he had won 10 cases before the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sensibly devotes more attention to Marshall's career as
a civil-rights advocate than he does to his record as a judge
which, interesting as it is, is far less revolutionary and less
historically important. Along the way, Williams deals with other
aspects of Marshall's life: his battles against communists and
black radicals within the civil-rights movement, his strangely
cooperative relationship with Hoover, his battles to retain control
of the NAACP, his two marriages, his tenure as solicitor general
under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's life, in short, was a seminal one for 20th-century
American history, and it is well told in Williams' readable and
important book.

`A CIVIL ACTION': A HIGH-STAKES BATTLE, THRICE VISITED

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't already read the best seller and haven't yet
caught the new hit movie, you can get up to speed on ``A Civil
Action'' with Wednesday night's hourlong television version of the
dramatic case that set off the media blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the suspicions of a few parents in the small town
of Woburn, Mass., near Boston, that the leukemia from which their
children suffered and died was caused by tainted water, this
edition of ``American Justice'' turns to the fight by a team of
lawyers to win what they hoped would be a billion-dollar judgment
against two Fortune 500 companies, W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods.
One mother says, ``The only thing industry understands is money.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus here is on Jan Schlictmann (appearing in the program,
but played in the movie by John Travolta), described as a
flamboyant ``high-stakes player'' who took on the suit in the early
1980s and pursued it for almost a decade with the prospect of
bringing justice to the families and making a killing for his firm,
which would take a third of any settlement. ``This was war, not
litigation,'' announces Schlictmann of the bitter courtroom
struggle that finally drove him into penury.
</P>
<P>
   As A&AMP;E's ubiquitous narrator, Bill Kurtis, explains matters, the
plaintiffs had to prove two elements: that the drinking water was
contaminated by the companies and that the contamination caused the
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The critical early decision by the judge, Walter Skinner, to
postpone the parents' moving testimony until those questions of
fact were resolved lest the jury's judgment be overwhelmed by
sympathy deprived the plaintiffs of their most potent weapon. It
becomes evident from the program that no love was lost between
Skinner and Schlictmann, whose attacks an opposing lawyer calls
``scurrilous.'' In an interview, the judge admits to a certain
impatience with what some saw as the lawyer's flirtation with
paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional slip into cliche (``tragedy struck
again''), this is a well-reported hour that brings together
inestimable personal loss, big-money legal wranglings and courtroom
antipathies. An epilogue tells of belated orders for cleanups of
the polluted areas. For what comfort that can offer the stricken
parents and the bankrupt lawyers, Kurtis says, ``By losing the
battle, the plaintiffs may have won the war.''

Gov.-elect Don Siegleman on the same topic. All three were elected
promising a lottery for education, and the others are asking Miller
for advice. Miller, for his part, is asking the other two how much

 &HT;    MITCHELL PROMISES 'THOROUGH AND PROMPT' PROBE OF SALT LAKE CITY
OLYMPICS BID
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (s) sports, (i) international and
(w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. George Mitchell on Tuesday promised to
direct a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into allegations
that thousands of dollars worth of possibly illegal favors were
used to lure the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, named by the U.S. Olympic Committee to head a
six-person ``special commission'' to look into the charges, refused
during a press conference to rule out the possibility his group
also would ask questions about methods used a decade ago to bring
the 1996 Olympics to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other members of the newly appointed commission
indicated that any questions about the Atlanta games would be for
the purpose of understanding the overall climate in which U.S.
cities compete with foreign cities for the right to host the
events.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said serving on the commission would not interfere with
his role as an advisor to President Clinton during impeachment
proceedings, which appear likely to occur at the same time the
Olympics investigation is going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission is now one of four organizations,
including the Justice Department, looking into allegations that
college scholarships, free medical service and lavish gifts were
used to get members of the International Olympic Committee to vote
in favor of Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The international committee and an independent ethics panel in
Salt Lake City also are investigating the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman confirmed last week that federal
investigators are looking into methods used by organizers of the
Salt Lake City bid. Published reports said the probe would focus on
possible violations of federal bribery, mail fraud and tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Mitchell commission are Bill Hybl,
president of the U.S. Olympics Committee; Donald Fehr, executive
director of the Major League Baseball Players Association; Ken
Duberstein, former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan;
Roberta Cooper Ramo of Albuquerque, N.M., past president of the
American Bar Association, and Jeff Benz, at-large member of the
U.S. Olympic Committee athletes' advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the commission not associated with the U.S.
Olympics Committee is Ramo. Duberstein and Mitchell already served
on the committee's ethics panel and Fehr is a member of the
committee's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision of whether Salt Lake City will be allowed
to continue as the host city for the 2002 Winter Games is not up to
the U.S. committee, Mitchell said he expected the games to be held
there. A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee has said
the games will not be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do the best we can within our power and scope to
determine what the context was of these actions,'' Mitchell said,
adding that his commission also will attempt to provide
recommendations to the U.S. Olympic Committee for ``guidelines and
enforcement mechanisms'' to assure that future efforts by U.S.
cities to lure Olympic games are above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Without subpoena powers, the inquiry will be conducted on the
basis of voluntarily-provided information from persons involved in
attracting Olympic games, he said. It is to be completed by Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to begin by saying that we are looking at Salt
Lake City or we are looking at Atlanta,'' Mitchell said when asked
if his the commission would restrict its questions to the Utah
city's bid. ``We will do what's necessary to establish fairly the
context in which these events occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at another point that ``if there were activities in the
past that were inappropriate, we want to make sure they don't occur
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He generally avoided answering questions about the impeachment
proceedings facing Clinton but said that ``my role in this
commission will not preclude my role in the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a former federal prosecutor and U.S. district judge in
Maine, was majority leader of the Senate from 1989 to1994 and
served this year as Clinton's special representatives to talks that
led to a cease-fire in Northern Ireland.

NEW PRODUCTIONS ARE A REVELATION: RACINE WORKS IN TRANSLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(rl) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PARIS _ Jean Racine may not be a household name in the
English-speaking theater world, but the great 17th-century French
tragedian is not faring too well at home, either.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, French high school students were expected to
read and dissect several plays by Racine before graduating. Today,
the Education Ministry's curriculum requires them to study just one
play by Corneille or Racine. So if the teacher's choice is
Corneille's epic, ``Le Cid,'' Racine remains, well, the name of a
street.
</P>
<P>
   True, at the stately Comedie Francaise, which keeps records
dating back to the company's creation in 1680, Racine still ranks
second _ albeit a distant second _ to Moliere as the most produced
playwright: 9,291 performances for Racine against 31,844 for
Moliere through 1997. This year, the 300th anniversary of Racine's
death, two of his plays, ``Andromaque'' and ``Mithridate,'' will
again be staged by the Comedie. But he is clearly not the star he
was here 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, Racine is also suffering as French loses its
place to English as the compulsory second language. His grandiose
Greek- and Roman-inspired tragedies about lives torn apart by
destiny, love, ambition, betrayal and cruelty were always regarded
as pillars of French classicism. Yet, because his genius was
thought to lie in his use of language, notably his rolling waves of
alexandrine verse, the whole point was to read Racine in French.
And nowadays fewer people can do that: The number of Europeans
studying French _ or able to understand a play in French _
continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the afterlife of Racine, then, the acclaimed new London
productions of his ``Phedre'' and ``Britannicus'' _ in repertory at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater through Jan. 17 _
are particularly significant. As presented by the innovative
Almeida Theater Company, with Diana Rigg and Toby Stephens
appearing in both plays, the productions have demonstrated that
Racine can indeed work in translation, that he does have box-office
appeal and that he can be made relevant to today's audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``In England, Racine has always had the slightly gritted-teeth
feeling of school exams,'' said Jonathan Kent, director of both
productions. ``But it's a mistake to see him as a sort of
statuesque, cerebral academic exercise. He operates at a white-hot
laser intensity. What's extraordinary about him is that he accords
with our late-20th-century sensibilities in a way that the more
humanist Shakespeare does not. The complexity of the psychological
relationships in his plays is quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   In any successful English-language production, the secret to
unleashing the full force of Racine's words lies in the quality of
the translation. For this, Kent turned to writers who chose
different styles. Ted Hughes, Britain's poet laureate who died in
October, decided to render ``Phedre'' in free verse in the apparent
belief that in English, alexandrine couplets would restrict the
emotional flow of what is perhaps Racine's greatest tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Britannicus,'' Robert David MacDonald, a Scottish actor,
director, playwright and translator, created his own rhyming
couplets, which seem to suit the more cynical power struggle of
Nero's Roman court portrayed in this play. Thus, Hughes' language
has the heated pace of machine-gun fire, while MacDonald's verses
are woven like spiders' webs.
</P>
<P>
   For the director and cast, Hughes' involvement proved
particularly exciting. Kent said his letter inviting the poet to
translate ``Phedre'' was followed by two months of silence. Then,
one day, a script arrived in the mail. Hughes was so enthused with
the project that, although ailing with cancer, he attended
rehearsals and saw several performances before his death. In a
sense, it had also become his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted's version in free verse acts as a detonation at the heart
of Racine,'' Kent said. ``It releases the play in a way that of
course is not true to the letter of Racine but is true to the
spirit. It is played at a pitch and level of intensity that I hope
liberate the play from any sense of the museum piece or interesting
piece of theatrical archaeological dig.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rigg, as Phedre, suffers to the point of taking her life
over her unrequited love for her stepson, Hyppolytus, played by
Stephens, the son of the renowned English actors Maggie Smith and
the late Robert Stephens. In her experience with the play, Ms. Rigg
said, no less than in the French original, it is language _ Hughes'
language _ that gradually overwhelms the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ears are starved for abundant rich language,'' said Ms. Rigg,
who first took on the role 20 years ago. ``Here, it is like a tidal
wave. It starts and goes and goes inexorably. It is a tradition
resurrected, which is why I love it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Britannicus,'' the process was simpler. While Hughes
worked with Kent and Ms. Rigg on the final version of ``Phedre,''
MacDonald delivered his script and simply authorized whatever
changes were felt necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhyming couplets are perfect for `Britannicus' because it is a
glittering, political, sophisticated piece, a sort of grand soap,''
noted Ms. Rigg, who in this play appears opposite Stephens' Nero as
his devious mother, Agrippina. ``Wit is quite important and rhyming
couplets serve wit. I don't think they serve high drama terribly
well. You tend to get a plonk at the end of the line, which can be
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent had previously directed English-language versions of ``Le
Cid'' and of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and ``School for Wives,'' but
this was his first meeting with the youngest of the trinity of
17th-century French theatrical masters. As always, though, as with
Corneille and Moliere, and in his production of Euripides'
``Medea'' (seen on Broadway in 1994 with Ms. Rigg, who won a Tony
Award for the role), he said he approaches classical plays as
contemporary works.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful is that audiences have discovered them as new
plays,'' the 49-year-old director said in a telephone interview
from London. ``At most, a few people had a dim folk memory of
`Phedre' as some mother in love with her son. But people had no
idea what `Britannicus' is about. And the genius of the play is
that it operates as a sort of political thriller. People love
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast cultural gap represented by the narrow English
Channel, it is, of course, unsurprising that Kent and his team
believe they are presenting Racine with a freshness absent in
French productions. Indeed, for most English theatergoers,
classical French theater a la Comedie Francaise is still that of
formal gestures and grand oratory. In the case of Racine, Kent
said, ``The language is indulged in a way that I think does him a
disservice.'' And Ms. Rigg offered: ``We can look at him with
reverence and awe, but we can also blow the dust off him.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, France has a tradition of worshipping at the altar of
its cultural icons. But it also enjoys attacking these icons in the
name of historical conflicts _ monarchism vs. republicanism, Roman
Catholicism vs. secularism, right vs. left _ that have a peculiar
way of resurfacing. And so it is that Racine has of late been
deemed politically incorrect in some French intellectual circles.
</P>
<P>
   For them, Racine's first offense was to have been educated by a
pious Catholic movement known as Jansenism, based at the Convent of
Port-Royal near Paris. When Racine moved to Paris in 1658 at the
age of 19, he turned to writing, first odes to Louis XIV, then a
play put on by Moliere's company. But he soon broke with Moliere
just as he broke with Jansenism and, when he was proclaimed the new
Corneille after the success of ``Andromaque'' in 1667, he added
fans of the aging Corneille to his list of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, as Racine's genius flowered, he wrote one
comedy, ``Les Plaideurs,'' a satire of the French legal system, and
six more great tragedies, climaxing with ``Phedre.'' Then, after
``Phedre,'' he abruptly abandoned writing and became the king's
official historiographer and a favorite of the court. Although a
famous scandal erupted when he was accused of poisoning his
mistress, in his 50s he rediscovered religion and wrote two plays
around biblical themes. When he died in 1699, he asked to be buried
at Port-Royal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What irritates me is that for the last 50 years Racine has
been seen as a villain, a social-climbing courtesan,'' said Anne
Delbee, an actor and director who has put on most of Racine's
plays, including eight different productions of ``Phedre.'' ``He
was seen as someone who betrayed everyone, which I think is
ridiculous. It's lucky he left Moliere or he might never have
become Racine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on the reaction of audiences attending her most
recent ``Phedre'' at the Comedie Francaise in 1996, Ms. Delbee
believes young people are showing new interest in Racine because
modern concerns, such as disillusionment with politics and a
growing spirituality, are sharply mirrored in his plays.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mesguich, an actor and director of forthcoming
productions of ``Andromaque'' and ``Mithridate,'' also believes
Racine to be topical today, though he speaks scathingly of attempts
to modernize the author's themes and characters. ``When I hear
people say you should blow the dust off the classics, I say the
opposite,'' he explained. ``I think we should show the dust on
stage and work with the distance that separates us from the text.
We need distance to understand the 20th century, so why not go back
to the 17th century? But that's different from crushing the 17th
century with the 20th century, as the updaters do, or from
presenting a pseudo 17th century, as the orthodox do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesguich believes new meaning can always be found hidden in
Racine's texts because, he said, unlike Corneille and Moliere,
Racine wrote in a complex manner, at one level with great clarity,
at another level infusing deep tragedy into his very language.
</P>
<P>
   So can Racine survive in translation? ``I have always felt that
Racine would work there,'' Ms. Delbee said upon learning of the new
London productions. ``I always said another poet should do the
translations. Better a parallel poem than a word-for-word
translation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesguich was less certain. He recently directed a
French-language version of ``The Tempest.'' But Racine, he
cautioned, is not Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of Shakespeare, the greatest writer of all time, is
that there is a lot of meaning beyond the words,'' he said.
``Racine was a lesser genius and therefore more precise and more
limited. So, when he is translated, you lose more. With
Shakespeare, you lose perhaps 30 percent of the impact. With
Racine, you lose perhaps 50 or 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with great classics is that there never is a
definitive translation, one that acquires an aura of its own by
being studied _ and performed _ through the ages. But the London
productions of ``Phedre'' and ``Britannicus'' have also shown this
to be a good thing. Thanks to frequent new translations, each
generation can see old texts through its own eyes. And here, at
least, Racine has benefited. He may be speaking in strange tongues,
but he seems to be making himself perfectly clear.

DEFORESTATION ADDED TO MITCH DEVASTATION, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA ESPERANZA, Honduras _ Juan Benito Palma scans the deep sea of
mud, rocks and uprooted trees that now fills what was once a green,
tranquil valley near the mouth of the Choluteca River on Honduras'
Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a break from chopping wood and, straightening his back,
sweeps a hand toward the low range of mountains a half-mile across
the rubble. Once this was all watermelon fields, he says. Over
there were pastures for goats and cattle. The tallest, prettiest
trees used to shade the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was beautiful,'' Palma says, grimacing at the pile of
debris that rises higher than a standing man and wider than a dozen
football fields laid end to end. ``Now look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like all of Honduras has been brought here,'' he says.
``The flood carried everything down.``
</P>
<P>
   The flood was caused by Hurricane Mitch, which worked its way
across this bedeviled land in late October. The storm killed at
least 5,600 people in Honduras, damaged or destroyed the homes of a
million more and left some 8,000 still missing here, according to
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also scraped away scarce topsoil, collapsed
mountainsides and gnawed at an ecosystem already frayed from
over-farming, over-logging, over-building and over-population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should serve as a lesson,'' says Edwin Mateo Molina, a
Honduran sociologist who specializes in environmental issues for
the Inter-American Development Bank. ``Everyone realizes that the
damage was magnified by the misuse of resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will happen again,'' Molina says of Mitch's accentuated
destruction, ``and will be even worse unless we look for a way to
use the land in a more responsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of logging the once-thick pines in the mountains and
clearing the rain forests in the coastal lowlands for farming meant
that there was little left to hold the soil when Mitch's deluge
came.
</P>
<P>
   Years of building makeshift houses and solid middle-class
neighborhoods along riverbanks, gullies and flood plains had
ignored the urge of water to reclaim its own balance.
</P>
<P>
   Years of chopping, building and clearing had subdued the
Honduran landscape under the weight of a burgeoning population.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Mitch, the Honduran highlands look as if some giant
beast has swaggered through, scratching the mountainsides with
vengeful claws, sending everything tumbling into the deep valleys
and away.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, tidal surges have swept away houses. Rivers have
changed course, collapsing dikes, sweeping entire neighborhoods
from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is going to demand its quota,'' Molina says. ``It's not
that the rivers entered houses. Houses entered the river.``
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Nicaragua, about 100 miles south of La Esperanza,
a murderous landslide caused by Mitch's rains killed as many as
2,000 people. Environmentalists say that deforestation contributed
to the tragedy, which occurred when a mudflow at the rim of a small
volcano tumbled unhindered to the sea, burying several villages of
farmers drawn to the region years before in search of fertile
lands. Once the landslide began Oct. 30, geologists say, there was
little to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains of south-central Honduras, 40 miles to the
north of La Esperanza, Jose Santos just smiles wearily and points
up the steep slope across the highway from his house to where his
two acres of corn once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Like many poor farmers in a country with little flat land,
Santos has had to scratch his fields into slopes whose grade would
challenge a Swiss skier. He built small dams on mountain streams to
irrigate his grain. He cut away trees to have more land to plant.
</P>
<P>
   When Mitch came, Santos says, the dam went first. And then the
few trees that were left. And then the corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining day and night, night and day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche swept across the road, which connects the capital
of Tegucigalpa with the Pacific coast, to the right and left of
Santos' house, and on down the steep valley walls to a river, which
connected to another, which swept away about a third of the town of
Pespire, 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good soil is all gone,'' Santos says, nodding toward the
rock-strewn soil of what's left of his runaway field. ``But we've
got to try to plant again. There is no other land around here.''
</P>
<P>
   With population growth of about 3 percent a year, among the
highest in Latin America, the number of Hondurans tripled between
1945 and 1988 and now stands at about 5.5 million. Despite decades
of immigration to the cities, nearly 60 percent of Hondurans still
live in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   As in many Latin American countries, wealthy ranchers and
farmers control the best land along river bottoms and wide valleys.
An exploding peasant population on a limited amount of tillable
land led the government in the 1970s to encourage the settlement of
the thickly forested mountains and plains of northern and eastern
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   While it alleviated some of the population pressures in the
impoverished central and southern mountains, the resettlement to
the north also spread the country's deforestation problem.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1962 and 1990, Honduras lost nearly 20 percent of its
forests, according to a recently published study by the World
Wildlife Foundation. Deforestation continues at a pace of some
250,000 acres a year, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been made worse by the export-focused economic
policies of the past decade, which have further concentrated much
of the best land in a few wealthy hands at the expense of the poor
majority of farmers, the World Wildlife study and others argue.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants now plant corn and other crops up the sides of steep,
thinly soiled mountains along the Caribbean coast that were virgin
forests just a few decades ago. And flooding in the newly settled
areas was as bad as anywhere, Molina and other environmentalists
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ecological pressure in the countryside is worsening,''
says Rafael Diaz, president of an umbrella group of 100
nongovernmental aid agencies, many of which work in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, sustainable development and farming techniques
that do not destroy the land rank among the primary focuses of aid
efforts by foreign governments and the more than 300 aid agencies
in Honduras. So far, some aid experts say, there have been few good
results.
</P>
<P>
   But with Honduras' population expected to double, to about 12
million people, in the next 25 years, experts here say that
developing a more ecologically friendly economy is of primary
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look for policies that won't damage the earth,''
says Oscar Fernandez, coordinator of the Honduran Red Cross' relief
effort in along the Pacific coast. ``We have to learn to live with
the land, not just on it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Bitterly cold air will pour from southern Canada across the
Great Lakes into the interior Northeast on Wednesday. Locally heavy
snow squalls will lash areas near the southern and eastern shores
of the Great Lakes, especially during the first half of the day.
Snow showers will also be common near the northern and central
Appalachians, particularly along west-facing slopes. Winds from the
northwest averaging 15 to 25 miles an hour with frequent gusts over
35 miles hour will intensify the chill of the day.
</P>
<P>
   East of the Appalachians, readings will be near or above
freezing at dawn, but temperatures will fall steadily during the
day. Ample sunshine will develop in the Middle Atlantic states, but
plenty of clouds will linger farther north. Heavy snow will
gradually end over northern Maine, however, snow showers and
flurries will persist in the hilly terrain of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will turn brisk and chilly in the wake of a cold
front. Despite ample sunshine afternoon temperatures will average
around 10 degrees below the seasonal average over interior
sections.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of snow will streak from the northern Plains
toward the central Mississippi Valley in advance of a
moisture-starved low pressure area. Up to a few inches of snow may
accumulate in parts of the southern Missouri Valley by Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore breezes will promote some coastal showers in the Pacific
Northwest. Intermittent snow will fall along the west-facing slopes
from the northern Cascades to the Bitterroots. Meanwhile, the
Southwest will be mild and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow Drought
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital is not a snowy place. On average, about 18
inches falls each year. But recently, the absence of snow has
reached record proportions. On Dec. 23, 0.4 inches of snow fell,
ending a string of 378 days without measurable snow at the
observation site at National Airport. The previous record was 321
days ending on Feb. 22, 1973. It has now been almost 23 months
since the last time there has been an inch of snow on a single day
which also is a record for lack of snow. A major winter storm will
bring the threat of some snow, ice and rain to Washington this
weekend. &QL;

 &HT;    MITCHELL PROMISES 'THOROUGH AND PROMPT' PROBE OF SALT LAKE CITY
OLYMPICS BID
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (s) sports, (i) international and

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. George Mitchell on Tuesday promised to
direct a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into allegations
that thousands of dollars worth of possibly illegal favors were
used to lure the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, named by the U.S. Olympic Committee to head a
six-person ``special commission'' to look into the charges, refused
during a press conference to rule out the possibility his group
also would ask questions about methods used a decade ago to bring
the 1996 Olympics to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other members of the newly appointed commission
indicated that any questions about the Atlanta games would be for
the purpose of understanding the overall climate in which U.S.
cities compete with foreign cities for the right to host the
events.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said serving on the commission would not interfere with
his role as an advisor to President Clinton during impeachment
proceedings, which appear likely to occur at the same time the
Olympics investigation is going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission is now one of four organizations,
including the Justice Department, looking into allegations that
college scholarships, free medical service and lavish gifts were
used to get members of the International Olympic Committee to vote
in favor of Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The international committee and an independent ethics panel in
Salt Lake City also are investigating the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman confirmed last week that federal
investigators are looking into methods used by organizers of the
Salt Lake City bid. Published reports said the probe would focus on
possible violations of federal bribery, mail fraud and tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Mitchell commission are Bill Hybl,
president of the U.S. Olympics Committee; Donald Fehr, executive
director of the Major League Baseball Players Association; Ken
Duberstein, former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan;
Roberta Cooper Ramo of Albuquerque, N.M., past president of the
American Bar Association, and Jeff Benz, at-large member of the
U.S. Olympic Committee athletes' advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the commission not associated with the U.S.
Olympics Committee is Ramo. Duberstein and Mitchell already served
on the committee's ethics panel and Fehr is a member of the
committee's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision of whether Salt Lake City will be allowed
to continue as the host city for the 2002 Winter Games is not up to
the U.S. committee, Mitchell said he expected the games to be held
there. A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee has said
the games will not be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do the best we can within our power and scope to
determine what the context was of these actions,'' Mitchell said,
adding that his commission also will attempt to provide
recommendations to the U.S. Olympic Committee for ``guidelines and
enforcement mechanisms'' to assure that future efforts by U.S.
cities to lure Olympic games are above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Without subpoena powers, the inquiry will be conducted on the
basis of voluntarily-provided information from persons involved in
attracting Olympic games, he said. It is to be completed by Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to begin by saying that we are looking at Salt
Lake City or we are looking at Atlanta,'' Mitchell said when asked
if his the commission would restrict its questions to the Utah
city's bid. ``We will do what's necessary to establish fairly the
context in which these events occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at another point that ``if there were activities in the
past that were inappropriate, we want to make sure they don't occur
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He generally avoided answering questions about the impeachment
proceedings facing Clinton but said that ``my role in this
commission will not preclude my role in the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a former federal prosecutor and U.S. district judge in
Maine, was majority leader of the Senate from 1989 to1994 and
served this year as Clinton's special representatives to talks that
led to a cease-fire in Northern Ireland.

   A former department store in downtown Charlotte will be the home
of the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. The new showcase for
international craft, an uptown branch of the 62-year-old Mint
Museum, will open Jan. 10. The 82,000-square-foot Montaldo's
Department Store was renovated by Bank of America (formerly
NationsBank) at a cost of $9.5 million. An extravagant blown glass
chandelier by Seattle glass artist Dale Chihuly will be the lobby's
centerpiece. A 40-foot glass wall by Tom Patti will dominate the
carriageway. The permanent collection display on the ground floor
will be ``Currents in Craft,'' illustrating contemporary art in
craft media. The second floor permanent collection, opening in
March, will feature craft developments of the 19th through mid-20th
century. Inaugural exhibitions opening Jan. 10 are ``The White
House Collection of American Crafts'' (through May 30) and ``Harvey
K. Littleton Reflections, 1946-1994'' (through July 4), a
retrospective of the founder of the American studio glass movement.

   Move over, Mickey. Something huge is invading your universe. The
popular Universal Studios Florida, which opened in 1990, will be
joined in May by a $2.6 billion theme park called Universal Studios
Islands of Adventure. Hyped as the ``world's most technologically
advanced theme park,'' the 110-acre complex consists of five
islands, each with its own theme: Seuss Landing, the Lost
Continent, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic Park and Marvel Super Hero Island.
Steven Spielberg is the creative consultant. The two theme parks
are part of Universal Studios Escape, which includes the
just-opened entertainment complex CityWalk; hotel resorts with more
than 5,000 rooms (the first of which will open this year); and
expanded film and television production facilities.

   Not to be outdone by its neighbor to the west _ namely,
Louisiana _ Biloxi, Miss., is throwing a yearlong party to
celebrate the French landing on its shores 300 years ago. Biloxi's
Tricentennial Celebration blasts off with a birthday celebration
(Feb. 13), including a re-enactment of the landing of Pierre
LeMoyne Sieur d'Iberville in 1699, and traditional Mardi Gras
festivities. The Summer Music Festival runs May through October.
The Tricentennial Jazz Band Festival is May 17-18, the
Tricentennial Fourth of July and Fireworks Celebration is on
Independence Day, of course, and the year ends with the
Tricentennial Commission's New Millennium New Year's Eve
Extravaganza. Information: 1-800-245-6943 or

   You could say life is just a bowl of cherries in Macon (Ga.)
during the Cherry Blossom Festival, but the truth is the Yoshino
cherry trees that grace the Middle Georgia city's streets don't
bear fruit _ edible or otherwise. The city's 230,000 trees do,
however, put on quite a show when they bloom around the third week
of March. The 17th annual festival March 19-28 features more than
500 events including parades, historic tours, sports events, arts
and crafts, a hot-air balloon fest, tours of homes, theater, a
street party, an international food fair, multicultural exhibits,
children's activities and fireworks. A '50s and '60s dance will
feature the Coasters, the Platters and the Drifters, and Bertie
Higgins and the Key Largo Band will perform at a beach party. There
also will be concerts by the Atlanta Rhythm Section, Wet Willie and
K.C. and the Sunshine Band. The 1999 theme is ``The Last Blast of
the Century ... As Good as It Gets.''

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CANNOT DIVIDE A LITERARY COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ Iris Murdoch, the celebrated author of 26
rigorously intellectual novels, stood uncertainly in the doorway of
her living room, her face frozen in the blank expression that is a
sure badge of Alzheimer's disease. It was only when she saw her
husband, the critic, professor and novelist John Bayley, that a
flicker of comprehension sparked in her eyes. But it was gone, as
quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, darling,'' Bayley said tenderly, as if speaking to a
beloved child. ``Wouldn't you like to come and sit down?''
</P>
<P>
   It felt at first like a terrible intrusion, being in the house
with the couple. It was unbearably sad to see the once-brilliant
Miss Murdoch, 79, shuffle slowly into the room, sit stiffly and
then do nothing but stare intently ahead. And it was unbearably sad
when Bayley began explaining in his unself-pitying, slightly
quizzical way what life is like now that Alzheimer's has his wife
firmly in its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayley and Miss Murdoch, whose relationship began more than
40 years ago when he saw her bicycling past his window in Oxford
and fell instantly in love, have never had an ordinary
relationship. And by the end of a morning with them, it was
impossible not to believe that _ however odd it may seem _ they
have made their peace, and are alone together in a world that
somehow suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Bayley, who at 73 seems like a wholly sweet and slightly
eccentric uncle, dressed in indifferently fitting, indifferently
laundered clothes with a few strands of fluffy white hair flowing
from the back of his otherwise bald head, makes a passionate case
for this view in his new memoir, ``Elegy for Iris.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is being published in the United States by St.
Martin's Press, has drawn glowing reviews, both as a lyric
description of the arc of a singular marriage and as an unflinching
account of the frustrations of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   There were slight rumblings in the British news media about
Bayley's motives for writing the book. Wasn't it cruel to expose
Miss Murdoch this way, they asked? But Bayley is not embarrassed by
his wife's state, and neither should anyone else be, he said.
``When something like this happens, you lose all sense of shame and
privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Bayley said, stuttering as he does when he
speaks quickly, he fought and raged against his wife's descent into
unknowingness. But he is past that now, and his anger has given way
to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is no longer bringing the pair of us `closer and closer
apart,' in the poet's tenderly ambiguous words,'' he writes, in a
typically graceful passage. ``There is a certain comic irony _
happily, not darkly comic _ that after more than 40 years of taking
marriage for granted, marriage has decided it is tired of this and
is taking a hand in the game. Purposefully, persistently,
involuntarily, our marriage is now getting somewhere. It is giving
us no choice _ and I am glad of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into two parts. The first, ``Then,'' tells
how Bayley, a young and spectacularly unworldly scholar, was
smitten from the moment he glimpsed Miss Murdoch. But she, a
brilliant rising star who was then teaching philosophy at St.
Anne's College, Oxford, proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   When they embraced for the first time, speaking in a childish
shorthand, ``with arms around each other, kissing and rubbing
noses,'' he writes, he began to understand that she needed him as
much as he needed her.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding not to have children, they both went on to have
glittering careers, although Miss Murdoch's was the more public
success. As she was producing novel after novel and being made a
Dame of the British Empire, Bayley was making his own mark, as a
teacher (he retired several years ago as the Warton professor of
English literature at Oxford), reviewer and literary critic whose
many books include studies of Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen and Henry
James, as well as four novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegy for Iris'' is studded with literary references _ it is
clear that he has found solace in literature _ but in conversation
Bayley is so self-effacing that it is easy to forget his formidable
intellect.
</P>
<P>
   To him and his wife, marriage has always meant a refuge from
aloneness, a secure haven that allows them their independence
together. In an odd way, Bayley said, this has helped him deal with
the constraints of the present. He looks forward to the end of the
day, when his wife is safely asleep and he can pour himself a drink
and revisit the comforts of one of his favorite books, typically a
well-worn novel by Barbara Pym or Austen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solitary life is splendid, provided you can lead it with
someone else,'' he said. ``That's paradoxical, but it's extremely
true in our case. We've always had that sort of life; she had her
life, and I had mine. And now one can have that same sort of thing.
I do have that solitary life because she's there, and I couldn't
have it on my own. It would simply disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayley says he would not consider putting Miss Murdoch in a
nursing home unless she became completely unmanageable and no
longer recognized him. She grows agitated when he is away, and he
loses his purpose when he is alone. ``I don't know what to do by
myself when she's not there,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' the second part of the book, takes up their story in
the mid-1990s, when the first signs of Alzheimer's manifested
themselves. It is a chilling account. Miss Murdoch cannot find her
words during a question-and-answer session in Israel. She sets off
for London and returns three hours later, having forgotten where
she was going.
</P>
<P>
   She has trouble writing, for the first time ever (the novel she
is working on, ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' turned out to be her last,
and Murdoch aficionados were puzzled by the inconsistencies in
character and plot). Later, when a doctor asks her who the prime
minister is, she is stymied. ``She had no idea but said to him with
a smile that surely it didn't matter,'' Bayley writes.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, Miss Murdoch didn't seem aware of what was happening
and didn't rebel against it, partly because she never had much of a
sense of self, anyway, Bayley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have a great deal of consciousness of her own,'' he
said. ``Coleridge mentioned the distinction between writers who
live entirely in their selves and writers like Shakespeare who seem
to live a complex external life inside their creations. Iris was
like that. She was extremely sociable and liked to hear about other
people's lives, but she was very incurious about her own.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bayley finished the book a year ago, Miss Murdoch could
have occasional conversations. Very rarely, she still shows
flickers of her old self, but her condition is much worse now. He
has to lock the front door so she won't wander down the street. He
can't take her swimming in the river they have always loved, for
fear that she will suddenly forget how to swim. One of the high
points of their days together is when ``Teletubbies,'' a children's
television show, comes on.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch is like ``a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband
says, and she needs to be fed, bathed and changed. And there is the
constant strain of meals to be prepared, of dishes to be done, of a
house to keep clean.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have always been careless housekeepers, at best, and
now Bayley admits that he has all but given up. Indeed, their house
is shockingly untidy. Coats are piled high on the kitchen floor,
dirty dishes cover the breakfast table, and the living room is a
hodgepodge of books, old coffee cups, plants in various stages of
decrepitude and what looks like a lifetime's worth of detritus.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say that Bayley is a classically eccentric Oxford
don, one of a breed who have always been famously indifferent to
their surroundings. And Bayley is adamant that he doesn't want, or
need, any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would get fussed and bothered if someone came and
did it,'' he said. ``For one thing, they'd want to do it according
to much higher standards.'' He chuckled. ``I really don't see any
point in trying to clear it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, Bayley said, he feels the Iris of today _ the
shuffling, uncomprehending Iris _ is the same Iris he knew before,
the one of the sparkling conversation and the endlessly questioning
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's not only the same person, but it's always been the
same person,'' he explained. ``Though I have a very good memory _ I
can remember where we went and what we did _ I can't remember the
feel of it, you see, the sensation of a person who was completely
normal. It's partly a good thing, because she seems perfectly
normal to me at present.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their long life together, he says, they
are completely entwined, entirely symbiotic. It is a sensation he
relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, we are physically closer,'' Bayley writes in
``Elegy for Iris.'' ``And Iris' little `mouse cry,' as I think of
it, signifying loneliness in the next room, the wish to be back
beside me, seems less and less forlorn, more simple, more natural.
She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the
dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he mean? He tries to explain, as a visitor gets up to
leave and is rewarded by the sudden, sweet flash of a smile across
Miss Murdoch's face and a delighted mumble during a goodbye
embrace. ``You feel that they can't do anything else to you, so to
speak,'' he explained. ``It's a loss of fear.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madame de Pompadour will pay her first visit to New
York next month, and in keeping with her station in life (after
all, she was the mistress of King Louis XV of France), she'll
reside in a Fifth Avenue mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, it won't be the real Jeanne Antoinette Poisson,
Marquise de Pompadour, who was born in 1721 and died in 1764. But
it will be ``Madame de Pompadour,'' Francois-Hubert Drouais'
celebrated full-length portrait of the woman whose influence at
Versailles extended from politics to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, on loan from the National Gallery in London, will
be at the Frick Collection from Jan. 26 through April 25. The
exhibition of the portrait will be accompanied by a display of
complementary paintings from the Frick's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   To Behold
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The focus will be on the eye when Monday arrives at
the World Financial Center Winter Garden, at West Street on the
Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Through Jan. 19, on the floor of the Winter Garden, artists led
by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel, winners of the Rome Prize of
the American Academy, will be assembling ``Oculus,'' a
20-by-40-foot 800,000-piece oval glass and stone mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a Roman mosaicist, Rinaldo Pira, they intend to
create a map of New York City _ intertwined with the continents,
swirling around a central eye _ symbolizing New York as a microcosm
of the world's diverse cultures. In late January the ``Oculus'' is
to be permanently installed in the Park Place IRT subway station,
which is already decorated with hundreds of mosaic eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Musical Menus
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who would like the challenge of a marathon
on New Year's Eve _ albeit a rather sedentary marathon _ the 92nd
Street Y offers the complete piano concertos of Ludwig van
Beethoven, performed by the pianist Anton Kuerti and the Jupiter
Symphony, led by Jens Nygaard. The proceedings begin at 5 p.m.,
with Nos. 2, 3 and 4, break for dinner at 7 p.m. and resume at 9
with the ``Prometheus'' overture, Concerto No. 1 and finally, No.
5, the ``Emperor.'' After that comes a champagne toast to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at Avery Fisher Hall, the three Strausses _ Johann
Sr. and Jr. and Richard _ will be on the New Year's Eve program of
Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic. The vocalists will be the
sopranos Deborah Voigt and Heidi Grant Murphy and the mezzo-soprano
Angelika Kirchschlager. With Beverly Sills as host, PBS will
broadcast the event as a ``Live From Lincoln Center'' attraction.

`AFFLICTION': SUPPRESSED SON ERUPTS WITH MOLTEN EMOTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The powder keg in the small New Hampshire town has a name: Wade
Whitehouse, keeper of the peace. As played with fierce, anguished
intensity by Nick Nolte, who gives the performance of his career in
Paul Schrader's quietly stunning new film, Wade works part time as
Lawford's policeman and knows that his hardest job is policing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But during the devastating course of ``Affliction,'' Wade begins
losing a lifelong struggle with his army of demons, and his
carapace starts to crack. With gut-wrenching pity, the film watches
pressures mount until Wade explodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' is adapted, as ``The Sweet Hereafter'' was, from
a penetratingly astute, grief-tinged novel by Russell Banks, whose
stirring voice is much in evidence here. But its story is also well
suited to Schrader, who finds in Wade's suffering a workaday ``Taxi
Driver'' in the snow. Schrader coaxes forth the oppressive forces
around Wade until they achieve microcosmic fullness, ranging from
childhood beatings by his father to the covert economic rape of a
working-class town. Though ponderous literary voice-overs (from
Willem Dafoe as Wade's brother) provide armchair psychology, the
film is about much subtler signposts on the road to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Forgoing any fanfare beyond the mournful strains of Michael
Brook's score, Schrader has made a film that needs to be watched
carefully. He gives it the deliberate plainness that makes every
small exchange matter. It begins, for instance, with Wade trying to
entertain his doleful little daughter Jill (Brigid Tierney) on
Halloween. As they drive through Lawford, the girl (who is
comfortable with neither the town nor her father) asks Wade if he
ever engaged in Halloween vandalism and says she thinks that he
used to be bad. Forcing the smile that will soon desert him, Wade
tries to give a kindly, fatherly answer, but he can't. The voice of
Wade's own raging father is still too loud.
</P>
<P>
   In a shockingly savage performance, James Coburn rampages
through the film as alcoholic Glen Whitehouse, the man who first
cowed Wade into submission. Jumpy black-and-white flashbacks depict
Glen's viciousness as this family's most fundamental fact of life
and capture the terror of being a small boy at Glen's mercy.
</P>
<P>
   These glimpses of the past are juxtaposed with Wade's habit of
not making waves, either on the job or with the few people who care
about him, unless something pushes him off balance. The first such
shove here: betrayal by Jill, who has her angry mother (Mary Beth
Hurt) come rescue her from Wade's Halloween. ``She never talks
about you,'' Jill says with a shrug to Wade about his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen into a posture of crucifixion as he plays crossing guard
next morning, watching over every child except his own, Wade is
further humiliated by a speeding hotshot in an expensive car. New
money hovers around bleak little Lawford, as personified by this
driver and his father-in-law. The older man, a powerful union
official from Massachusetts, comes to Lawford just for the hunting,
and on that very day is being guided through the woods by Jack
Hewitt (Jim True), a smooth young man whose complacency rankles
Wade. Alone with Jack, the union man is mysteriously killed, and
suddenly Wade is one more inch off balance as he tries to
investigate the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous threat to Wade comes when, after trying to
rekindle his relationship with a sweet, patient waitress named
Margie (Sissy Spacek, luminous as ever), he takes her to his
parents' home and stumbles into an unimaginable nightmare. Glen,
now old and infirm but no less monstrous, is too chronically drunk
to acknowledge the death of his wife upstairs, whom he always
ignored anyway. Though Wade tries, with Margie's help, to deal
sanely with Glen even when it comes to this catastrophe, it's too
late. The son has been drawn within range of his father's
blistering contempt, and finally made to face his long-hidden fury.
This time there will be no getting away.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader guides ``Affliction'' through these momentous events in
a spare, sorrowful spirit that exposes their universality. Like
``The Sweet Hereafter,'' a more meditative and elegant but less
immediate, volcanic film, ``Affliction'' finds the deeper meaning
in an all too believable tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In Wade's story, of the strong trampling the weak and of a man
suppressing every need and impulse until he collapses beneath his
burden, ``Affliction'' succeeds in finding something larger than
one man's misery.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``A Simple Plan,'' ``The General''
and ``A Civil Action,'' it turns dark truthfulness into the
cinematic sentiment most worth celebrating this season.

 &HT;    Readers recall lots of learning in little schools
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have heard from a number of people who regard a
little school as a potential reinforcer and improver of our
educational system.
</P>
<P>
   They are all people, like me, who attended one- or two-room
schools before consolidation hit the land. It's funny that, while
praising the learning they got in small classes, they seem to
remember most the extracurricular activities that went on at the
little country schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   One man called to tell me that bringing drinking water from the
spring was the delight of boys his age. He did not dwell on the
fact that having a dozen or more children drinking from a single
dipper might not have been the best thing for their health, but he
did get a little pleasure from relating how he and his playmates
kept their teacher on her toes by putting frogs in the water
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The schoolchildren themselves drank a lot of water just for the
excitement of fishing frogs out of the bucket, but the teacher took
it hard when a frog leaped out of the dipper and landed on the back
of her neck, sliding down under her dress.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she may have transferred to the nearest consolidated
school with automatic water fountains.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, noting that I called a shade tree in the back yard
our cafeteria at Creola, Ala., grammar school, said she grew up in
rural Georgia and remembers fried rabbit and fried squirrel,
brought from home in blue-striped jelly buckets, as the prime
goodie available to children at the school she attended in Heard
County (GA.).
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke fondly of digging a small hole on the school
grounds, lining it with brown paper, pouring cane syrup brought
from home in the hole and sopping it with a biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   Irene O. Mathews of Gay recalled her daughter's more recent
experience with a small school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building burned and they went to school in an old Army
barracks that had been moved in. Martha Simonton, 97 now and in
Molena Nursing Home, taught 60 pupils with no help. They learned
far beyond what a first-grader learns now and she had no discipline
problem. She would leave them work to do and go across the road to
give her mother her medicine. She told me when she got back, they
were all busy doing what she had told them to do. Can you imagine
that happening now? Can't they see that what they need is good
old-fashioned teachers and discipline?''
</P>
<P>
   She decried so-called ``social promotions'' and quoted a teacher
as telling her a few years ago that students were being graduated
when they couldn't read their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   And also on the educational record of the little school is a
note from a banker who said he learned to spell in grammar school
because the Friday entertainment was a spelling match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to `spell down' all contenders. We actually
prepared for it. I practically memorized the little spelling book
we had and branched out and learned words from The Atlanta
Constitution. I regret to say that my beautiful young secretary,
who attended a bigger, better school, cannot spell anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I have great respect for the old-fashioned spelling match. A few
years ago, I attended a civic club banquet in LaGrange where part
of the entertainment was a spelling bee. You'd be surprised at how
those Rotarians could spell. I seem to recall sitting down on a
tough word like Nebuchadnezzar.
</P>
<P>
   I can blame a country school for not teaching me about that old
king of Babylon, but then the word does not come up often in the
day's work.
</P>

HUMBLING A GREAT ARTIST, WITH MURKY MOTIVATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young instrumentalist of promise, identified in the movie with
a grand post-Romantic concerto, cut down by mental and physical
illness: Haven't we seen this film before? In part, yes. Anand
Tucker's new ``Hilary and Jackie,'' the ``true'' story of the
English cellist Jacqueline du Pre and her elder sister, draws
formulaically on Scott Hicks' ``Shine,'' the 1996 film biography of
the Australian pianist David Helfgott, notably in the way it evokes
a disastrous breakdown in midperformance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are great differences as well, especially in ultimate
effect. Whereas ``Shine'' elevated to the status of genius a
ravaged performer whose talent may never have been huge to begin
with, ``Hilary and Jackie'' seems bent on deflating a great artist
of genuine inspiration to the level of her frustrated sister.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Jacqueline du Pre's nervous breakdown, as enacted by
Emily Watson, has none of the charm of David Helfgott's mental
illness, which yielded mannerisms that were undeniably
entertaining, at least as portrayed by Geoffrey Rush. What the du
Pre story offers instead is sexual titillation, without which, you
can bet, this film would never have seen light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the du Pre story _ the Jackie part, at least _ is well
known. Jacqueline du Pre, who was born in 1945, rose to fame in
England and around the world as a prodigy, swept triumphantly and
glamorously through her early adulthood, married the pianist and
conductor Daniel Barenboim, then fell victim to multiple sclerosis.
She had to stop performing in 1973 and died after years of
immobility in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   What was not widely known until the 1997 publication of ``A
Genius in the Family: An Intimate Memoir of Jacqueline du Pre,'' by
Hilary and Piers du Pre, the cellist's sister and brother, was that
for some nine months in 1971, Jacqueline enjoyed sexual relations
with her sister's husband, Christopher Finzi (played by David
Morrissey), with all parties in the know. The revelation created a
sensation in the English music world, where du Pre is revered.
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as the book is in its venting of petty familial
jealousies, it has virtues over the film. It makes clear, at least,
that the cellist's poaching on her sister's marriage came in the
midst of a serious breakdown, which may in turn have been related
to the onset of her terminal illness. The film tends to blur
chronology even when it is not backtracking, and in this case,
before a breakdown is evident on screen, Jacqueline whispers into
Hilary's ear with seemingly cool calculation that she wants to
sleep with Kiffer, as Finzi is called. In fact, the breakdown can
be read as a fit of petulance after the initial rejection of sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the world needed to know any of this is moot. Hilary du
Pre (Rachel Griffiths) evidently needed to reveal it, despite the
bizarre light it casts on her judgment and that of her husband.
(``Not much had changed,'' she blandly writes of Jacqueline's frame
of mind after long months of home sexual remedies. ``She was still
strongly attached to Kiffer, but he felt her dependence on him
might be a hindrance to her finding her own sense of direction. He
thought he should try and find professional help.'' None too soon,
one might add.)
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps kindest to assume that Hilary du Pre, in revealing
all of this, was acting as an avenging angel. It is hard to believe
that she would have spilled such beans for profit, even if she
could have anticipated a major motion picture contract. But a
reader could not help but suspect at times that Hilary, a pianist
and flutist of some accomplishment, was simply trying to bring her
famous sister down to her own size.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts I knew that Jackie was speeding ahead of
me and I couldn't keep up,'' she writes, and she seems to realize
that she did not really want a globe-hopping lifestyle like her
sister's. Yet she keeps toying with the notion that but for her
mother's favoring of Jacqueline, an encounter with an overbearing
teacher or some other bad break, fortunes might have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Even bereft of a mature career, Jacqueline du Pre was a
world-class talent, one of the finest cellists of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the cellists I've met of this generation, you are the
most interesting,'' said the great older cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich. ``You can go the farthest _ farther than me.''
</P>
<P>
   To an already problematic book, the film adds layers of phony
intimacy and exactitude. It makes much, for instance, of the
sisters' ability to read each other's minds with great literalness,
even, as Jacqueline approaches her end, at considerable distances.
In the book Hilary claims less: ``Within our family, we always knew
exactly what the others were feeling without a word being said,
just as Jackie and I understood each other instinctively.''
</P>
<P>
   The book presents the story alternately through the eyes of one
or the other of Jacqueline's siblings (though Piers du Pre seems
slow to warm to his sister's project), and there is conjecture
aplenty in, for example, the detailed reconstructions of
conversations a quarter-century old. The film, in its backtracking,
pretends to relate the crucial events not only through Hilary's
eyes but also through Jackie's, as though anyone could at this late
date know with any assurance what Jacqueline might have been
thinking as, for example, she toured on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course: art, poetic license and all that. But those are
not the terms in which such information is generally received, as
the Helfgott example showed: The real Helfgott came as a
disappointment to some who might have preferred to encounter Rush's
enactment in the flesh, but the myth of genius persisted in the
public imagination despite the sobering reality of Helfgott's
performances. Viewers not armed with facts in advance tend to take
what appears on screen as fact. And for that matter, shouldn't
history have as much franchise as poetry in a ``true'' story?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Jacqueline du Pre depicted here, who seems to
find little joy in her teeming gifts and regards her career as a
burden, rings untrue to many who knew her well. (Those closest to
du Pre, including Barenboim, declined any comment.) Indeed, it is
questionable how well Hilary, for all her protestations of
intimacy, actually knew Jacqueline in her professional years.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre's own feeling late in life was that ``her parents hadn't
loved her'' and ``her siblings had resented her,'' Carol Easton
reports in ``Jacqueline du Pre: A Biography,'' of 1989. Ms. Easton
is undoubtedly one of those earlier chroniclers whose work is now
reflexively dismissed as hagiography by the exponents of the new
candor. Yet she proves relatively generous in her remarks about
Hilary, who, along with Piers, declined to talk to her, and she
seems straightforward in passing on the views of those who knew de
Pre.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high proportion of musicians will say that she's the most
musically gifted person they've ever encountered,'' Stephen Bishop
Kovacevich, a pianist who teamed with du Pre professionally and
romantically for a time, told Ms. Easton.

   To catch glimpses of that artistry one need only turn to a
series of videos on Teldec, directed by Christopher Nupen and
centered on individual works: the Elgar Cello Concerto, of the
film; Schubert's ``Trout'' Quintet, and Beethoven's ``Ghost'' Trio.
Nupen's affection for the cellist is everywhere apparent, but he
gives more insight into her extravagant artistry _ and for that
matter, her ebullient personality _ in a few minutes than Tucker's
film does in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, of course, there are those wonderful recordings,
including no fewer than three versions of the Elgar concerto. From
her earliest tries, du Pre penetrated to the heart of this autumnal
creation in a way that few of her elders could hope to do. With her
trademark expressiveness and abandon applied to a lush tone, she
defined the work for many listeners and, indeed, for many
performers, some of whom gave it up for good with her passing.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story of the du Pre sisters, meanwhile, is
obvious. In an era when inquiring minds rule and ``everything''
must be revealed, you want to be the one left behind to write the
history. Even then, you may not come off looking very good.

 &HT;    Ventura's biography runs short on charisma
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether you think of him as ``the Body'' or ``the
Mind'' makes no difference. What matters is that in Minnesota,
he'll soon be Jesse ``the Governor'' Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' (8 o'clock E.T.) airs another of
its classic pull-the-punches profiles of a major celebrity, this
one the life story of the hulking pro wrestler, born James Janos in
July 1951, who this year performed a perfect body slam on
Minnesota's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've heard the gist of the tale by now. Wrestling's
Jesse ``the Body'' Ventura (who donned pink tights and boas long
before Dennis Rodman) runs for governor, transforms his image into
Jesse ``the Mind'' Ventura and flat out wins the Guv's Mansion,
besting even Hubert Humphrey's son.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story as perfect as any of pro wrestling's pay-per-view
theatrics. And one that's cool because it's real. We'd say, ``Only
in America,'' but wasn't it Italy that elected a former porn star
to Parliament?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's bio is produced by ABC News Productions for A&AMP;E. And,
frankly, we expected more.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about Ventura's pivotal
death scene in 1987's cinematic testosterone play ``Predator''?
Where's WCW's Bobby ``the Brain'' Heenan talking about Ventura's
verbal prowess as a wrestling commentator?
</P>
<P>
   Too often we get the same old photos _ Ventura the Navy SEAL
with shaved head, Ventura the California Surfin' Wrestler in full
pose, Ventura the high school senior voted best physique _ shown
over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   It's really when Ventura, a one-time biker, bar bouncer and
radio host, starts venturing into politics that this bio starts to
kick butt.
</P>
<P>
   There he is as Brooklyn Park's mayor conducting council meetings
in a T-shirt. There he is at the start of Minnesota's gubernatorial
debate, winking at the camera when his name is announced. There he
is meeting with the public, shaking hands and talking issues at a
booth at the Minnesota State Fair. And there he is, nearly nude,
posing like Rodin's ``The Thinker'' in a political ad proclaiming
him ``The Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is said he likely won the election by meeting the public face
to face and spouting a platform of less government intrusion into
everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so gratifying about this is proving all the so-called
experts wrong,'' Ventura says on his election night.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer the comment about him from retired Navy SEAL Capt.
Larry Bailey: ``Put on the right path, he would excel. Allow him to
go too far the other way, he'd be a mafia don.''

`THE HI-LO COUNTRY': FLAWED RENDITION OF A WILD, CLASSIC WESTERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of the review) 
(rl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a lot of courage nowadays for a director to tackle
anything resembling a classic western. But in adapting Max Evans'
1961 novel, ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' to the screen, that is precisely
what Stephen Frears, the British director of ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' and ``The Grifters,'' has attempted in his wildly
ambitious new film. If the threads of the story ultimately slip
from his grasp, in its best moments the movie feels like an epic
hybrid of ``Red River'' and ``The Last Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the arid cattle country of northeastern New Mexico in the
late 1940s, ``The Hi-Lo Country'' is the story of a friendship
between two young cowboys who, after returning from World War II,
go into the cattle business together. Pete Calder (Billy Crudup),
who narrates the film, is a laconic country boy who dreams of
owning his own cattle ranch. Big Boy Matson (Woody Harrelson), his
best friend and idol, is a gun-toting, whisky-swilling,
rodeo-riding, high-stakes gambling, hooting and hollering live
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Big Boy, who dominates the film, is a role that seems
custom-made for Harrelson's brand of whiplash ferocity. And in a
spectacularly kinetic performance, he whirls and dances through the
part like a man on fire. A spiritual first cousin of the actor's
lethal character in ``Natural Born Killers,'' Big Boy is
charismatic, but he is also more than a little frightening. He's
the kind of person who in a fit of enthusiasm would accidentally
break a few of your ribs while giving you a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' has two big themes it proves unable to
balance. The grander of the two is the changing cattle business and
the friends' struggle against a sinister, wealthy cattle baron
named Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott) who is assimilating all the
region's smaller cattle operations into his growing empire. Pete,
Big Boy and their partner, Hoover Young (James Gammon), are defiant
holdouts against Jim Ed's brand of mechanized agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   The other theme, which ends up taking over the film, is Big
Boy's and Pete's passion for the same woman, Mona (Patricia
Arquette), the sultry redheaded wife of Jim Ed's foreman, Les Birk
(John Diehl). While Pete secretly pines for Mona, Big Boy conducts
an increasingly flagrant affair with her that elicits death threats
and precipitates more than one full-scale bar brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arquette certainly looks right for the role of the
slatternly married siren who tells Pete that, since meeting Big
Boy, for the first time in her life she isn't bored. But for all
the sultry glances she casts, Ms. Arquette fails to convey her
character's fiery animal magnetism. Even when she's in Big Boy's
arms, Ms. Arquette's Mona is more dumb cow than molten lava. And
her absence of erotic energy leaves a blank space in the movie.
While Pete aches for Mona, he turns for solace to his loyal
longtime girlfriend, Josepha O'Neil (Penelope Cruz), to whom he
halfheartedly pledges his love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' spends so much time tracking its
characters' love lives that it loses sight of several crucial minor
characters, of whom the most important is Big Boy's younger
brother, Little Boy (Cole Hauser), who works for the menacing
cattle baron. Because the movie glosses over their embattled
fraternal relationship, the movie's climax, in which the brothers
confront each other, comes almost out of the blue and seems like a
sidetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Walon Green's screenplay tends toward the portentous. Pete's
voice-over speeches often have a stilted, oratorical ring. While
Crudup's Pete is well enough acted, he never emerges as much more
than a brooding observer.
</P>
<P>
   For all its deficiencies and misplaced emphases, ``The Hi-Lo
Country'' still offers plenty of action and color. The movie is
drenched in austere Southwestern atmosphere. You feel the harshness
of the land and feel how physically grueling, dangerous and at the
mercy of the elements a cowboy's life really is.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hi-Lo Country'' is finally an elegy to a vanishing breed
epitomized by Harrelson's electrifying and scary wild man. He is a
creature who is really and truly at home on the range.
</P>

BRUINS NEED TO SHAKE FIRST-PERIOD BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their style has been called stingy at times, even
stingier at others. Whatever terminology one wants to use to label
the way the Bruins play, perhaps the best description of the
tactics employed by coach Pat Burns is ``defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins have been successful, it has been because they
hold their opponents off the scoreboard for long stretches,
especially early in the game, and take advantage of errors when
they start to press. Well, at least that was the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It has gone wickedly awry in the last two games. The Bruins have
staked their foes to two and three goals, respectively, in the
first period and the results have been predictable: losses on both
fronts, in New York Saturday night to the Islanders (4-2) and to
the Capitals Monday night (5-1). The loss to Washington was the
team's third straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are halfway through a four-game road trip, and so far
their fortunes have been dismal. With Nashville on tap Wednesday
night and Dallas on deck Thursday, the journey could get even worse
if something doesn't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our starts,'' lamented goalie Byron Dafoe, who was
peppered with 18 shots in the first period and 37 overall by
Washington. ``Our first periods have just been not strong at all.
It's been our worst period of hockey every game for the past seven
or eight games. I don't think we've held a team off the board in
the first period the last seven or eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year, we'd go the first half of the game
without allowing a goal. That's partly my fault. I have got to
start coming up with bigger saves and as a team we have to bear
down more.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Dafoe hasn't been playing badly. The same can't
be said for many of the forwards, who have been running around in
their own zone, looking as if they weren't sure what to do. The
defensemen have been only marginally better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and name a bunch of names,'' said
Burns, though when asked specifically about Sergei Samsonov, the
coach conceded that the sophomore left wing has struggled mightily
the last two times out. ``He's not alone. There is a whole cast and
crew of guys who didn't show up, old and young. Washington
outhustled us, that's all. It's as simple as that. They were first
on the puck, we were second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have been putting themselves behind the 8-ball right
off the bat. Against the Islanders, they were in a deficit just
6:57 into the game. It was worse Monday night when the Capitals
scored at the 24-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting the breaks right now,'' said Dafoe. ``We've
talked about getting good starts, and 24 seconds in, the thing goes
off my head and my back and in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're struggling when we're behind, 1-0, early.
It's something we have to focus on. You can't make excuses and say
we're not having good luck but we definitely aren't getting the
breaks we were earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 18 shots and they definitely came to play. They've
been struggling and there's no reason why we would get outshot,
18-8, in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got to take a serious look at ourselves and try to
figure out what's going on here. The games don't get any easier.
We've got to dig deep and try to salvage what we've got left of it.
Nashville is playing great and then we have back to back with
Dallas. If we play like we did (against Washington), we're going to
get absolutely spanked.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Dave Ellett said it's too tall an order to
expect a club, especially the Bruins, to rally from deficits time
and time again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, you can't win on the road by giving up two or
three goals in the first period,'' Ellett said. ``We're not a
come-from-behind team. We have to be ready from the start of the
game. We can't afford to give teams easy goals or fall behind
early. For this team to be successful, we have to be within one
goal or ahead or tied after the first. We don't make many mistakes
and we don't give up many chances but these last two games have
been totally out of our character.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was bad news on the injury front Tuesday. Chris Taylor
bruised his shoulder in practice and is questionable for Wednesday,
as is Ken Belanger, who has a sore neck. The Bruins called up
forwards Landon Wilson and Cameron Mann from Providence for the
rest of the trip.

 &HT;    Inspections detail 'filthy' conditions, security problems in
Georgia prison
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's first privately-run prison _ open a little
more than two months _ had lax security and ``filthy'' conditions
in some areas during two recent state inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The warden and a executive from Cornell Corrections Inc., which
opened the medium-security private prison in Folkston, Ga. in
mid-October, said they had addresses the criticisms in reports of
two inspection visits and attributed the problems to kinks in the
system of any new prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes time,'' said Gary Henman, Cornell vice president
for secure institutions. ``We received inmates very quickly, at our
request. We brought them in twice as fast as we originally
scheduled. It was like the horse catching up with the cart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 500 prisoners in the D. Ray James State Prison
in Charlton County, Henman said Tuesday. The maximum number of
inmates the Legislature has committed to sending to the prison, 750
men, will be reached in mid 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two reports _ one written after an inspection Nov. 18-19 and
another after a Dec. 9 visit _ said there were security lapses,
sloppy record-keeping and poor tracking of inmates. On some days,
officers assigned to cell blocks did not know how many inmates were
to be in the areas they were supervising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received a commitment to make sure they are going to
start running thinks like a state prison,'' said Jennifer
Sargenson, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, which has
a contract with Cornell Corrections Inc. to send inmates to the D.
Ray James State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be embarrassed, and they don't want to
embarrass us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Warden Lowell Hudson said he had been transferred to open a
Cornell prison in California, and insisted his move was routine,
having nothing to do with the critical report. ``I'm going to do
bigger and better things for Cornell,'' Hudson said. ``Cornell is
expanding like a son of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of three private prisons to open in Georgia this year,
the Cornell facility was three months late taking prisoners because
of construction delays. Each day without an inmate is a day of
profits lost for the Houston-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, as well as the federal prison system and several
states, have turned to corporate America to incarcerate it's
criminals because they think it will save money. DOC claims
privately run prisons save taxpayers money. Cornell is billing
Georgia taxpayers $45.13 per inmate per day, about $13 a day less
than the cost at state-run prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say concern for profit carries more weight that
concern for security, and the results can be dangerous, such as in
Ohio where five dangerous men from Washington, D.C., escaped from a
CCA prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``All decisions made inside these prisons is based on what
shareholders want,'' said Brian Dawe, director of operations for
Corrections USA, a non-profit lobby for prison guards. ``In private
prisons, the only pros are the cons. You have inexperience staff,
undertrained and undermanned. You have people sworn to protect the
bottom line instead of public safety. . . ``It's corporate welfare.
. . and no one's been minding the roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Folkston Mayor Dixie McGurn said she is not worried, even though
she was unaware of the critical report.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, we have had no problems with the prison,''
McGurn said. ``I'm sitting here a little dumbfounded. I've not
heard any of this. But I feel like if the Department of Corrections
has come down here and their monitors have seen these problems, it
will be taken care of. If it's a major problem, I feel like we have
a right to know. But it's not like they have inmates crawling over
the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Corp. of America of Nashville also has contracts to
operate medium-security prisons in Wheeler and Coffee counties, and
those facilities have been taking about 50 inmates weekly since
Dec. 1. CCA charges $48.10 per inmate per day, and there are about
330 inmates combined in the two CCA Georgia prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The state has agreed to lease 750 beds at the two CCA prisons
and the CCI operation in Folkston, but the companies will expand
their institutions to eventually hold about 1,600 each, with the
hope that Georgia will also want to fill those cells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CCA, the nation's largest private prison company, has
announced plans to build a $45 million prison for more than 1,000
inmates in Telfair County even though it has no formal agreement
with Georgia to lease those spaces to the state. CCA officials and
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry Coleman (D-Eastman),
who represents the area, said there is an understanding with the
state, while DOC Commissioner Wayne Garner insists there have been
no negotiations.

 &HT;    Conversion to euro fostering anxiety
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm OK, euro OK,'' reads the motto on a T-shirt distributed by
Netherlands-based banking giant ABN Amro. But a lot of people are
keeping their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   The first swarm of euro conversions, a near-relation to the
millennium bug, will arrive Jan. 4. Many analysts believe the euro
changeover will provide an unpalatable foretaste of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based consultancy,
estimates the euro conversion will cost $150 billion to $400
billion in the European Union alone, an estimate that does not
include PCs and packaged software.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates suggest the rest of world will spend tens of
billions on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   And not least, the changeover to the euro has diverted lots of
time and money from Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., for example, said it will have to
convert all its information technology systems, recalculate
currency risks, modify its processes for preparing taxes, payroll
and customer records, among other things. Coke does business in all
of the countries involved in the conversion and has been preparing
for it for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well prepared to handle the issues surrounding the
introduction of the euro,'' said spokesman Bill Hensel. ``It's
going to impact more on our bottlers and even more on our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the retail level, he said, stores will have to list two
prices for all products during the phase-in period, as well as
maintaining two cash drawers for both types of currency.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange rates in relation to the euro will be set at the
European Union headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday.
There are 11 participating countries: the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Finland,
Ireland and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece are members of the
European Union but not members of the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the rates are set, financial institutions will have to
scramble to adjust their software to convert a spectrum of
financial products into euros before businesses open four days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Year 2000 problem, you simply change a date. But with
the euro, you're also dealing with a perception issue. It's akin to
people who think in inches and feet having to think in terms of
centimeters and meters,'' said Adelbert Spaan, vice president and
euro marketing manager for ABN Amro, North America in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of perceptual problems, ``you may have to add new
fields that display the euro alongside the legacy currency. An
example: You used to show deutsche marks in a given monetary field.
Now you want to show both deutsche marks and euros to familiarize
users with the relationship between the old currency and the new,''
said Jonathan Rende, product marketing manager for Mercury
Interactive in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, the euro conversion has been
complicated and expensive. Spaan said his company, which has $400
billion in assets and offices in 72 countries, will spend more than
$350 million on the euro and far less, $175 million, on Y2K.

 &HT;    Atlanta-based tech companies a mixed bag for investors in '98
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Along with their national counterparts, some local
tech companies brought their investors serious money during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Those that performed well, like MindSpring Enterprises and ISS
Group, did so by aggressively increasing market share and by
operating in a hot industry, the Internet, which saw dramatically
increasing numbers of users this year.
</P>
<P>
   But sheer growth did not guarantee success, as Harbinger
discovered. The stock of the electronic commerce software firm
suffered as the company struggled to fold the companies it acquired
into its corporate mix.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MindSpring Enterprises, the southeast's largest
Internet access provider, are up 515 percent over last Dec. 30
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick W. Moran, an analyst with ING Barings, said 1998 was
the year Atlanta-based MindSpring, ``burst on the scene by
developing one of the leading ISPs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the year when not only did they get recognition
nationally by the consumer, but also by the institutional
investment community, which rewarded their shares handsomely,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said two things fueled much of MindSpring's growth: a 10
percent price hike in April by America Online, America's largest
ISP with 17 million subscribers, and MindSpring's purchase, from
AOL in October, of 180,000 subscribers. Overall, MindSpring's
subscriber base grew 150 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said 1999 will continue the battle between MindSpring,
with 700,000 subscribers, and EarthLink Network, with 1 million, to
be the nation's second largest ISP. He expects MindSpring to be
trading at $111 in 12 months. It closed Tuesday at $68.
</P>
<P>
   ISS Group, a network security software firm, went public in
March. Its shares have climbed 153 percent since.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ISS Group are up 38 percent in the last five days,
closing Tuesday at $56.25. Barry Glasgow, an analyst with LaSalle
Street Securities, said 1999 will be a big year for ISS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 1999 is the year for security stocks,'' he said. ``Y2K
has been holding people back from making buying decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But local tech-stock news was not all good. Premiere
Technologies was down 75 percent. The company sells communications
service devices, one of which ties Internet e-mail to voice mail
and conference calling.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of CheckFree are up 122 percent, to $21.93 3/4, since
Sept. 30, but are down 26 percent for the year. CheckFree is one of
a handful of companies hoping to make the Web the place where you
get and pay your bills.
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger, which bought 12 companies in 30 months, is down 62
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael G. Chung, an analyst with Williams Capital Group, said
Harbinger's attempt to integrate companies it acquired led to its
sluggish 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A 41 percent drop in share price in one day, Oct. 1, led to
drastic changes. Co-founder C. Tycho Howle was brought back, 10
percent of the workforce was trimmed and half the product line was
cut. The stock, which had sunk to $4.06 Oct. 2, has since
rebounded, closing Tuesday at $8.

 &HT;    Gambling on future of TV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lanky 58, James McDonald looks like a long distance
runner and, at least in the way he's run Scientific-Atlanta, he is.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief executive, McDonald has pushed this
Atlanta-based maker of television equipment to chase the promise of
digital interactive TV that glimmers on a distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   He saw this technology, although considered a risky bet by some
of his counterparts, as the company's great chance to leap ahead of
its main competitor, General Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to see the potential of digital technology
five years ago,'' says McDonald. ``Now everyone sees it. Given what
we've invested and built, Scientific-Atlanta has a significant
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   That lead, however, is currently in a race no one else is yet
running.
</P>
<P>
   A problem for Scientific-Atlanta in the short term is that it
accelerated hard toward such items as digital set-top boxes, such
as in its Explorer 2000 digital cable networks. They enable cable
operators to offer customers such things as digital television,
more channels, interactive on-screen TV guides and high-speed
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta somewhat overestimated the immediate demand
for the devices when the Telecommunications Act passed in 1996. So
far, many customers are taking their time making decisions on the
timing for going all-digital. While Scientific-Atlanta probably
guessed right about the long-term need for its digital technology,
potential customers have hesitated to move that way.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company is moving ahead smartly in the
development of digital cable network ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Explorer 2000 is shipping and already has 15 big customers,
including Atlanta-based Cox Communications. Scientific-Atlanta made
97,000 Explorer 2000 set-top boxes in the second quarter, shipping
57,000 of those.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reg Griffin, the Atlanta spokesman for MediaOne, said
his company is still testing digital boxes in Detroit and elsewhere
and has not established a firm timetable for introducing them to
the Atlanta market.
</P>
<P>
   Will Explorer 2000 pick up momentum fast enough to justify the
company's huge investment over the past six years in digital
technology? Some say it's too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonald is a great visionary, but has he executed well?''
asks George Hunt, a media analyst who covers the company for
Interstate/Johnson Lane. ``That's still up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   If McDonald is worried about his strategy, he doesn't show it.
Curly-haired and slightly balding, McDonald smiles easily. He
explains the reasons behind his strategy with confidence and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fight technology,'' explains McDonald. ``We knew it
was only a matter of time before the cost of digital services would
come down to the point where they become affordable to a mass
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald has not come by his self-assuredness easily. He is no
stranger to adversity. The native Kentuckian spent 21 years at IBM,
many of them as a troubleshooter. Later, he was president of
software maker Prime Computer as it struggled to restructure itself
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a 35-year career in technology and have worked
through most of the kinds of jobs there are in the industry,'' says
McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences have taught McDonald that you must gamble big
to win in hi-tech businesses. He has done that on digital
television with Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, his major competitor, General Instrument, has taken
an opposite approach. It chose to build an inexpensive set-top box
that serves cable TV's current analog systems. The strategy has
paid off big, with General Instrument selling more than two million
of those boxes. ``They've sold the heck out of them,'' says Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, says McDonald, but he hints that General Instrument
has been caught sleeping by not investing in a true digital two-way
technology like Scientific-Atlanta. He maintains that, by investing
in digital technology, his company now has a significant lead in
this important new market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're there too early or too late with a new technology,
you lose,'' says McDonald. ``Most people see things coming but
don't get the timing right.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the timing right wasn't easy for Scientific-Atlanta.
Indeed, McDonald led his company on a six-year journey through the
wilderness to reach this day. That journey began in 1992, when
Scientific-Atlanta signed up to produce the digital network that
powered Time Warner Cable's experimental two-way system in Orlando,
Fla. That system was ridiculed by critics as too expensive and
impractical. ``We got beat up bad,'' says McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   That drubbing prompted most other cable operators to kill
interactive tests of their own. McDonald, though, didn't give up
and searched for another partner in testing his digital technology.
That led to a series of trials with the cable industry's
arch-rival, the telephone companies: BellSouth, US West, PacTel and
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the telephone companies too lost faith in two-way
digital TV technology, at least in the near term. ``They got burnt
and eventually gave up on it,'' says McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the telephone companies cooled on digital
technology, cable rediscovered it. McDonald re-enlisted
Scientific-Atlanta as a major industry player.
</P>
<P>
   For Scientific-Atlanta, investing in digital technology has been
expensive in terms of both research and forgone earnings pumped
back into the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carried our digital technology efforts five years without
revenue,'' says McDonald. ``Our earnings and stock would be higher
if we had not invested in digital technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta has not established a consistent profit
picture over the last decade, experienceing a loss year in 1996.
But the company has seen profits climb over the last two fiscal
years, ending in June, showing a profit of $80.8 million on
revenues of $1.2 billion in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company's stock has traded between $11.75 and
$27.93 a share, with the price hovering recently around $22.
</P>
<P>
   While he considers the company's stock undervalued, McDonald has
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company like ours has to invest in research and
development,'' he says. ``Value for us is driven by catching a ride
on the next big wave in technology, offering the right product at
the right time.''

CALIF. ATTORNEY GENERAL-ELECT BACKS LEGALIZED MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Democratic Attorney General-elect Bill Lockyer has
unrolled a list of priorities that bear little resemblance to those
set by his Republican predecessor, Dan Lungren, during his two
terms.
</P>
<P>
   While Lungren focused almost exclusively on crime and
punishment, Lockyer's list of 12 key issues includes passing an
enforceable ban on assault weapons and beefing up civil rights and
environmental and consumer protections. He wants to reform the
death penalty appeals process, curb school violence and regulate
the state's gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   As his 10th priority, Lockyer promises to focus on legalizing
the use of medical marijuana in the wake of Proposition 215, the
1996 initiative that was intended to allow seriously ill patients
to grow and use marijuana for pain relief with a doctor's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has largely failed because of efforts made
through the courts by Lungren and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockyer says he wants to make Prop. 215 work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means cooperating with local communities if they have
different approaches. So San Francisco would be different than Kern
County,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue highlights one of the bigger differences between
Lockyer and Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Many marijuana clubs around the state, including the
9,000-member Cannabis Healing Center here, have been shut down
since the passage of Prop. 215 through Lungren's efforts and those
of the Clinton administration's Justice Department, seeking to
enforce federal laws against marijuana distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Lungren) was overly zealous in continuing to oppose
(Prop. 215), even after the people had adopted it,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the role of the attorney general, Lockyer
acknowledged he can be a powerful force in supporting crime
legislation and that his office has a huge role in handling
criminal appeals. In the end, however, the job has limited
influence over actual street crime and the criminal courtrooms, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is perhaps Dan Lungren felt like he was the pinnacle
of the law-enforcement community, and I see my role as more of a
support service for local DAs and local law enforcement,'' said
Lockyer, who takes office Monday. ``Of course, in four years I hope
to run ads taking credit for all the fine work they do, which is
what attorneys general tend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign leading up to his election in November,
Lockyer, a longtime Democratic lawmaker from Hayward, Calif., was
strongly attacked by his Republican opponent, Dave Stirling, a
conservative former judge and chief deputy attorney general.
Stirling portrayed Lockyer as a squishy liberal who may have smoked
pot. He said Lockyer would likely cause the crime rate to soar.
</P>
<P>
   But voters picked Lockyer over Stirling by 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   While Lockyer will face many unresolved issues, including 50,000
ongoing lawsuits and criminal appeals, among the biggest will be
dealing with Prop. 215.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,000-member California Narcotics Officers Association
endorsed Stirling and differs with Lockyer on medical marijuana.
Christy McCampbell, president of the association, said she has met
with Lockyer, found him to be interested in her work and says she
thinks the Stirling endorsement can be put behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be kind of a learning experience, all
the way around,'' she said. ``He's learning a new position, and we
really don't want to be involved in the politics. Our membership is
trying to do a job and trying to uphold the laws on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Although medical marijuana distribution centers have now gone
underground, supporters were buoyed last month when five states _
Arizona, Nevada, Alaska, Washington and Oregon _ approved statutes
similar to California's.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer, whose mother and a sister died of leukemia, supported
Prop. 215. During his campaign he said he wants ``clinics, not
cults.'' He has appointed a task force that includes state Sen.
John Vasconcellos, a San Jose Democrat, and Santa Clara County
District Attorney George Kennedy, to find ways to make Prop. 215
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change from Lungren is potentially very significant,''
said Dave Fratello, spokesman for Americans for Medical Rights.
``Lockyer has said he understands the conflict we have with federal
law and would like to see this initiative work. And he has even
said he would support regulated distribution of marijuana, as long
as there were safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Fratello said 1999 could bring efforts to set up an official
registry, perhaps in the state Department of Health, so that
medical marijuana users could show police an identification card if
they are stopped. There may be a move to determine exactly how much
marijuana is appropriate per patient.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer has asked Gov.-elect Gray Davis for $25 million in extra
funding over last year's budget to hire more attorneys in some
departments and to strengthen the state's crime labs.
</P>
<P>
   He marvels that the attorney general's supercomputer processes
about 1.5 million local law enforcement inquiries a day. He'll go
from having 50 employees in the Senate, where he was president pro
tem, to 5,000 as attorney general.

JAPANESE BANKS RAISING MORTGAGE RATES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TOKYO _ Five major Japanese banks announced Wednesday that they
would raise mortgage rates by as much as 8/10 of a percentage point
next month, the first sign that soaring interest rates here will
squeeze the already embattled Japanese consumer. One bank had
already raised its rates.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, which were at historic low levels earlier this
year, have recently been rising as the government sinks deeper and
deeper into debt while trying to lift the economy out of recession
with expensive stimulus measures.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
closed higher again Tuesday, at 1.865 percent, an increase of more
than 1 percentage point since it hit a record low of 0.695 percent
in October. Rates are still well below those in the United States,
however. For example, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note
fell to 4.67 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday, the government was celebrating a 2 percent rise in
consumer spending in November compared with the month a year
earlier, driven largely by sales of personal computers. That was
the first jump in consumer spending in five months, but higher
mortgage rates are virtually certain to dampen any trend that might
have been emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most existing housing loans here are fixed rate and thus won't
be affected by this,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, the chief
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ``But it's
psychologically important because it will have a negative effect on
those who might have been thinking about building or buying a house
and all of the subsequent spending that accompanies those
activities'' such as buying appliances and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Sakura Bank announced Monday that it would raise rates on
10-year mortgages by 3/4 of a percentage point, to 3.95 percent,
and Tuesday it was joined by Fuji Bank, Sanwa Bank, the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Sumitomo Bank, which all
raised their rates to levels between 3.8 percent and 4.05 percent.
Other financial institutions are likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is not a widely used comparable 10-year rate in
the United States, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate
mortgage was 6.41 percent last week.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Raising interest rates in the midst of the worst recession since
World War II seems counterintuitive. Japanese banks, however, are
struggling to clean up their balance sheets by reducing their
assets, and higher interest rates help in that process.
</P>
<P>
   The Construction Ministry, on the other hand, has apparently
been pushing a plan to ease the terms of housing loans that will
interfere with that effort. Earlier this month, the ministry
ordered the Housing Loan Corp. to revise its terms in various ways,
including extending repayment periods by 10 years and offering
borrowers zero percent interest for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The government is now worried that financial institutions will
force mortgage holders in both the private and corporate sectors to
increase payments using the money saved through the revised terms,
according to the Tokyo Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's plans will increase the portion of questionable
loans held by banks, Feldman said. ``That's exactly what the banks
don't need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility, of course, that mortgage rates will
drop just as quickly as they have risen. The yield on 10-year
Japanese government bonds is expected to be 1.3 percent at the end
of the fiscal year March 31, according to the average estimate of
nine economists based in Japan who were surveyed by Bloomberg News.
In other words, they expect prices to rise and yields to fall over
the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldman thinks Japan's higher interest rates are likely to
remain as long as the economy continues to flounder. He said
investors, particularly large Japanese institutions, were avoiding
longer-term investments in favor of shorter-term investments,
seeking ever-greater liquidity and more limited exposure to Japan's
economic troubles.

TWO KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS APOLOGIZE TO CAMBODIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ A top leader of the Khmer Rouge muttered
an apology Tuesday, saying he was ``sorry, very sorry'' for the
suffering he had caused the Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
   His apology, in English, came only after aggressive questioning
at a news conference. At the insistence of Cambodian reporters, he
repeated it in the Khmer language: ``Knyom som tos.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leader, Khieu Samphan, repeatedly urged Cambodians and
foreigners to ``let bygones be bygones'' regarding the deaths of
more than a million people between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer
Rouge ruled Cambodia and he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan, 67, who was welcomed back to society on Tuesday
with an embrace from Prime Minister Hun Sen and a trip to Phnom
Penh with accommodations at a luxury hotel, said Cambodia should
focus on the problems of the present and ``forget the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A second high-ranking defector, Nuon Chea, 71, was also asked if
he had an apology to make to his countrymen. ``Actually, we are
very sorry not only for the lives of the people of Cambodia, but
even for the lives of all animals that suffered because of the
war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cambodians said the remark reflected a Buddhist pacifist
theology. They also noted that Nuon Chea referred specifically to
Cambodia's long civil war, not to the ravages of the Khmer Rouge
rule, when nearly a fourth of the country's population was killed
or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Brother No. 2'' to the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, Nuon Chea was the architect of the movement's brutal forced
evacuation of the cities in 1975. He later had command
responsibility over a wave of purges in which many thousands of
people were tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Khmer Rouge were indeed responsible for large
numbers of deaths, he said: ``Please leave this to history. This is
an old story. Please leave it to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan was similarly circumspect on the question of
guilt, muttering at one point, ``To say who is wrong and who is
right and who is doing this and who is doing that, et cetera,'' and
then rephrasing: ``The developments of history in our country are
very complicated. Please don't keep stirring things up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had listened Tuesday to a foreign radio broadcast in
which Cambodians had described the losses of family members at the
hands of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is normal that those who have lost their families, that
they _ what to say _ feel some resentment,'' he said, speaking in
English. ``But I feel that most of our compatriots understand that
we have much more problems to resolve at the present and in the
future and we have to forget the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ```Let bygones be bygones' is the best solution for
our country, because it is the only way to reach national
reconciliation. It is the sine qua non condition for peace and
stability in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge leader himself,
said the same thing on Monday in somewhat less high-flown language:
``We should dig a hole and bury the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his past assurances that he wanted and would assist in
setting up a tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against
humanity, Hun Sen said on Monday that those who surrendered should
be greeted ``with bouquets of flowers, not with prisons and
handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were indeed greeted with bouquets at their hotel
Tuesday, a diplomat said work was continuing at the United Nations
to lay the groundwork for any possible future trial.
</P>
<P>
   The surrenders by Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea virtually complete
the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement, a process that began more
than two years ago with widening defections. Only one major figure,
the battlefield commander Ta Mok, has not given up or been welcomed
back by the government. Virtually all of his guerrilla fighters are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Khieu Samphan mostly maintained his
smile, but he was clearly distressed by a drumbeat of harsh
questions. Would he at least tell the Cambodian people he was sorry
for their suffering, a foreign reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, barely audibly. ``Sorry, very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, a Cambodian human rights worker could hardly
contain himself. ``Sorry is enough? Enough? I want to beat these
guys up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Cambodian reporter shushed him.
</P>
<P>
   But later the reporter, who had earlier said he agreed with Hun
Sen's policy of forgiveness and national reconciliation, said he
could not hold down a surge of fury when the two Khmer Rouge
leaders arrived at a luxury hotel in their chauffeured sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them, it is difficult to forgive _ very
difficult,'' said the reporter, who lost most of his family during
the Khmer Rouge years. ``It is just like waking me up when I see
them. But we have to forgive and move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two elderly leaders, who gave up their struggle four days
ago, flew here Tuesday morning by helicopter from the western town
of Pailin, where they have begun new lives as self-proclaimed
``ordinary citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   They were treated to lunch by Hun Sen before being driven to
their hotel, where a manager said they and their families had been
booked in by the Defense Ministry at a corporate rate of $105,
including breakfast. The manager said welcome baskets of fruit and
flowers had been placed in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were joined at the lunch by Ieng Sary, the former
Khmer Rouge foreign minister, who defected more than two years ago.
He is the chieftain of Pailin, which has become an enclave for the
defecting killers.
</P>
<P>
   When a small group of Cambodian photographers were allowed to
take pictures of their meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday
morning, the photographers said they were instructed in a
threatening manner not to publish any photographs of a handshake or
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea arrived in the capital in a strange
political vacuum _ indeed, a vacuum of reality _ unnoticed and
unremarked as the daily life of this threadbare city surged around
them. Their defection and coming visit had been reported in the
local press, although their schedule was not disclosed in advance.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first visit here by Nuon Chea since Khmer Rouge
times, when Phnom Penh was a dead city, emptied of its citizens by
his absolutist theory of a primitive agrarian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   He walked slowly, using a polished and ornamented wood cane,
looking straight ahead and saying little.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan, one of the movement's chief diplomats, had dyed
his white hair a rich chestnut brown and seemed to want to exude a
suave urbanity. But as he left the heated news conference,
surrounded by jostling, shouting reporters and struggling security
men, his smile became fixed and even terrified.

<P>
   CHELSEA, Mich. _ Gasoline prices have plunged and sport utility
vehicle sales are soaring, yet many of the world's biggest
automakers plan to introduce fuel-sipping small-car models in the
United States in the coming months. Are they crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The interest in small cars is partly driven by
regulations _ automakers need to sell a lot of small cars to avoid
violating federal fuel-economy laws. The coming surge is also
partly a coincidence, as many automakers happen to have completed
new designs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the new models reflect a shift in how
automakers, particularly U.S. and Japanese automakers, look at
small cars. Disappearing are the economy boxes of even two or three
years ago, with their tiny wheels, plastic bumpers and sometimes
gaudy paint schemes. In their place will be more expensive models
that look and perform like shorter versions of midsize cars.
</P>
<P>
   The new small cars will also have almost as much interior room
as midsize models, thanks to higher roofs and clever designs.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for building small cars that look like undersized
Ford Tauruses is that a greater number of older, more affluent
Americans are buying them. They expect better comfort and
amenities. Younger buyers, meanwhile, are increasingly turning to
used cars and sport utility vehicles instead.
</P>
<P>
   The older buyers include people like Paul Wishnow, a 65-year-old
antiques appraiser in Houston. He has owned a huge, black Chrysler
New Yorker sedan for years but bought a new, metallic gray Plymouth
Neon small sedan last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parking is convenient and mileage is great,'' Wishnow said.
``My kids are all gone, and it basically just works for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent success of Volkswagen AG's New Beetle, which starts
at $16,425, has also reminded executives that small cars can be
profitable after all. At the same time, the huge excess of
small-car factories in South Korea and elsewhere in emerging
markets, capable of producing extremely cheap cars, has left U.S.
and Japanese automakers despairing of profits at the very bottom
end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ford Motor Co. stopped selling two of its smallest
cars, the Aspire and the spartan Ford Probe.
</P>
<P>
   Another important reason for selling plusher small cars lies in
the growth of the late-model used-car market, as ever more 2- and
3-year-old cars come on the market at the end of leases.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between a stripped-down small car and a similarly
priced, late-model, midsize car with lots of options, more
Americans have been choosing the used car. Falling gasoline prices
have removed what little financial incentive remained for
cash-strapped young buyers to choose a no-frills small car instead
of a bigger, older model.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are choosing to move to the used vehicle
rather than buy a smaller car, so what we're seeing is a very weak
market for small cars, and the very small cars have virtually gone
out of business,'' said John F. Smith Jr., General Motors Corp.'s
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Every big automaker seems to have drawn the same conclusion _
that the future lies in somewhat larger and more expensive small
cars, typically costing $13,000 to $17,500. The danger for
automakers is that it may be only a matter of time before profit
margins in this niche also evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   This could come sooner rather than later if automakers start
cutting prices so as to maintain sales and improve their overall
compliance with federal fuel-economy laws. And Korean automakers
are also moving to develop ever more attractive models, so the
overhang of capacity for bare-bones economy cars costing less than
$11,000 could spread to the larger small cars.
</P>
<P>
   Midsize car prices are actually creeping down now, as automakers
pass along the savings from manufacturing improvements. But even
though the costs of manufacturing small cars are dropping even
faster, as automakers rely on mostly nonunion suppliers to assemble
ever larger chunks of vehicles, the prices that consumers pay for
small cars are likely to edge up by a few hundred dollars over the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are taking all their manufacturing savings on small
cars and spending the money and more on making small cars fancier,
rather than cheaper. None of the new small cars have been priced so
far, including the new Neon sedan, which Chrysler recently
displayed at its highly guarded test track here, 55 miles west of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the industry's consensus is that automakers that do not
upgrade their small cars will end up with few sales, which will
help neither profits nor compliance with fuel-economy laws. ``They
have to be good to sell,'' said James Hall, an analyst with Auto
Pacific Inc., a consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif. ``There was
a time when being small was good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry's new emphasis on costlier small cars will be
evident at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in
early January. Ford will be promoting its new Focus, which will
replace the aging Escort. DaimlerChrysler AG will be showing off
the completely redesigned Dodge and Plymouth Neon, which is
becoming a taller, sportier small car.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota will introduce the Echo, which will replace the
diminutive Tercel while having almost as much interior room as the
Corolla. Honda plans to roll out a prototype for its next small
car. And GM will show off several prototypes as it continues to
work on substitutes for the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire.
</P>
<P>
   What all these small cars have in common is that they are more
spacious than the cars they replace.
</P>
<P>
   The new Ford Focus, for example, does not just have more
headroom, legroom and shoulder room than the Ford Escort it
replaces. It is also bigger in all three critical interior measures
than the Ford Contour, the next-larger sedan in Ford's inventory.
Yet the overall length of the Focus is similar to an Escort and
nearly a foot shorter than a Contour.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford insists that the Focus only succeeds the Escort, a
Ford manager who insisted on anonymity said that the automaker had
already begun planning to convert its Contour factory in Kansas
City, Mo., to the production of sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers typically sit slightly higher off the road in the new
models, and automakers hope that this will also reassure buyers
about safety. The manufacturers' own research reveals that many
drivers are more nervous about driving small vehicles as big sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks become ever more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the trucks and SUVs on the road now, people want to
sit a little higher,'' Ernest Laginess, DaimlerChrysler's executive
engineer for the Neon's body said as he rode in the new Neon at the
Chrysler test track here.
</P>
<P>
   As small cars move upscale, automakers face a problem in
persuading buyers to spend a little more for them. The response has
been to undertake particularly drastic redesigns and to rename
cars, as Ford and Toyota are doing, in the hope that shoppers will
forget the older, cheaper models.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In its styling, ``the Focus is definitely not an Escort,'' Hall,
the analyst, said. ``If you call it an Escort, you set expectations
for pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   And many small-car buyers can afford to pay higher prices. In
1990, for example, the best-selling small car was the Ford Escort,
which typically went for about $9,600, or $11,958 in today's
dollars. The best-selling small car this year is the Honda Civic EX
sedan, which sells for $17,145 _ although the Civic has become so
large that by some definitions it no longer qualifies as a small
car.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has found that 70 percent of its Neon buyers now
live in households owning one or more other new vehicles, most
often a Chrysler minivan. The original Neon in 1994 was sold in
bright pastel colors like ``nitrous green,'' intended to lure
20-something buyers. By contrast, the all-new Neon going on sale in
February will be sold in colors like silver and deep cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   The median target age for the new vehicle is 39 _ Chrysler
actually anticipates that roughly half the buyers will be in their
40s, 50s and 60s and only half will be the young people for whom
the original Neon was designed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of these new small cars will have to be shoehorned
into a shrinking market. Sales in the United States have slid
steadily to about 2 million this year from 2.77 million small cars
in 1993; within this category, sales of the smallest, cheapest cars
have plunged in the same period to 152,000 from 518,000.
</P>
<P>
   But small cars remain the biggest segment of the auto market in
the rest of the world. This allows automakers to spread the design
and engineering costs of new small-car models across many more
vehicles. Indeed, Ford has already begun selling the Focus in
Europe. DaimlerChrysler hopes to export close to 40,000 Neons
annually, but its ambitious redesign of the vehicle is only aimed
at maintaining sales in the United States at 200,000 or so a year.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives also view small cars as a way to reassure
Washington that they have not lost interest in fuel economy even as
sales soar for high-profit, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``By improving fuel economy, we fend off legislative or
regulatory improvements in fuel economy, and that's a reason to do
it, obviously,'' said Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, developing small cars represents an insurance
policy against the possibility that gasoline prices may someday
rise again to a level at which they seriously influence Americans'
car-buying decisions. And small cars remain the first purchase for
some young buyers who may form a lifelong attachment to the brand
of their first set of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   For such reasons, ``You don't ever want to get completely out of
a market,'' said Thomas Stallkamp, the president of DaimlerChrysler
AG's North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   To meet all these goals, Cynthia Hess, DaimlerChrysler's general
manager for small-car engineering, said here, automakers hope to
bring refinement and sophistication to the end of the market
previously known for just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone forever,'' she predicted, ``are the 13-inch wheels and
the gray plastic bumpers.''

`THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS': SALUTES TO BROADWAY, COSBY, WILLIE
NELSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of the review. Time, channel

   People thought nothing could top Joel Grey's portrayal of the
seedy, seductive master of ceremonies in ``Cabaret.'' Then they saw
Alan Cumming in the role (in this year's Roundabout Theater
revival). So until now, a lot of people thought nothing could top
Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night there is opportunity for direct comparison,
and synergy, when the two men sing and gyrate together to the
show's opening song, ``Wilkommen,'' on CBS. Then Bebe Neuwirth, who
played Velma Kelly in the current revival of ``Chicago,'' and Chita
Rivera, who created the role in the original Broadway production,
sing and dance a duet of that show's signature number, ``All That
Jazz.'' Then they all join Liza Minnelli (not in her best voice) in
a rendition of ``New York, New York.'' It's all to honor John
Kander and Fred Ebb, who wrote those songs, on ``The Kennedy Center
Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes skill to present a two-hour special that begins in a
decadent Berlin nightclub and ends with a stage full of small
children singing ``On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' or at least to do
it without some pretty jarring transitions, and the producers and
director have largely pulled it off. The experience is nothing like
seeing these performers live (Cumming's performance is much, much
nastier and more effective in the stage production), and the show
suffers from the limitations of all awards broadcasts, but the
latest ``Kennedy Center Honors'' presentation, taped on Dec. 6 in
Washington, is very good of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   The clips showing past performances by award recipients _ Kander
and Ebb, Bill Cosby, Willie Nelson, Andre Previn and Shirley Temple
Black _ are some of the best parts.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the show devoted to Cosby manages a nice
transition, from irreverence to touching tribute. Sinbad does a
stand-up comedy routine about Cosby's supposed shortcomings with
comments like: ``He used to eat up all his rations and ask you for
your food. That's the kind of guy he was.'' Sinbad says of ``A
Different World,'' a Cosby spinoff: ``I did it free for four years.
I never talked about this.'' As the segment ends with a tribute
from students in college on Cosby scholarships, the camera catches
President Clinton singing along with the students in ``That's What
Friends Are For.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones, Dwight Yoakam and Kris Kristofferson show up to
honor Nelson, who wrote country classics like ``Crazy'' and
``Hello, Walls'' before becoming a distinctive singing star
himself. Kristofferson pays tribute with ``On the Road Again,''
performed in front of Nelson's tour bus, brought onstage for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Farrow begins the tribute to her ex-husband Andre Previn
with an anecdote about his complete inability to make Jell-O. The
tribute covers his career as a composer of Oscar-winning Hollywood
movie scores, as a symphony conductor and, most recently, as the
creator of an opera based on Tennessee Williams' play ``A Streetcar
Named Desire.'' Renee Fleming's admirable performance of ``I Want
Magic,'' one of Blanche Dubois' numbers from the opera, goes a long
way toward explaining why the work hasn't received rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   If Shirley Temple Black ever received any bad reviews, nobody
remembers them now. Jack Lemmon begins the tribute, calling her ``a
child who will forever define the magic of the movie screen.'' She
later became a U.S. delegate to the United Nations and ambassador
to Ghana, but she will always be remembered for her movie career,
which began in the 1930s when she was 3. And before you know it, a
marching band is onstage and fifth graders from the U.N. School are
singing ``Let there be peace on earth.'' The show does indeed end
with dozens of would-be Shirley Temples, male and female,
tap-dancing, singing about a trip to the candy shop and taking
their bows in a shower of pink and white balloons. The people
behind this show really know how to create a sense of event.

 &HT;    UGA's Stinchcomb says goodbye to one great career, hello to
another
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Matt Stinchcomb's football career at the University of
Georgia will end sometime Thursday night, after the No. 19 Bulldogs
battle No. 12 Virginia in the Peach Bowl. When Stinchcomb walks off
the turf of the Georgia Dome, he'll leave with mixed emotions about
his four years in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some goals that weren't obtained,'' Stinchcomb
said. ``There were a lot of things that we could have done that we
didn't. I don't know if I'd call them regrets; probably
disappointments more than anything else. But there have been a lot
of surprises, as well. It's been a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals that weren't fulfilled were an SEC title and
playing with his younger brother, Georgia freshman Jon Stinchcomb,
who redshirted this season after injuring his knee as a senior at
Parkview High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to play with him,'' Stinchcomb said.
``But I think redshirting him was the best decision. I hope he's
better than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lofty goal for the younger Stinchcomb. Matt
Stinchcomb's four-year career went basically as scripted. He left
Atlanta-area Parkview High in 1995 on a path bound for NFL stardom.
Now, he leaves Georgia as a consensus All-American, the top
offensive lineman in the SEC and a probable first-round pick in
April's NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, a 6-foot-6, 291-pound native of Lilburn, Ga., also
wants to leave Athens on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to finish the season strong,'' he said. ``We
failed to do that in the regular season, so this bowl game presents
us another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, who graduated with a 3.96 grade-point average,
earned a finance degree from Georgia earlier this month, taking
only 3 1/2 years to finish his studies. Stinchcomb was a two-time
Academic All-American, and this year was named one of the NCAA's
top eight student-athletes in all sports. He was awarded an $18,000
post-graduate scholarship by the National Football Foundation,
which he might use for law school.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb will spend the next three months in Atlanta working
with personal trainers Chip Smith and Robby Stewart, who helped
former Bulldogs players Adam Meadows, Whit Marshall and Brandon
Tolbert improve their draft status.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NFL combine, Stinchcomb wants to improve his
upper-body strength _ he bench-presses 365 pounds _ and lower his
time in the 40-yard dash. Stinchcomb, perhaps the nation's most
fundamentally sound tackle, also is very durable; he missed the
first game of his career this season against Ole Miss with a
separated left shoulder. He is expected to be among the first
offensive tackles selected, along with UCLA's Kris Farris, a junior
who has not declared for the draft yet; Wisconsin's Aaron Gibson;
and Florida's Zach Piller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous player,'' said Georgia right tackle Chris
Terry, also expected to be an NFL draft choice. ``He's helped me
out a lot. At first, I was a little nervous about moving positions
(from defensive end to offensive tackle). I watched his technique
and noticed his work ethic. His hard work paid off for a lot of
players, especially me.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cavaliers, Stinchcomb faces another of the nation's
top pass-rushers in Virginia defensive end Patrick Kerney.
Stinchcomb faced Tennessee's Shaun Ellis, Florida's Jevon Kearse
and Georgia Tech's Jesse Tarplin earlier this season, yet the left
tackle graded 90 percent or better in blocking in all 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stinchcomb's had a great career,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan
said. ``Virginia's going to be a big challenge for him. I think our
ability to negate Kerney is going to be a key aspect of the game.''

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Except when he's running into the line or
filling out an informational questionnaire, Autry Denson is as
modest a college football hero as they come.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a side of Denson few see, revealed within a feature
item called the Denson File in the 448-page, seems-like-50-pound
Notre Dame football brochure.
</P>
<P>
   The question: If I were making a football ``Dream Team'' the
first three players I would pick would be . . . .
</P>
<P>
   His answer: Autry Denson, Barry Sanders and Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least, he didn't have to pick the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anyone give me any grief about that,'' Denson
said with a laugh after a practice for Thursday's Gator Bowl game
against Georgia Tech. ``I didn't think anybody read those things.''
Denson quietly has been making a name for himself the past three
years at Notre Dame. He comes into the game against Tech as the
Fighting Irish's all-time leading rusher with 4,318 yards after a
third 1,000-yard season in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the storied football program that has produced such
familiar names as Allen Pinkett, Vegas Ferguson and the Gipper,
George Gipp.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a prediction few paid attention to four years
ago. When former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz switched Denson from
cornerback to tailback after the first game of his freshman season,
Denson told reporters he wanted to become the greatest tailback in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could do it,'' he said. ``The only one I had to prove
anything to was myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the top 10 running backs on The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's Super Southern 100 in his senior year of
high school in Lauderhill, Fla., Denson has had to overcome the
cliche stigma about size relating to durability. He is 5-10, 200
pounds and his speed in the 40-yard dash ranges from 4.4 to 4.6
seconds, depending on who's holding the stopwatch.
</P>
<P>
   He says about his NFL future: ''I make no predictions, I just
hope somebody gives me the opportunity. I'd like to wait awhile
before using my degree in management information systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Davie has no reservations about Denson's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert on (the NFL),'' Davie said, ``but it's just
hard for me to imagine that a guy who has accomplished as much as
he has at Notre Dame would not be successful at the next level.
When you know him personally, and you're around his work ethic and
see how much pride he has, it's hard to imagine he wouldn't be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Denson's 1,176 yards in 1998 rank seven in Irish history. And
when he surpassed Pinkett for the all-time Notre Dame record with
two regular season games to play, it was Pinkett, now an investent
broker in Houston, on the telephone to offer congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me that it couldn't have happened to a better
person,'' Denson said. ``He just encouraged me to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But first there's the little business of dealing with Georgia
Tech on New Year's Day. He remembers the Yellow Jackets well. In
the 1997 season-opener, Denson was held to his second-lowest
rushing total that year, 71 yards, but he scored twice, including
the game-winner late in the fourth quarter, and the Irish prevailed
17-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that they played very hard, very aggressive,''
Denson said. ``Those linebackers they had last year were rough. I
think both of them are in the NFL now, too. They're rough. They
have some more good ones this year. They have a pretty good
corps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets might be keying on Denson this time around. With
quarterback Jarious Jackson coming off a knee injury, the Irish
could choose to limit his involvement in the option offense and
turn to Denson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any added pressure,'' Denson said. ``I just feel
I have to go out and play my game and the offensive unit has to go
out and play as a team. I don't feel there's any more burden put on
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Denson doesn't want to let his cheering section down. About
40 family members will be coming up from South Florida for the
game. ``Good thing I don't have to provide all the tickets.''
</P>

AUTO INSURANCE RATES GOING UP IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the first time in five years, the average
Massachusetts driver will be paying more for car insurance next
year, although the new rate provides just a small fraction of the
15.5 percent hike sought by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Linda L. Ruthardt Tuesday set a 1999 rate that
represents a 0.7 percent hike for policy holders or about an extra
$20 million in premium payments statewide.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer advocates say she should have lowered the rate
for next year, Ruthardt defended her decision, saying it would cost
a typical driver only ``about a dime a week.'' For the motorist
paying an average $835 premium, the increase would be $5.86.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt also noted that for those car owners who buy just the
mandatory coverage, the rate represents a 3.1 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ruthardt said she based the new rate on the evidence
the industry presented at hours of hearings, the state's auto
insurers denounced her decision and predicted large underwriting
losses for the firms from their auto policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very disturbing,'' said Dan Johnston, the president of
the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts. ``It clearly does
not provide even enough money in the system to keep the system
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said Ruthardt's decision will force insurers to pay out
about 6 percent more than they collect in auto premiums. He also
warned that it will likely spark an industry retreat from the
discount programs that have become available to Massachusetts
drivers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expects the companies to operate in a way that for every
$100 we collect we have to pay out $106,'' Johnston said. ``That's
an underwriting loss of six percent. I have never seen a number
like that anywhere in the country in a ratemaking process.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he would not make any further comment until he can
review the full text of the decision when it is released later this
week. In the past the industry has appealed rate decisions to the
state supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some consumer advocates claimed the industry must find
one aspect of the decision to its liking: it breaks four straight
years of rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privately (the industry has) to be pleased that a string of
decreases has been broken,'' said Stephen J. D'Amato, a consumer
insurance activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, it's hard to view this result as
anything but a loss for the consumers,'' said D'Amato, the former
head of the State Rating Bureau, which had recommended a 10 percent
decrease. The agency operates as a consumer advocate within the
insurance commission and makes recommendations to the commissioner
on filings by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a rare move by an insurance commissioner, Ruthardt
also leveled $9 million worth of sanctions against the industry,
money that has been factored into the rate.
</P>
<P>
   One fine, amounting to $3 million, was levied for the industry's
failure to provide information about the salaries that the
companies pay their executives. She said the industry had agreed
that the information it had turned over was inadequate. Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger, who had argued for a 12 percent rate
reduction, had called for a $100 million sanction on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Another, $6 million sanction was invoked because the industry
was unable to provide evidence that it had adhered to cost
containment programs that the commissioner had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a message being sent: you have have to comply with
discovery orders, and you have to comply with regulations that
require evidence of cost containment programs,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt rejected the insurers' request that she begin to
dismantle the system by which suburban drivers subsidize the rates
for urban drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office, Harshbarger said only
that he was ``disappointed'' in Ruthardt's decision not to cut the
rate, but applauded her for adopting a ``large number of my
recommendations on individual aspects of the rate case.''
</P>
<P>
   The departing attorney general, who had asked Ruthardt to recuse
herself from the case for having met with Johnston privately early
this year, said he would not make a decision whether to appeal the
decision until reading the commissioner's entire text.

TOULOUSE TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 3) 
(JT) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ Toulouse, the city of ancient pink-brick
churches and stately homes on the Garonne River in southwestern
France, may be noted for foie gras, but it is just as proud to be
the aerospace capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The first regularly scheduled airline flights in France took off
from the Toulouse airport in the 1920s, and now long-range
passenger planes of the Airbus consortium, Boeing's most important
rivals in world markets, are assembled in a vast hangar in the
suburb of Colomiers; the National Center for Space Research has
been centered in Toulouse for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor, Dominique Baudis, launched an air and space
museum, La Cite de l'Espace, which opened on the eastern outskirts
of the city in mid-1997, he hoped it would attract 160,000 people
in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a place where the general public could come to learn
what space exploration was all about, and how it's done,'' said
Jean-Noel Plachez, who worked with the mayor and conceived the
museum's exhibits, overseeing their design and construction in a
bit more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Space City succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. In its first
18 months, nearly half a million visitors have flocked to see it,
spending an average of five and a half hours a visit, lingering
over scores of interactive computer displays that let you find out
what it's like to program the launch of a satellite into orbit, how
satellites are maneuvered in space, and how they send the
information they gather back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical displays give a realistic sense of how difficult it
must be to close a valve on a space station in conditions of
weightlessness, or how easy to lose a satellite in space by putting
on a burst of speed at the wrong point during a launch.
</P>
<P>
   Life-size structural models abound, both inside _ where a huge
Soho solar observation satellite hangs in midair _ and in the
grounds outside, you can walk through part of the Mir orbital
station built by the Russians. The dials and controls look
curiously like something you might put together from a kit in your
basement, not high-tech at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Mir is replaced in space by the new international space
station whose first two stages have now been assembled, the museum
will develop exhibits on that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind the museum is that people will come out of
here a little more intelligent about space than when they came
in,'' said Bernard Burel, the general director.
</P>
<P>
   Space City may indeed make you feel smarter, though it is an
enormous help if you can read French. There are abridged
explanations of the static and interactive displays in English (and
other foreign languages including Catalan) that you can listen to
with headphones. Computer programming that will allow fuller
explanations over the headphones may take some time.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot you can figure out even without the language.
If you're a 55-year-old child like me, you may find illumination in
the simplest displays, such as the tilted globe moving in a circle
like the Earth's orbit around the sun, represented here by lamps
that show how the planet's inclination on its axis creates the
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   More complicated displays show, for example, how satellites
using radar measurements of the ocean's surface can determine wave
heights, and thus wind speeds, and how global positioning
satellites tell you precisely where you are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' said Sir Valentine Abdy, the European
representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who is intimately
familiar with its National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ``I
expected to see a pale imitation, and instead what I discovered was
something entirely new and original, dealing with the problems and
realities of space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Space City is a teaching tool, it's also terrific fun, as
Plachez showed while demonstrating, with the benefit of a clever
optical illusion, how easily he seemed able to leap half his own
height in the feeble gravitation of the earth's moon.
</P>
<P>
   The moon finally came to the museum on Dec. 10, 1998, when a
moon rock brought back on the Apollo 15 mission by the astronaut
David Scott was put on display until March 7, 1999. On loan from
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the rock is the
centerpiece of a series of temporary exhibits on the moon and the
American rockets and space vehicles that first put astronauts onto
its surface 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the space hardware on view is European, with the two
biggest pieces being the Russian Mir station, sold to the museum
indirectly by authorities of the cash-starved Russian space program
for $1 million, and a model of a towering Ariane 5 rocket developed
by the European Space Agency and its partners in France and
elsewhere to launch private satellites at $80 million a whack.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Space City officials, NASA gives most of its
obsolete hardware to the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to have more American objects on display,''
Burel said. ``The greatest space power in the world isn't well
represented here, and it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, John Glenn is here, holographically, in his
Mercury Friendship 1, as is Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1. And when John
Glenn went aloft again in the space shuttle Discovery in October,
the Space Museum showed the launching live on a giant screen.
</P>
<P>
   Originally planning a museum of sculpture on the site, in an
open plain near the city's first airport, Toulouse set its sights
on space instead in 1994, forming a semipublic company that raised
more than $27 million to finance the museum.
</P>
<P>
   About half the money came from funds provided by the city,
various French state ministries and agencies, and the Midi-Pyrenees
regional council. The rest came from other founding members or
associates including the European Space Agency, the National Space
Study Center, Aerospatiale (the French component of the Airbus
consortium), Matra Marconi Space, the national gas and electricity
utilities, and Meteo France, the national weather agency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with an operating budget of around $5.5 million a year, the
challenge, Plachez says, is keeping the exhibits up with the
fast-changing environment the museum represents. Overenthusiastic
schoolchildren also take a toll on sensitive toggles on the
interactive displays, and keep the small maintenance staff, in
black jeans and dark-blue windbreakers, on the run.
</P>
<P>
   The central part of the building, behind a striking metal screen
that resembles a deep space radio telescope, has three levels. You
start by passing a scale model showing various satellites orbiting
the earth, beginning with the space shuttle and going farther out
in space to geostationary communications satellites at 22,500
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive displays farther along explain how all those
satellites get up there, and what they're used for. One of the
first is a ``satellite table'' that challenges you to launch a
little red satellite and observe the shape of the orbit achieved by
applying or not applying speed at various points in the trajectory
with a booster _ one of 170 such interactive devices visitors come
across, this one teaching a bit of celestial mechanics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A little farther on, you choose your own rocket launcher and
satellite, program the launch on a computer, and then go inside a
realistic-looking control room to watch, on large monitoring
screens on the wall, blastoff and entry into orbit, all in real
time, though the images are of course films or computer
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   As you move along, holographs of actors playing key scientists
from Isaac Newton to Albert Einstein and Wernher von Braun can be
summoned up to tell you what their discoveries meant for space
exploration, and a little about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of von Braun, who used to do this sort of thing on
Walt Disney television shows before the Eisenhower administration
drafted him to help the United States catch up to the Russian
Sputnik with the launch of the first American Explorer satellite in
1958, initially caused some controversy. Some visitors thought the
museum let him off too easily for his work on the killer V-2
rockets built by the Nazis during World War II with the help of
forced labor at the rocket research center in Peenemunde.
</P>
<P>
   A model of Sputnik hangs over the stairs to the second floor,
which explores the uses of satellite observation of the earth, with
demonstrations of what satellites have discovered about vegetation,
tidal action, ozone levels and winds, and how they are used to
forecast the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the clearest explanation I have ever seen of how
photographic images in space are converted into digits for
transmission to earth and then reconverted into pictures, and I
understood for the first time how satellites using radar can scan
the ocean's surface and produce an approximate picture of the sea
bottom _ the surface is full of bumps and dips that roughly mirror
the ones thousands of feet below, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The top floor focuses on exploration of the universe. Here are
fascinating close-ups from fly-bys of the moons of Jupiter, and
explanations of how the Hubble Telescope has changed notions of the
age and size of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to earth, on the ground floor again, the Planetarium
(reserve a seat for a showing when you buy your tickets) takes you
on a quick virtual tour of the solar system and the galaxy, using
an American Digistar 2 three-dimensional projector with some seats
that recline almost horizontally for a better view. A simulated
collision with an asteroid acts as an alarm clock for those who
need one.
</P>
<P>
   The small museum shop is full of toys, models, souvenir meteor
fragments, books and even ``space wine'' from the Domaine de
Ribonnot nearby, a red that costs about $10 a bottle, but leaves
you guessing about whether French astronauts needed any to put
themselves in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   Air France flies to Toulouse from the Orly Ouest terminal in
Paris, and its competitor Air Liberte flies from Orly Sud. Round
trips paid for two weeks in advance start at $130 (at 5.5 francs to
the dollar) for adults on Air Liberte, $151 on Air France; there
are also discounts for travelers under 25.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed trains from Paris Montparnasse cost $157 round trip;
there are discounts for a two-week advance purchase, for families
and for travelers in certain age groups. The trip takes five hours
each way.
</P>
<P>

BLEDSOE TO GET LATEST WORD ON FINGER WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Jacksonville Jaguars have one less day
to prepare for Sunday's wild-card playoff game against the
Patriots, because they played Monday night, posting a 21-3 win over
the once-proud Pittsburgh Steelers in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good part for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part is that Jacksonville will be playing at home,
quarterback Mark Brunell is ready to go (though not at 100 percent,
after an ankle injury), and the Jaguars will have the momentum of a
win.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Patriots are coming off a crushing loss to the
Jets and don't know definitively who their starting quarterback
will be, though the distinct possibility is that it won't be Drew
Bledsoe, who is scheduled to get a medical evaluation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If it is thumbs-down on Bledsoe, who is still treating a
fractured finger, the Patriots will go into the playoffs with
backup Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't throw, he can't throw,'' said defensive end Willie
McGinest. ``Nothing is going to make him use his fingers better.
He'll do everything he can, but if he can't, then we'll have to get
behind people who are in there like Scott Zolak. He's a veteran guy
who's been around here for a long time. This would be a great thing
for Scott to be able to play and lead us to a win. The guys here
have faith in Scott. You can't blame him for Sunday; everybody had
a hand in that.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being considered is to remove the pin from
Bledsoe's finger and have him try to play with a splint, as he did
before.
</P>
<P>
   The healing process is only about halfway complete, and doctors
must determine whether Bledsoe could do long-term damage if he
plays and is reinjured.
</P>
<P>
   There is pressure on Bledsoe, as the franchise player, to give
it a go, and from a team point of view, the Patriots can't think
about anything beyond the Jacksonville game _ not even a possible
matchup in Denver against the Broncos in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Zolak wasn't horrible news two weeks ago, when he led
New England to a victory over the 49ers. But it wasn't the best of
scenarios last weekend in New Jersey, when the Patriots were
outplayed in every aspect of the game in a 31-10 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' locker room is certainly mixed on whether Bledsoe
should play. Some feel he has to play if it's physically possible,
while others don't want him in there if he's not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't be effective with the finger as is, then there's
no point,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy. ``Drew has to know that if
he plays, he'll be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, players and fans remember the 26-20 win in
Jacksonville last season as the team's finest moment. The Patriots
played without Curtis Martin and Terry Glenn, and Bledsoe seized
the moment. In what many considered his best game of the season, he
completed 26 of 35 for 234 yards, with two touchdowns and no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a game in which Bledsoe showed some spunk and
leadership, jawing with receiver Vincent Brisby for not getting
himself open while Bledsoe was running for his life. Bledsoe took
the argument to the sidelines, and Brisby responded with four
receptions for 58 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Patriots are coming off a disastrous loss and may
not have Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   How do they overcome that?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same way we overcame the St. Louis loss,'' said receiver
Shawn Jefferson. ``We just find a way. We've already forgotten
about New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you play for,'' said Milloy. ``We don't dwell on
losing games. We take the next challenge on. If we played badly, we
improve the next week. That has to be our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Jets game, McGinest said, ``What game?''
</P>
<P>
   With Brunell not as mobile as he can be, it may be a game that
comes down to how well McGinest can get after him. Coming off a leg
injury, McGinest slowly made his way back into the lineup against
the Jets and expects to go all out in this one. He'll likely have
to battle the Jaguars' Tony Boselli, widely considered the best
offensive lineman in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how (Brunell's) ankle is,'' said McGinest.
``Hank (Henry Thomas) had a similar injury, and when he came back,
he wasn't moving around as well. So he may not be trying to run
around as much. They might try and design plays to sit in the
pocket and throw the ball and get away from the boots or the naked
(bootlegs) that he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know. We have to prepare for the Brunell that we
know, who runs the draw, the nakeds, and who is going to be
scrambling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell can be a pocket passer, and he has excellent wideouts in
Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell to throw to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reads defenses so well,'' said McGinest. ``We looked at old
games we've had against them in the past because we haven't seen
them this year. They have the same team they've always had except
that they've got (running back) Fred Taylor, who did a great job
for them. We have to figure out what Taylor does good or bad and
try to find a way to contain him. They have their receivers playing
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 3-0 against Jacksonville the last three years,
with the 1996 AFC Championship game the most decisive win (20-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that we've played them in the past and that we've
played Brunell before,'' said defensive end Chris Sullivan, who is
scheduled to return to the lineup after missing a game with a sore
knee.

   CAMBODIA-DEFECTORS (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ A top leader of the
Khmer Rouge mutters an apology, saying he is ``sorry, very sorry''
for the suffering he caused the Cambodian people. But the leader,
Khieu Samphan, repeatedly urges Cambodians and foreigners to ``let
bygones be bygones'' regarding the deaths of more than a million
people between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia
and he was head of state. By Seth Mydans. (MOVED)

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ Since President Clinton was impeached by
the House 10 days ago, the airwaves have filled with senatorial
speculation about a speedy trial and perhaps even a pre-emptive

not agree on just how a trial should be conducted, or what a
workable censure deal would be. By James Bennet.

   EURO (Strasbourg, France) _ The launch of a new currency, the
euro, on Friday represents the single most important change on the
Continent since the end of the Cold War. In getting to this point,
11 European nations have for the first time adopted a common
economic policy that has reined in public spending, reduced debt
and tamed inflation. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   BLACKS-SOUTH _ In last month's election, Rep. Sanford D. Bishop
Jr., a moderate black Democrat, won re-election convincingly in a
rural, conservative district where nearly two-thirds of the voters
are white. Many black politicians have managed to attract white
support in urban, New South areas like Atlanta. But Bishop's
electoral success demonstrates that even in the most rural and
impoverished districts, a significant number of white Southerners
no longer view race as an absolute obstacle to voting for a black
politician who shares their thinking, votes their interests and
hauls home plenty of pork. By Kevin Sack. 2,400 words.

   MURDOCH-BAYLEY (Oxford, England) _ Iris Murdoch, the celebrated
author of 26 rigorously intellectual novels, stood uncertainly in
the doorway of her living room, her face frozen in the blank
expression that is a sure badge of Alzheimer's disease. It was only
when she saw her husband, the critic, professor and novelist John
Bayley, that a flicker of comprehension sparked in her eyes. But it
was gone, as quickly as it came. Bayley talks about his 40 years
with Murdoch, and his new memoir, ``Elegy for Iris,'' due out in
January. By Sarah Lyall. (MOVED)

   STRASBOURG, France _ This border city in Alsace-Lorraine has
been French and then German and then French again, depending on who
won the last war. But today it is a placid outpost in more unified
Europe: a home for the European Parliament, and a mecca for
cross-border shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Europe's single currency, the euro,
arrived well before its official introduction this Friday. At the
Cora supermarket just outside of town, everything from bananas to
televisions have been priced in euros (as well as French francs)
for months. At upscale restaurants like the Roma, euro-pricing on
menus is a fashion must.
</P>
<P>
   And residents like Michel Raymond, who shops for Grand Marnier
in France but port wine Germany, are opening euro checking accounts
right after the New Year. ``It will make things simpler for
everybody,'' said Raymond, a retired French businessman. ``Some
things are cheaper here and others are cheaper on the German side.
This will make the payments easier.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of dreams, diplomacy and delays the euro is
suddenly real. On Thursday, 11 European countries are to lock their
exchange rates to the euro, now worth about $1.17, and cede to the
new European Central Bank the power to set interest rates and
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the street it may look as if little has happened. But
currency conversion represents the most important step in Europe's
long quest for political unity. In getting to this point, the 11
euro nations for the first time have adopted a common economic
policy that has reined in public spending, reduced debt and tamed
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This achievement has altered the political debate dramatically;
indeed governments in Germany, France and Italy have fallen in
large part because of the spending cutbacks required to create the
euro. Business strategy has been transformed, and more and more
residents and visitors are thinking of Europe as a single place
instead of a jigsaw of nationalities and a hodge-podge of
currencies and laws.
</P>
<P>
   Today's German marks, French francs, Italian lire and eight
other currencies may be used for three and a half years more. (Euro
notes and coins arrive on January 2002.) But beginning Monday, the
value of each currency will be based only on the value of the euro.
Local currencies are to be removed from circulation by July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, European stock and bond trades will be
denominated entirely in euros. All transactions between banks,
which is frequently how Europeans pay their bills, will be in
euros, even within the same country. Bank customers can write
checks in euros, and many credit-card purchases will be calculated
in euros. Euro traveler's checks are making their debut.
</P>
<P>
   Though Americans are largely bystanders, the euro will affect
them, too. Travelers will be spared the necessity of changing
dollars into several different currencies, and currency headaches
and risks will be reduced for money managers handling multinational
accounts. That alone is expected to yield substantial savings.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro was once viewed as a currency weakling because of
doubts that Spain and Italy would have the discipline to get into
fiscal trim, all signs now suggest the euro will start off strong
and may come to rival the dollar as a reserve currency held by
central banks around the world. If that happens, economists say, it
could push up U.S. interest rates slightly. It could also make
European goods more expensive for Americans to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency may also be a means for Europe to grow into a
stronger competitor with the United States: The move to a unified
market and a single currency has forced the transformation of
Europe's biggest industries. Many are merging with rivals to cut
costs; others selling off businesses to refocus on their strengths.
And quite a few, like DaimlerChrysler AG, have been doing both.
</P>
<P>
   One major European country that is not party to the euro is
Britain, which has always viewed itself as separate. It is taking a
wait-and-see attitude because of public fears that using the euro
would erode Britain's independence.
</P>
<P>
   British businesses definitely favor the currency, however, and
worry that they will suffer a disadvantage by holding on to the
pound. But Prime Minister Tony Blair insists Britain will consider
using the euro after the next round of national elections, which
are likely by 2002, and only after a national referendum.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Why did the 11 other nations go to all the trouble?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a single currency dates back to the 1950s, when
postwar leaders like Jean Monnet, a diplomat and president of a
precursor to the European Union, sketched out sweeping visions for
economic and political unification aimed at avoiding another war.
The idea was that the more each nation relied on the others for
economic and political security, the more reluctant they would be
to send their armies into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But the real impetus came with the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989. The prospect of a reunited German powerhouse alarmed many
Western European governments, French President Francois Mitterand
pressured German Chancellor Helmut Kohl: France would support
German reunification if Kohl would commit his government to
replacing the German mark with a plan for a single currency and
administered by an independent European central bank.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``After reunification, a lot of the neighbors around Germany
were afraid that it might become politically and economically too
strong,'' said Peter Wolf-Koeppen, who oversees euro projects at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ``They first tried to make a political
union, but they failed. A monetary union was the best they could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl quickly became the euro's strongest champion, driven in
part by his desire for a place in history and in part by his own
memories during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have often been told that the euro was a technocratic idea,
invented by finance ministers,'' remarked Christian Noyer, vice
president of the European Central Bank. ``That is clearly not the
case. They had the simple idea that the money, the currency that
people use every day, was a way to foster European integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in the Dutch city
of Maastricht, European leaders reached a basic agreement, with a
strongly German imprint. Countries would have to meet strict limits
on budget deficits and would have to bring inflation rates down to
Germany's levels, or about 3 percent. But the Bundesbank, the
influential German central bank, would take a back seat to a new
and independent European Central Bank, which would focus almost
exclusively on fighting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's proponents argue that it will make Europe more
efficient and competitive because pricing differences will stand
out. Trade will be enhanced because foreign-exchange risks will be
minimal. (Europe abolished most tariffs and other trade
restrictions six years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But more important, supporters predict that the greater
attention to prices will force cost-cutting by manufacturers. And
while that may contribute to Europe's high unemployment, it may
also trigger much-needed changes in costly regulations that hinder
competitiveness today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can work like a reform program for Europe, and be very
good for the competitiveness of Europe,'' said Juergen Stark, vice
president of the Bundesbank. ``On the one hand it is a great
political challenge. But on the other it is a great opportunity for
Europe to combine sound monetary and fiscal policy with more
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the euro will seem at first like a phantom
currency because notes and coins are not slated to enter
circulation until Jan. 1, 2002, to give Europeans a chance to get
used to the new currency and merchants time to adjust. And while
euros will be usable beginning Monday in the ether of electronic
payments, nobody can be forced to accept them before 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten lots of mail about the euro from my bank, but I
have not read much of it,'' said Karine Rousselle, a school teacher
in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
   Many bankers argue that the long transition period simply makes
the process needlessly costly and complicated. Instead of just
converting to a new currency, banks have to change first to a
system of dual currencies, which will become obsolete in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, estimates that it will
spend more than $200 million on the conversion over the next four
years. ``The dual currency makes it much more expensive than it
would have been otherwise,'' said Peter Wolf-Koeppen, at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   But European merchants are reaching very different conclusions
about how fast to offer goods priced in euros.
</P>
<P>
   In France, big supermarkets like Le Clerc and Caro are already
posting all prices in euros and plan to accept euros for
credit-card payments soon after the new year begins. In Germany,
where many people are still hostile to trading in their solid marks
for untested euros, big retailers are moving more slowly; most plan
to post dual prices on some items right away, mainly to educate
customers, but they are reluctant to make a full conversion in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, managers at the Cora hypermarket simply steer
attention away from the euro price. A big sign promoting a
widescreen television announces a price in francs: FF 7,990.00. The
euro price _ e 1,206.97 _ is only printed in small letters on the
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of marketing uncertainties, some
consumer-product companies are delaying the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keeping the national currencies as long as possible,
because God knows what is going to happen,'' said Peter Csandi, a
spokesman for Adidas, the big sportswear company. ``We're going to
let someone else find out the answers on how to teach consumers
about the euro. We don't intend to be pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Europe's biggest industrial companies
are converting rapidly, convinced that they can quickly recoup the
cost by saving money on foreign-exchange dealings. DaimlerChrysler
and Siemens plan both plan to convert all their business systems
early in 1999. They are also pressing suppliers to bill in euros,
which is likely to speed up acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has confounded naysayers ever since European leaders
laid down the timetable in the early 1990s. As recently as four
years ago, many market analysts were convinced that few countries
would overcome national pride to abandon their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   When it became increasingly clear that monetary union would
indeed occur, most people assumed it would be limited to about
eight ``core'' countries, led by Germany and France. But Europe's
poorer and shakier countries _ Italy, Spain and Portugal _ started
clamoring to join the club. And to the amazement of many, they
brought their budget deficits and inflation rates down enough to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be some nasty surprises. European economic
growth is uneven. There are inflation risks in some fast-growing
countries like Spain and Ireland; at the same time growth is
slowing in countries like Germany and France, where unemployment
rates remain above 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the new central bank is set uniform interest
rates that will foster growth everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape has also changed dramatically. Some
leading politicians who pushed for the euro are out of power now,
casualties of voter objections to relentless budget cutting,
especially on social programs. New governments in Germany, Italy
and France are not so beholden to the rules set out to create the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   After Kohl and his center-right coalition were defeated last
September by Gerhard Schroeder and the left-of-center Social
Democratic Party, Germany's new finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine,
quickly became a vocal critic of both the Bundesbank and the
European Central Bank. He argued that tight-money policies brought
about by the euro were the real reason that European unemployment
mostly remains high.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Maastricht Treaty, political leaders have no authority
over the European Central Bank, which is led by a former Dutch
central banker, Wim Duisenberg. And a separate treaty theoretically
calls for huge fines on governments whose spending generates
deficits of more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. The
rules also say that once a nation enters the euro union, it cannot
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, many experts are skeptical that European leaders
would ever impose such punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries have to realize that the misbehaviors of one country
can damage all the others,'' said Stark, the Bundesbank official.
``If a big country runs a high deficit, it is pretty clear the
European Central Bank will have to react with a rate increase.''

 &HT;    Bulldogs' Bailey likely to enter NFL Draft
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia All-America cornerback Champ Bailey, a
6-foot-1, 180-pound junior, probably will be playing his final game
for the Bulldogs on Thursday, coach Jim Donnan said Tuesday. Bailey
is expected to enter April's NFL Draft and could be a top-five
pick, according to some NFL sources. Bailey has until Jan. 8 to
declare for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a meeting with Champ and his mother after the bowl
game, but I would think pretty much that this is going to be his
last game,'' Donnan said. The No. 19 Bulldogs face No. 12 Virginia
in the Peach Bowl in the Georgia Dome on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the speculation all season after Bailey emerged as
the nation's top two-way threat, averaging 87 plays per game at
cornerback and wideout and on special teams. Bailey, who won the
Bronko Nagurski Award as the nation's top defensive player, had 52
tackles, three interceptions and 10 pass breakups as a senior. He
also was Georgia's top wideout, finishing with 47 catches for 744
yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (NFL scouts) like him better on offense and as a
kick-returner,'' Donnan said. ``I would say more than likely that
he'll play corner at the next level. Guys like him are like
dinosaurs. You can't find guys that can cover like him. Look at all
the people he's covered over the last two years, and he's blanketed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has repeatedly said he'll wait until after the Peach Bowl
to make a decision. His mother, Elaine Bailey, is adamant about him
earning his degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the game, I'm just going to start thinking about
it,'' Bailey said. ``Right now, we're just focusing on Virginia. I
know what's important to me. I've been able to keep (the NFL)
pushed back pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a banner year for the Bulldogs in the NFL draft.
Along with Bailey, offensive tackles Matt Stinchcomb and Chris
Terry are expected to be high draft choices.

 &HT;    Kerney is UVA's pleasant surprise
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As football odysseys go, Patrick Kerney's is as
improbable as, what, the Falcons winning the NFC West? Actually,
the Dirty Birds were a September sure thing compared to a kid who:
</P>
<P>
   Left his Pennsylvania home to play hockey at a toney Connecticut
prep school. Took up lacrosse and also played football for the Taft
School. Played final game against arch-rival Hotchkiss, before a
crowd of 50 (''And those were probably parents''). Got one football
recruiting call, from a Syracuse coach who'd dialed the wrong
number. Went to Virginia on a lacrosse scholarship and walked on
for the football team. Hoped to be a second-string defensive end by
now. Inadvertently became an All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that summer day in 1995 when he walked on in
Charlottesville, Kerney said, ''I think they were expecting some
little preppy kid they could break down in a few days and send home
crying to mama.''
</P>
<P>
   What Virginia got instead was a nonpareil pass rusher who led
the ACC in sacks (15) and tackles for lost yardage (21), became an
All-American (first-team Football Writers Assn. of America,
second-team AP) and was so hounded by agents this fall he had to
get an unlisted phone number.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls may resume, and multiply, after Kerney concludes
his collegiate career Thursday night against Georgia in the Peach
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   How did all this happen? ''Our lacrosse staff did a heckuva job
recruiting him,'' said UVa defensive coordinator Rick Lantz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Patrick making All-American is a great tribute to him.
Not to us,'' said Cavaliers head coach George Welsh. ''When you
come in as a walk-on, he had alot to do with it himself, working in
the weight room and on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney's explanation? ''Patience and perseverance, my two
favorite words,'' he said. ''I did what I was told, worked hard and
I didn't expect success overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kerney became an over-four-years(cq) sensation. Even
he's astounded, even now. ''When I look back to when I first
arrived at Virginia, this is a whole 'nother(cq) world,'' he said.
''It's certainly exceeded my expectations. It's wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet all true. All-ACC and second in the voting for ACC Defensive
Player of the Year, Kerney was all over opposing quarterbacks. He
had three sacks against both Maryland and Florida State (one ending
Chris Weinke's season). He tied UVa records for sacks and TFL's in
a season. He was one of five finalists for the Bronko Nagurski
Award that Georgia's Champ Bailey won as the nation's best
defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve in the Georgia Dome, Kerney will confront Matt
Stinchcomb, Georgia's All-American offensive left tackle from
Lilburn who hasn't allowed a sack all season. ''He's an excellent
football player,'' Stinchcomb said. ''Plays whistle to whistle.
More than anything, he finishes off the play, better than most
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney's football career seemed finished after high school, when
he chose to play lacrosse at UVa. ''I was going to give up
football,'' said Kerney. While he was curious to see whether he
could play Division I-A football, ''I had my doubts. My goal was to
be a backup defensive end and see some action by this year.''
</P>
<P>
   What Welsh and his staff immediately saw was a relentless, swift
6-foot-5 kid. ''He showed us something,'' said Lantz. ''Showed us
he was capable of playing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney not only made the team, he became one of five true
freshmen to play in 1995. Still a sub - but on scholarship - in
'96, he became a starter last season, a star this fall. He's now
6-foot-6, 260 pounds and a likely high NFL draft choice. All this
from a guy who once terrorized Hotchkiss and the rest of the
Founder's League. Go figure.

SLUGGING IT OUT FOR 1998'S WORST, FROM SPRINGER TO `PFEIFFER' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now the hard part _ the worst of TV in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So much effluvia and so little space.
</P>
<P>
   I know this: If digital TV were a program rather than a
technology, it would be on the worst-10 list. Digital
high-definition TV will one day be the standard. Today it's the
Yawn of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   And what a year for connoisseurs of the truly despicable. Think
about it. UPN trots out a series that's ``ER'' in outer space, and
as bad as it was _ too boring to be redeemably weird _ it still
wasn't bad enough for our list.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up, 1998; turn around and drop your trousers. You really
were special.
</P>
<P>
   Here goes, no particular order, but that all-too-familiar odor,
the year's 10 worst:
</P>
<P>
   _ MSNBC coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Only the
certifiably demented could possibly stomach MSNBC's virtually
nonstop cacophony of presidential and congressional shame.
</P>
<P>
   The daily diet of nitwits, apologists, creeps and cranks was so
noxious that it helped drive Keith Olbermann out of news and back
to sports, at Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism was a bit player. The national interest was even less
of a concern as NBC News and its partner, Microsoft, hammered and
yammered.
</P>
<P>
   _ CBS coverage of the Winter Olympics from Nagano, Japan. Bad
luck, bad weather, bad decisions. Believe in harbingers? CBS
launched its coverage by interrupting the ``Ode to Joy,'' in the
climactic movement in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, the commentary. CBS hired Jim Rippey as its snowboarding
analyst. Rippey's snowboarding analysis went something like this:
``Yeah, Chris! C'mon, buddy!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it didn't go something like that. It went exactly like
that.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerry Springer. For his TV show. For his movie. For his very
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there some vague neural impulse reminding me of a promise
somewhere, from someone, to tone down the mayhem on the TV program?
</P>
<P>
   Seems the word didn't reach Jerry. The show is a bellicose blend
of bleeped language and halfhearted brawls featuring America's
beefiest bozos.
</P>
<P>
   The act will get old. It has to get old. Then, maybe, Springer
will scoop up his money and go away.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.'' It was pronounced
``Puh-feiffer,'' and it was puh-foundly bad however you said or saw
it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, a sitcom about the wacky White House of the Lincoln
administration, with Abe delving into cybersex via telegraph while
Mary Todd pined for her boy toys.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, health officials announced that hallucinogenic
drugs had successfully been removed from the water supply at UPN
television. The network then canceled ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Last Don II.'' Sex! Murder! Cannelloni! The further
low-rent adventures of the trumped-up mob boss Cross De Lena.
</P>
<P>
   When last glimpsed, he was enjoying a light moment of family
intimacy with one of his mobster cousins. This after he'd just
ordered a few dozen people whacked, including an innocent priest
whose throat was slit.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Magic Hour.'' Magic is one element that was
conspicuously missing from this quickly canceled syndicated talk
show hosted by Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Someone figured that Johnson's pleasing personality and megawatt
smile translated into talk-show skills. Wrong calculation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the year's worst moments, a kind of Super Bowl of TV
superficiality, came when fellow talk-show rookie Howie Mandel paid
a visit to Johnson's show to proclaim, ``You know what, I love
me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An All-Star Party for Aaron Spelling.'' Had it been ``An
All-Star Lynching Party for Aaron Spelling,'' I'd have joined the
applause.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the ABC special _ buried on a Saturday night in March
_ was a crass exercise in butt-bussing for the monstrously prolific
and richer-than-Croesus producer of ``Charlie's Angels,''
``Dynasty,'' ``Melrose Place,'' ``Models Inc.'' and ``The Love
Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The show included a special segment on all-girl cat fights, an
awkward reunion of the original ``Charlie's Angels'' and a gospel
choir singing the ``Love Boat'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Brave New World.'' At least with ``Crime and Punishment''
NBC tried to do justice to a literary classic. This NBC movie was
punchless and visually washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Leonard Nimoy as Mustapha Mond, the benevolent
dictator of Aldous Huxley's futuristic tale. Nimoy's wardrobe was a
skirt accessorized by a necklace of big orange beads. Spock,
perchance, has blown his sprocket.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Damon.'' Damon Wayans' Fox sitcom was every bit as
spectacularly tasteless as last year's champ, ``South Park.'' And
it wasn't funny.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans played a police detective who, in the din of the
premiere's raucous laugh track, pretended to hump one colleague and
mounted a robust defense of breast ogling at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said, ``women always gonna have breasts, and men
are always, like, gonna look at them. And if God didn't want it
that way, he wouldn't have put them right up front in the middle
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   I presume that God wanted ``Damon'' canceled forthwith, or he
wouldn't have put it right up front on the Fox schedule like that.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Kelly Kelly.'' Don't remember this one, do you? Shelley
Long, making her big comeback, on the WB, as English professor
Kelly Novak, who marries a firefighter named Doug Kelly. Making
her, uh, Kelly Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   And that's as funny as it got. Unless you wanted to think about
it from a distance, and realize that she was really Shelley Kelly
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember Long fondly for ``Cheers.'' Her next network
project, perhaps prophetically, is an NBC movie called ``Vanished:
Without a Trace.''

 &HT;    Edsall effect raised Tech on defense
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Randy Edsall's stay at Georgia Tech turned
out much shorter than even he anticipated. This week is his
farewell tour after a year as Tech's defensive coordinator and 17
years as an assistant coach at Syracuse, Boston College and the
Jacksonville Jaguars. After Friday's Gator Bowl, Edsall leaves to
become Connecticut's coach.
</P>
<P>
   But as he and Tech defenders look back over the season, they
realize that they accomplished a good bit in a short time and that
Edsall might have made the kind of impact that will last for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't always pretty,'' Edsall said. ``But I don't think
there was ever a time where we never played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's improvement did not show in the numbers: The Yellow
Jackets went from last in the ACC in total defense in 1997 (429
yards allowed per game) to eighth (397.6). Tech held steady at
seventh in the conference in both rushing defense and
passing-efficiency defense, same as in 1997. And scoring defense
went up from 24.2 points allowed in 1997 to 24.3 points allowed in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is in the nine wins, not the defensive numbers.
Tech's defense cost the Yellow Jackets wins in 1997, late in games
against Notre Dame, Virginia and Georgia; but in 1998, it was
bringing them home, against Virginia, Georgia and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted we didn't play well against (Boston College), but
there was not one game where the defense let the team down and let
somebody else win,'' Edsall said. ``The Virginia game, yeah they
had some yards, but we made all the plays we had to make in the
second half, and we were stingy. Same thing in the Georgia game.
Right there early in the game, we give up that big play, but we
came back and played pretty darn well the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsall said the goals he set for the Yellow Jackets on defense
coming into the season were to play a championship season, keep
people from scoring, be a good third-down team and create
turnovers. Tech came away with a share of the ACC championship, an
NCAA record with seven fumbles returned for touchdowns and an
improvement in third-down-efficiency defense, from allowing teams
to convert 44.4 percent of the time in 1997 to 36.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the '97 season, Tech's defense was tight, feeling
the pressure of losing games late. Playing on defense didn't look
like much fun anymore. That's what Edsall set out to restore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to let them go,'' Edsall said. ``We tried to let them
have fun within the scheme of a defense. We didn't want to harness
them. We didn't want to put a noose on them and make them feel
restricted. We wanted to be aggressive, because I think kids enjoy
that. We knew there would be mistakes, and we coached off the
mistakes. They liked that opportunity that we gave them, having
that ability to do those things, and I think it paid off for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he won his players' respect and loyalty, which
makes this last week all the more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's going to replace him, but I'm just glad I'm
not going to be here,'' senior defensive end Nate Stimson said. ``I
don't want to play for anyone else. Everyone is happy for him, but
a lot of people don't want him to go because we like him. His goal
is to be a head coach, and he got it, so he's got to go for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The impression Edsall hopes he leaves behind is this one: ``When
people look back on the 1998 Georgia Tech defense,'' Edsall said,
``(it) was one that played hard, never gave up, was opportunistic
and they made plays when they had to.''

 &HT;    Diet drink ads turn to 'feel good'
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first new commercials for Diet Coke in nearly a
year will appear Monday, just in time to capture that perennial
army of New Year's resolution-bound dieters.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than focusing on how the world's No. 1 diet soft
drink can help consumers cut a more dashing figure, the ads suggest
Diet Coke can empower them to be their best while living life to
the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Your Life'' is the tagline, a departure from the previous
``You Are What You Drink'' and the long-running ``Just For the
Taste of It'' campaigns. The new phrase, featured in the two new
commercials and likely to be used in another half-dozen expected
later this year, was crafted after Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
interviewed 3,600 Diet Coke loyalists in nine countries about what
role the beverage plays in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The research showed that ``looking good is important, but it's a
subcomponent of feeling good,'' said Jan Hall, Diet Coke's global
brand director.
</P>
<P>
   One of the commercials, from the Portland, Ore.-based Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy agency, shows a woman preparing to use a video dating
service. As she sips a Diet Coke, she reflects on her options and
realizes she is happy with her life the way it is. The other
features a woman who lets a cute guy's car roll off a cliff so she
can offer him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This advertising is reflective and consistent with living life
on your own terms,'' said Ian Rowden, Coca-Cola's global
advertising director. ``It's less focused on some of the shape and
calorie benefits of the brand and more on how consumers see their
life and how they react to the changes in their life.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials follow what Coca-Cola said is the best year for
its flagship diet drink since 1990. Incomplete figures show U.S.
volume rising 4 percent over 1997 and worldwide sales up about 8
percent, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The diet beverage category has been sagging for years, but
Coca-Cola and its competitors hope to change that with a slate of
new marketing campaigns set for release in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Pepsico and No. 3 Cadbury Schweppes also will release new
advertising for their diet drinks, as well as for their
full-calorie brands.
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, publisher of trade publication Beverage Digest,
said he's not surprised by the flurry of new campaigns _
particularly for diet soft drinks. That's because the Food and Drug
Administration recently approved two new beverage sweeteners, which
taste more like sugar, and make for a longer shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   All the beverage companies are still weighing how to take
advantage of the new sweetener options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diet segment is going to be fascinating to watch for the
next few years,'' said Sicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be more focus and attention on the diet
sector. More focus means more growth, or more potential for
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diet drinks peaked in 1990, making up 29.8 percent of the U.S.
soft drink market, according to Beverage Digest. In 1997, the last
year for which figures are available, diet drinks made up just 22.9
percent of the total soft drink market. Within that diet market,
products from Coca-Cola had a 49.5 percent share compared to 32.2
percent for Pepsico's brands and 7.7 percent for Cadbury Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico has been trying to shift the weight with its Pepsi One
brand, which has been called the first innovation in the U.S. diet
soft drink arena in more than 16 years. The one-calorie drink,
introduced in October, is the first to use a blend of aspartame and
acesulfame potassium, also known as Ace-K, one of the newly
approved sweetener options.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing blitz for Pepsi One has been under way since
October, with commercials starring actor Cuba Gooding of ``show me
the money'' fame, and it's not expected to let up anytime soon. The
company wouldn't release details about the next wave of
commercials, but it plans to spend $100 million promoting Pepsi One
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico is among the advertisers spending an average $1.6
million per 30-second spot during the Super Bowl Jan. 31. The
company has not said which brands it plans to feature during its
air time.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, however, expect some of the Super Bowl ads to
introduce a new Pepsi theme, ending the year-old ``Generation
Next'' campaign that hasn't been a hit with beverage chief Phil
Marineau.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which ran just one Super Bowl commercial last year
compared to several by Pepsico, isn't shelling out the cash to
advertise during the upcoming game.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes, however, is using the event to unveil a new 7
UP campaign, which will be teased to in TV commercials during the
two weeks before the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The spots will lay the groundwork for the campaign, which asks
``Are U an UN?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a play on the brand's Un-Cola trademark and a chance to
distinguish the beverage from conventional soft drinks, said Mike
McGrath, president and chief operating officer of Plano,
Texas-based Dr Pepper/Seven Up, part of London-based Cadbury
Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. division, which said it plans to spend 12 percent more
to promote its Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper brands this year, was
not included in the $1.85 billion deal Coca-Cola recently announced
to buy most of Cadbury Schweppes' global beverage operations.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve new TV spots for Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper begin
airing in primetime Jan. 11. The bulk of the commercials are for
Diet Dr Pepper, and revolve around the idea that some people can't
tell the difference between that drink and ``regular'' Dr Pepper.

MOTHER OF OCTUPLETS TO BE RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional trim included) 
 
By CAROL CHRISTIAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nkem Chukwu, who gave birth to octuplets this month,
is scheduled to be released from the hospital Tuesday, while her
seven surviving babies have passed an important medical test and
are now given a 92 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, 29, is still anemic but slowly gaining strength, said
Dr. Brian Kirshon, her attending physician and maternal-fetal
medicine specialist and high-risk obstetrician at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very weak from being bedridden for such a long time,''
said Kirshon, who delivered the world's first octuplets born alive.
The first baby was born naturally Dec. 8 and the other seven by
Caesarean section Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu entered St. Luke's in early October and had been confined
to bed for six weeks before the first delivery.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 21, about 18 hours after the seven babies were born, she
went back into surgery to control her abdominal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the surviving babies remained in critical but stable
condition, said Dr. Patti Savrick, a clinical assistant professor
of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and the children's
primary care pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Savrick said ultrasounds of the babies' heads Monday had yielded
``dramatic good news'' _ they had no bleeding or cysts in their
brains.
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding to the brain is probably the most reliable single
predictor of future neurological problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology service at Texas
Children's Hospital and the newborn-premature service at St.
Luke's, said that 20 percent to 25 percent of babies as small as
the Chukwu octuplets experience bleeding to the brain, which
increases the risk for long-term complications such as cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the premature infants' progress, they are likely to
stay in the hospital until their due date of about April 1, Savrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest baby, a girl named Odera who weighed only 10.3
ounces at birth, died Sunday of heart and lung failure. The
largest, a boy named Jioke, weighed 26 ounces. None is expected to
gain weight until about two weeks old, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving babies' chances for survival are now about 92
percent, Weisman said, based on the hospital's treatment of 2,500
premature infants during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Texas Children's treats about 250 babies born between
25 and 29 weeks gestation, said Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   The seven surviving babies include five girls and two boys.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, first-born Ebuka, sixth-born Ikem and eighth-born
Gorom were on ventilators, while second-born Chidi, third-born
Echerem, fourth-born Chima and seventh-born Jioke were breathing on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   At the family's request, no photographs or videotapes of the
babies have been released to news media, hospital officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Odobi, were born in Nigeria
and are naturalized U.S. citizens. Odobi, a respiratory therapist
in Houston, is expected to return to work by the end of the week,
Kirshon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although neither St. Luke's nor Texas Children's has solicited
gifts for the family, donations and good wishes have come from
around the world, hospital administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   Donations may be sent to the Chukwu Family Fund, St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital, 6900 Fannin, Suite 440, Houston, Texas 77030.
For more information, call 713-791-3137 or 713-770-2196.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Tuesday that after
the holidays she will urge Houston-area corporations to donate such
things as a van and a larger house than the family's four-bedroom
dwelling in southwest Houston.

COMMENTARY: ACQUITTING HIMSELF WELL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Going for impeachment in the House, Republicans
behaved like giddy hedonists. They did what felt good, heedless of
harm to their party or the country.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's Bill's turn. And this is a man who will not be
outdone in the hedonism department. After the GOP's selfish
performance, why shouldn't the president do what feels good? Why
should he start putting the interests of his party and country
ahead of his own at this late date?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the White House is lying low these days, letting
senators brush up on the Federalist Papers and chew over a censure
deal. Clinton aides are telling senators that the president wants a
deal by the time he gives the State of the Union address on Jan.
19.
</P>
<P>
   But some who know Bill Clinton wonder if the Hot Springs
gambler, the man who loves life on the edge, the pol who always
defies impossible odds, is tempted by a bolder play: a full
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   If the president goes for an acquittal, he will be doing what he
does best: campaigning and spinning. But if he succumbs to the
Senate demand to admit that he lied, he will be doing what he does
worst: telling the truth and accepting the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton loves playing the numbers _ be it polls or congressional
vote tallies. He knows there is little chance the Republicans will
get the 67 votes needed to convict.
</P>
<P>
   The high-roller in the Oval Office might look at it this way: If
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has scorned Clinton in the past
and who endorsed the upbraiding of the president as ``immoral'' _
if this senator is looking for a censure deal, why shouldn't the
president go one better? If Clinton could swing an acquittal, he'd
have a whole year to drive home the case that history must nullify
the House judgment as a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Democratic senator Tom Harkin and others have been
egging on White House lawyers to have the brass to go for the gold.
``Quit pushing for censure,'' Harkin said he told them: ``You don't
want to be the only president in history to be impeached and have
it hang over your head the rest of your life. You want to be
exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have been busily deconstructing the two
articles of impeachment passed by the House. They are confident
that they can surmount the obstruction-of-justice count, which is
largely based on conflicting testimony from a host of witnesses,
including the president, Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Vernon
Jordan. And while they risk further Republican fury over legal
hair-splitting, White House lawyers are also prepared to argue that
Clinton did not lie before the grand jury. Most important of all,
the president himself still insists that he didn't lie and thinks
he can convince the Senate that he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the essence of the case: When Clinton testified
before the grand jury in August, he didn't deny having any sexual
contact with Ms. Lewinsky. He admitted having had an
``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with her that involved
sex, just not sex as defined in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit. As absurd as it seems, his guilt _ and
presidency _ may rest on whether Clinton directly touched Ms.
Lewinsky's breast and genitals with the intent of arousing or
gratifying her.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be that tough for the president to prove that his
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky fit his own convoluted (and
selfish) interpretation of the definition of sexual relations. It
may sound tortured to anyone else, but then Clinton's encounters
with the former intern were truly tortured and full of strange
boundaries. And the House prosecutors will have to build a much
stronger case than they did in their final report.
</P>
<P>
   The president may also be emboldened to fight because he knows
that Kenneth Starr might still prosecute him after he leaves office
if he agrees to admit to lying in return for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans in the Senate are not talking openly,
as some in the House did, of casting out the president. But they
are talking about ``censure with teeth'' and forcing Clinton to
admit he lied under oath. White House lawyers say the chances of
that are zip. Unless, hmmmmm, could the White House be lying when
it says the president will never admit to a lie?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, it's convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   An acquittal would be the artful dodger's greatest dodge. And as
an ending, certainly, it would have a delicious symmetry.
</P>

 &HT;    At Friedman's, fewer big dogs amble in during NBA lockout
 &HT;    (EDS: RESENDING to sports category for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An NBA lockout can really foul up the sales of $850
alligator skins, especially in size 17.
</P>
<P>
   This season, like most in recent memory, could have been
larger-than-life for Atlanta-based Friedman's Shoes, a modern-day
cobbler to the flashy tastes of pro basketball players and other
high-rolling athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a National Basketball Association lockout that's
putting the squeeze on spending by the loafer-loving players, the
shoe shop's order list has been short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're usually on our sixth reorder of the top shoes by now,
but we stopped at two shipments this year,'' said Brett Teilhaber,
holding up a camel-and-bone mule he helped design based on the
fancies of Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Just counting the missed home games of the Atlanta Hawks,
Friedman's is more than a dozen major sales shy of a regular year.
Every Hawks game brings a towering crowd of big spenders from the
visiting team, and sometimes they'll drop $50,000 in a single
shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't bus them over, I send a van over to the Omni and
pick them up,'' said Bruce Teilhaber, Brett's father and owner of
Friedman's, which has adjacent stores for men and women on Mitchell
Street downtown and a third store in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Teilhaber has been courting the oversized needs of pro
ball players since the 1960s, around the time Joe Namath was
getting ready to hit the NFL and long before big-footed guys had
any fashion choices beyond wingtips and clunky cap toes.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teilhaber's father-in-law, Phillip Friedman, founded the
business in 1929 as a used-shoe store and repair shop. About 25
years ago, Teilhaber said he realized men's feet were getting
larger and he talked manufacturers into making bigger shoes.
</P>
<P>
   His break in the pro sports circuit came in the late 1960s when
football players dropped by after a game between the Atlanta
Falcons and San Francisco 49ers. ``Big guys know other big guys,''
Teilhaber said. ``From there, we got some hockey players and then
it spread to basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's was filling a huge niche by carrying shoes up to size
13, which was large in those days. ``But then John Havlicek of the
Boston Celtics came in and needed a size 14 narrow,'' said
Teilhaber, who's still lamenting 20-odd years later that he
couldn't fill the order. ``It killed me. I couldn't sleep that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's, which has three stores in Atlanta, would be hard
pressed not to find a fit today. Three floors of the downtown men's
store bulge with big shoes in all styles and widths, including
lime, orange and olive tones popular with NBA stars. Shoes that fit
Shaq's size 22 foot alone stand 15 boxes high and almost as wide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the so-far aborted season, stars like O'Neal are still
ordering shoes from Friedman's, said Teilhaber, who estimates sales
to NBA players make up 15 percent of his business. The sales that
are suffering are those to the lesser-known players and the
first-round draft picks, he said. But even the big stars could cut
back on their shoe budget, with recent endorsement cancellations by
Nike and Fila USA.
</P>
<P>
   Teilhaber is staying upbeat, though, counting on catalog sales
and a new Web site to reach those players that aren't in town this
season. And there are always celebrities like Don King, who once
dropped $65,000 at Friedman's on 110 pairs of shoes. ``This NBA
thing is hurting us, but we're still doing fine,'' he said.
``There' are plenty of big people out there.''

 &HT;    Miller offers advice on passing a lottery
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Zell Miller lent his support Tuesday to a
proposed South Carolina lottery for education, by meeting with that
state's governor-elect, Jim Hodges, to give him pointers on how to
win popular support for a state-run lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges said he planned to take Miller's advice to stress to the
public that all lottery proceeds would flow to education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take a lesson from Georgia,'' Hodges said. ``If we begin
piecemealing the lottery money, education suffers, and the lottery
suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller acknowledged that a new lottery in a neighboring state
might cut money outsiders spend on the Georgia Lottery, which funds
HOPE scholarships, pre-kindergarten and school technology. But he
dismissed that as a reason for withholding his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at how many young South Carolina children will be
helped by the money,'' Miller said at a press conference after his
meeting with Hodges. He said Georgia would need to devise
attractive new games to keep its revenues up.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia doesn't have precise numbers on how much outsiders spend
on its lottery. Neither Miller or Rebecca Paul, president of the
Georgia Lottery, would speculate on how that spending would change
if neighboring states started lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way, way too early to tell,'' Paul said. ``How much they
impact us depends on how they are structured.''
</P>
<P>
   The types of games offered and commitment to advertising
influence a lottery's popularity. ``There are things they can do,''
Paul said. ``I'm sure not going to tell them what those are.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Miller met with Alabama's governor-elect, Don
Siegelman, to offer him advice on setting up an Alabama lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Both Siegelman and Hodges campaigned on the promise to imitate
Georgia's lottery, Miller's signature program.

   Both states plan statewide referendums on the issue in the year
2000. Their lotteries wouldn't begin operating before 2001.

   Hodges said he planned to use lottery money to reduce class
sizes, establish college scholarships and fund pre-kindergarten.
``A lottery carefully crafted will help education in South
Carolina,'' Hodges said. ``We're tired of being 50th in several
(education) categories.''

 &HT;    Parking fee hike at park slowed
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Members of Stone Mountain Park's oversight committee
on Tuesday postponed a decision on a parking fee increase, saying
they want the private company that manages much of the park to
justify the hike.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Dollar City, the theme park developer that started
managing park attractions this year, wants to raise the daily
parking pass from $6 to $7 and the annual parking pass from $25 to
$30. The last increase _ from $5 to $6 _ came in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to arbitrarily increase prices based on limited
information,'' said Lonice Barrett, a member of the Stone Mountain
Memorial Association Board and commissioner of the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   He and other board members said they received information
packages about the increase late Monday afternoon. ``I want to see
a package more reassuring to me,'' said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   The board is scheduled to vote next month on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul van Leeuwen, executive vice president for Silver Dollar
City, said his company this year spent $3.3 million on park
improvements and $1.3 million at the Evergreen Conference Center
and Resort at the park. He said the added parking revenue would
finance improvements such as ``significant increases in the laser
show'' that include enhanced fireworks and a new sound and light
tower.
</P>
<P>
   He said the parking fee increases _ on about 600,000 annual
daily parking passes and 60,000 yearly passes _ would raise close
to $1 million a year, about 2 percent of the park's $45 million to
$50 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Dollar City has increased prices from $3.50 to $4 for
admission to the plantation, the railroad and the wildlife center
at the park. But van Leeuwen said the cost of a 10-attraction
ticket has dropped from $25 to $18.
</P>
<P>
   Under the lease agreement with the state, Silver Dollar City
pays the authority a base payment of $9.5 million annually and 3
percent of all revenues over $44 million. The state still manages
all natural areas of the park, provides police service and
maintains roads and other infrastructure.

POISON KILLS NEIGHBORHOOD PETS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Kawadler sensed something was amiss Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Crows filled the backyard of her home in Milton, Mass., although
it wasn't trash collection day. Looking out the kitchen window, she
saw one big black bird and then a second suddenly fall off their
tree perches and flop to the ground, cawing noisly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to my husband, `I think somebody is trying to poison
them,' '' Kawadler recalled. But when she turned back to the
window, the birds had vanished and she gave it no more thought.
</P>
<P>
   Before day's end, the Kawadlers' nine-year-old mixed Labrador
Retriever was barely clinging to life and their daughter's two dogs
_ a great dane and golden retriever that the Kawadlers were
babysitting while their daughter was in the hospital giving birth
to twins -- were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The three pets were victims of what police Tuesday described as
a case of serial poisoning that also had taken the lives of two
other dogs in the Pope's Pond neighborhood and possibly the life of
a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   All the dogs apparently had eaten meat laced with strychnine, a
poison used to kill rodents, after being let out in pens or yards
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as police expanded their search for the poisoner, news
of the killings shook the upscale neighborhood, where large yards
and ample green space have attracted many families that own dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who don't own dogs expressed shock at the cruelty of
the crimes, while pet owners vowed to keep their dogs on a short
leash. Some called on neighbors to check on the wellbeing of their
four-footed friends, while the families of the poisoned dogs
grieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Kawadlers turned over to Milton police a remnant of what
resembles a meatball, encasing a poison pellet, which their dog
Lucy had carried in to their Craig Street home from their fenced
backyard the night she fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrendous death they suffer,'' said Captain Robert
Fennessey, deputy director of law enforcement for the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ``They go into
violent spasms, they can't breathe and they are vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fennessey said his agency usually gets 5,000 reports of animal
abuse a year, but few involve poisonings and even fewer involve
poisonings of such a large number of pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually what we find is somebody has a gripe with a neighbor
and one or two pets are involved,'' he said. ``Something like this,
which is a serial killer, there is something more.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like a movie sleuth trying to identify a serial killer by
getting inside his head, Fennessey tried to speculate about what
might motivate a dog killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could want to rid the neighborhood of dogs, so they can
do things in the night,'' he said. ``It could be just somebody who
doesn't like dogs and wants to see them suffer and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy, the Kawadlers' dog, remained in intensive care at Angell
Memorial Hospital Tuesday. She may have survived up to this point
only because she ate less of the tainted meat, which either had
been left or tossed into yards, police and the family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kawadler said the 50-pound dog has been her husband Gerald's
constant companion for nearly a decade, often nestling by his feet
beneath the desk as he worked in the family's heating and
air-conditioning business.
</P>
<P>
   The Kawadlers' son, Stuart, said his father would even take Lucy
to business conferences and record her as being present in his
minutes of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At the office, Lucy would share a turkey pocket with the
receptionist's dog everyday for lunch, except Friday, when they
feasted on Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a funny dog,'' Stuart said. ``I don't know what kind of
demented mind could do this. They're not just pets, they're part of
our family.
</P>
<P>
   Other families had equally strong feelings for their poisoned
pets.
</P>
<P>
   Molly, a six-year-old Labrador belonging to the Phillips family,
just around the corner from the Kawadlers, had gone on many family
vacations _ to Cape Cod, to New Hampshire, to Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends kind of expected if they invited me anywhere, Molly
was going to be there, too,'' chuckled Gary Phillips, as he fondly
recalled Molly. ``Yeah, she was a dog, but she was a great member
of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Minard Culpepper said Sheba, his family's seven-year-old German
Shephard, usually barked when she wanted to come back into the
house from the fenced yard.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when Culpepper didn't hear anything after what
seemed like an hour Saturday evening, he went out to check on her
and found her dead, blood trickling from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very protective dog,'' Culpepper said. ``She would
bark at strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another owner of a dog possibly poisoned by the serial killer,
Susan Derrick, lives near Curry College, about a half-mile from the
three-block area where the other families live. She said her
six-month-old golden retriever, Rusty, was timid and would not have
wandered far from her hilltop house.
</P>
<P>
   That would have meant someone would have had to come near the
house to leave the poison, since the house is set 150 feet back
from the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little more frightening to think someone would have to
come up here to do it,'' said Derrick.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty also had violent seizures before dying on the kitchen
floor. But Fennessey of the MSPCA said her body already has been
cremated, so tests could not be conducted to confirm poisoning.
Meanwhile, Barbara Kawadler's voice shuddered with sorrow as she
recalled having to tell her daughter her dogs had died only hours
after her daughter had given birth. Then it swelled with anger at
the thought her own family could no longer feel safe in their home:
The poisoned meat was placed in the yard, she noted, where her
grandchildren often play on the swing set when they visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a child who picked it up, and if it was a
child, they would have called it homicide,'' said Kawadler.
</P>
<P>
   The MSPCA is offering a $1,000 reward and the Kawadlers $500 for
information leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of the
person or people responsible for the poisonings. People should call
the MSPCA at 1-800-628-5808 or Milton Police at 617-698-3800 with
information.

MOTHER OF OCTUPLETS TO BE RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nkem Chukwu, who gave birth to octuplets this month,
is scheduled to be released from the hospital Wednesday, while her
seven surviving babies have passed an important medical test and
are now given a 92 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, 29, is still anemic but slowly gaining strength, said
Dr. Brian Kirshon, her attending physician and maternal-fetal
medicine specialist and high-risk obstetrician at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very weak from being bedridden for such a long time,''
said Kirshon, who delivered the world's first octuplets born alive.
The first baby was born naturally Dec. 8 and the other seven by
Caesarean section Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu entered St. Luke's in early October and had been confined
to bed for six weeks before the first delivery.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 21, about 18 hours after the seven babies were born, she
went back into surgery to control her abdominal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the surviving babies remained in critical but stable
condition, said Dr. Patti Savrick, a clinical assistant professor
of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and the children's
primary care pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Savrick said ultrasounds of the babies' heads Monday had yielded
``dramatic good news'' _ they had no bleeding or cysts in their
brains.
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding to the brain is probably the most reliable single
predictor of future neurological problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology service at Texas
Children's Hospital and the newborn-premature service at St.
Luke's, said that 20 percent to 25 percent of babies as small as
the Chukwu octuplets experience bleeding to the brain, which
increases the risk for long-term complications such as cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the premature infants' progress, they are likely to
stay in the hospital until their due date of about April 1, Savrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest baby, a girl named Odera who weighed only 10.3
ounces at birth, died Sunday of heart and lung failure. The
largest, a boy named Jioke, weighed 26 ounces. None is expected to
gain weight until about two weeks old, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving babies' chances for survival are now about 92
percent, Weisman said, based on the hospital's treatment of 2,500
premature infants during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Texas Children's treats about 250 babies born between
25 and 29 weeks gestation, said Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   The seven surviving babies include five girls and two boys.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, first-born Ebuka, sixth-born Ikem and eighth-born
Gorom were on ventilators, while second-born Chidi, third-born
Echerem, fourth-born Chima and seventh-born Jioke were breathing on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   At the family's request, no photographs or videotapes of the
babies have been released to news media, hospital officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Odobi, were born in Nigeria
and are naturalized U.S. citizens. Odobi, a respiratory therapist
in Houston, is expected to return to work by the end of the week,
Kirshon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although neither St. Luke's nor Texas Children's has solicited
gifts for the family, donations and good wishes have come from
around the world, hospital administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   Donations may be sent to the Chukwu Family Fund, St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital, 6900 Fannin, Suite 440, Houston, Texas 77030.
For more information, call 713-791-3137 or 713-770-2196.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Tuesday that after
the holidays she will urge Houston-area corporations to donate such
things as a van and a larger house than the family's four-bedroom
dwelling in southwest Houston.

MASSACHUSETTS TOPS PREVIOUS HOME-SALE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts needed only 11 months this year to set an
annual record for home sales, according to figures released Tuesday
by the Massachusetts Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   A strong November pushed total sales _ detached single-family
houses and condominiums _ to 56,114. That eclipsed last year's
record of 56,039, set over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the National Association of Realtors reported an
``exceptionally strong'' November, with sales on track to beat the
national record set last year.
</P>
<P>
   On both the state and national levels, the same factors were
cited for the November strength: a strong national economy, high
consumer confidence, low mortgage rates, and a balmy autumn that
put would-be home buyers in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk of record home sales need not bring disturbing
comparisons to the 1980s, when an explosive rise in sales was
matched by a precipitous decline, according to the Mass.
Association of Realtors' new president.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dougherty, who is also marketing director for Carlson Real
Estate/Better Homes &AMP; Gardens, said recent growth has been strong
but measured. He said the average selling price of single-family
houses in the state during the first 11 months of 1998 was 9.3
percent higher than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a runaway market with consumers getting
involved in competitive bidding with reckless abandon,'' Dougherty
said. From 1986 to 1988, by contrast, prices climbed on the order
of 30 percent each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty and the national group both predicted a strong 1999
for real estate sales but doubted it would be another record year.
Continued _ if slower _ economic growth is expected to keep demand
strong, while interest rates remain low.
</P>
<P>
   State figures showed a 6.8 percent increase in the sale of
single-family houses in November over the same month in 1997. Condo
sales were up 17.4 percent this November from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Single-family house and condo sales were both off in November
from the previous month, by 5.7 percent and 7.1 percent
respectively. But residential sales routinely dip from October to
November as the weather cools and the holidays draw near.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the average selling price for single-family homes in
the state rose 2.5 percent from November 1997 ($205,362) to
November 1998 ($210,504). The corresponding increase for condos was
2.7 percent ($127,058 to $130,453).
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, home sales rose 2.7 percent in November over October
on a seasonally adjusted basis, the national realtors association
said. With the strong November results, the group hiked its 1998
sales projection to 4.78 million, up 13.5 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Massachusetts sales topped out in 1987 at 49,625.
That record stood until 1996 and new records followed in 1997 and
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Donna McAuliffe, a broker in the Wellesley office of Hunneman &AMP;
Co._ Coldwell Banker, said that while the market has been
``unbelievably strong'' overall, she detected ``a slight slowdown''
in recent months at the highest end. She referred to houses selling
for $1.2 million and more in wealthy suburbs like Lincoln and
Weston.
</P>
<P>
   People buying a house in the $250,000 to $500,000 range are
affected by interest rates, McAuliffe said. She theorized that
buyers of the most expensive homes base their decisions more on the
stock market. She suggested the 20 percent drop in share prices at
the end of the summer, even though the stock market has since made
up the loss, introduced an element of caution into the thinking of
the wealthiest buyers.

NEW FILM, NEW CHAPTER IN A STORIED UNION
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: For release Sunday, Jan. 3)

<P>
   ``Console me! I am inconsolable!'' _ Anna, in ``Private
Confessions''
</P>
<P>
   This bit of dialogue is Ingmar Bergman at his most resonant, a
slightly ridiculous cry of pain, the ridicule softened by an
implicit sympathy. How can you not sympathize with someone so
pitifully exposed in the contradictions of being human?
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Private Confessions,'' which opens Wednesday, is
classic Bergman territory as well. An unhappily married minister's
wife has embarked on an affair with a young seminarian; torn
between guilt at lying and a belief in the essential truth of her
love, she turns to an old friend, her confirmation priest, whose
counsel will alter her life in unintended ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private Confessions'' is enormously moving, with a moral and
emotional gravity that has become increasingly rare in movies.
Watching it, I felt the relief I always used to feel settling into
a Bergman film _ that here at last was a filmmaker willing to admit
how hard the most ordinary life can be, and how alarmingly drastic.
</P>
<P>
   But this film has two makers. Written by Bergman and directed by
Liv Ullmann, ``Private Confessions'' opens a new chapter in a
relationship that began more than three decades ago, when Ms.
Ullmann played opposite Bibi Andersson in what is probably
Bergman's most famous movie, ``Persona.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who is 80, turned to directing theater full time 15
years ago, but he continues to write films. Ms. Ullmann will direct
a second Bergman screenplay _ the Swedish title means ``Faithless''
_ later this year.
</P>
<P>
   She says she was so delighted when Bergman asked her to make
``Private Confessions'' that she accepted without even reading it.
``This is a circle that has closed, because I missed working with
Ingmar, and this meant working with him in a different way,'' she
said on a recent visit to New York, where she keeps an apartment.
Once Bergman directed Ms. Ullmann, now she directs him. Given her
central place in his films and his life, it seems fitting that she
should.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappily married couple in ``Private Confessions'' are
named Bergman, and they first appeared in ``Best Intentions,''
which Bergman wrote and Bille August directed in 1992. With both
scripts, Bergman continues the task he began in 1984 with ``Fanny
and Alexander'': to come to terms with his troubled childhood as
the son of a harshly punitive Lutheran minister and a mother who
kept him at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bergman is considered an autobiographical filmmaker, it
was only when he became involved with Ms. Ullmann that his work
made a decisive shift in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``Persona'' (1966), he turned deeply inward, and
the nine films they made together over the next 12 years, when
Bergman's film career was at its peak, reflect his most private
concerns. More than any other Bergman actress, Ms. Ullmann embodies
his core themes of anguish, loss and failure _ the anguish of
everyday life, the radical loss of faith, and the failure of love
to console.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Persona,'' Ms. Ullmann embodies Bergman himself. Here, the
anguish of everyday life includes a tormenting sense of
inauthenticity. This is what causes the breakdown of the actress
Elizabet Vogler, played by Ms. Ullmann, and plunges her into
silence. Elizabet's defining gift, the ability to portray the real,
is also the root of her alienation: She feels fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann's luminous blue eyes and softly rounded face are
uniquely suited to expressing the most naked vulnerability, but in
``Persona'' nearly the opposite happens. Elizabet's silence, which
begins as a traumatized rejection of the world, gradually becomes a
form of power.
</P>
<P>
   As Elizabet's cheerful young nurse, Alma (Ms. Andersson), starts
compulsively spilling the contents of her own life, Elizabet
silently sops them up until nothing is left. In the movie's most
famous shot, the women's faces fuse: Alma has been subsumed into
Elizabet, she has become the stronger woman's creature _ as an
actress may become the creature of her director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, the part he gave me was a silent person,'' Ms.
Ullmann says of her first Bergman role. ``I was Norwegian, I
couldn't even have tried to speak Swedish, I was probably too
scared to talk at all. But I did recognize him somehow, and I knew
that I was him. That was my great understanding at 25. I didn't
really understand my part, because I was playing someone 40 years
old. But I knew it was Ingmar, and my instinct explained it for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann and Bergman fell in love while making ``Persona.''
Both were married but left their mates and had a daughter, Linn. In
his 1987 autobiography, ``The Magic Lantern,'' Bergman says simply,
``Liv and I were overwhelmed by passion,'' and describes building a
house for them on Faro (pronounced Fora), his beloved island
retreat off Sweden's Baltic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann's recollection is more complicated. ``We were
walking on this stony beach and he said, `I have to tell you, this
night I had a dream that we were painfully connected.' You know, I
more or less fell in love with that. I mean, Ingmar Bergman is
painfully connected to me?''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs at the memory of a young actress's susceptibility to
the tortured blandishments of a great artist. ``Well, I regretted
it and went back to Norway, and he came to Norway and got me back
to Sweden. And then I became pregnant, and I left him again. Then
he asked me to come back; he had written a film for a pregnant
woman. So I went back, and that was `Hour of the Wolf.' We never
married. I moved to Faro, where I lived for five years. It was
there we did `Shame,' and then `The Passion of Anna,' but that was
toward the end. And then it was over, that part, and I took my
child and went back to Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's description of their end has the terse poetry of an
epitaph: ``She stayed a few years. We fought our demons as best we
could. When she left, we knew.'' Ms. Ullmann's description of their
serial parting in ``Changing,'' her best-selling 1976 memoir, has
the humor, passion, sadness and desperation of a Bergman movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the practical matters one had to consider in order to
break out,'' she notes drily. To get off Faro, there were four
gates to open, drive through and close, and a ferry to catch, but
``our fights never coincided with its schedule.'' Long before this
obstacle course could be completed, they would make up. Once he
ordered a taxi plane to expedite her departure, but ``We became
friends again, by the suitcases.''
</P>
<P>
   When the final parting came, they did the only thing they could:
pretend it wasn't a parting at all. ``Just a short trip to
Norway,'' she writes. With everything packed and the bags in the
car, they remained carefully casual. It was left to their
housekeeper to step behind a curtain and weep.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Bergman movie this story brings to mind, of course, is
``Scenes from a Marriage.'' Made in six parts for Swedish
television and trimmed to just under three hours for theatrical
release in 1973, it has none of the visual panache of the films
that preceded it: the elegant black and white severity of
``Persona,'' the rough documentary chiaroscuro of ``Shame,'' the
gorgeous reds in ``Cries and Whispers'' that turn every room into a
bloody chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Shot, like those movies, by the great cinematographer Sven
Nykvist, ``Scenes from a Marriage'' looks as unromantic as the
fraying union that is its subject. Full of two-shots and close-ups
of Ms. Ullmann and her co-star, Erland Josephson, the film is
relentless in its intimacy: embarrassing, revelatory, painful,
slyly funny and occasionally sublime.
</P>
<P>
   When he tells her he is leaving her for another woman, we hear
him but the camera watches her, avidly studying her every reaction.
Working fast, with little rehearsal, Ms. Ullmann has never been
subtler or more fearless. Neither has Bergman's writing, with every
line at perfect pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking thing about ``Scenes From a Marriage''
is how immediate it feels. Much of ``Persona'' remains powerful,
but there are moments when its stylish solemnity looks dated and
naive, the perfect template for ``Sprockets,'' Mike Myers' wicked
``Saturday Night Live'' send-up of art-film pretensions. But
``Scenes from a Marriage'' hasn't aged five minutes in its 26
years. Now, as then, it reads like a blueprint of the human heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman made the film when he was 55 and in the first years of
his fifth and only lasting marriage, to Ingrid von Rosen, a close
friend. He has said that he wrote the movie ``in order to tidy up a
huge wardrobe of experiences of different kinds,'' his own and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann enabled Bergman to express his deepest anxieties in
many films, but she held out another possibility. Ms. Ullmann often
signifies a kind of wholeness for Bergman _ something that seems
undamaged and therefore implies hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scenes from a Marriage'' reconciles, however tentatively, his
conflicted perceptions about men and women: For the first time,
consolation is possible. Although he and Ms. Ullmann made three
more films together, this was their last truly successful
collaboration. In its emotional maturity, ``Scenes from a
Marriage'' anticipated the work that they are doing now.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who should know better have a tendency to call Ms.
Ullmann's ``Private Confessions'' a Bergman movie, as if she had
dutifully executed his detailed wishes. In other words, as if she
were his creature. But as their professional and personal history
makes clear, she has not been that in years, if indeed she ever
was.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' Bergman wrote the part of the young
mother _ his mother _ for Ms. Ullmann; when she declined to play
it, he was furious. She says she regrets now not being part of his
last film. ``But I suddenly couldn't do it. I couldn't be ashamed
any more. I couldn't be guilty. Because I'm not anguished the way
he is. He struggles with this anguish and with the difficulty of
being a human being. Life for me is very different. He stays on his
island, and I want to travel the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann was breaking out once more, this time in a direction
that would eventually bring her back to him. By 1991 she was
writing and directing ``Sofie,'' her first feature and a good one,
about a happy marriage and an unhappy one and the links between
them. ``I called Ingmar from the airport and told him. He said,
`Oh, my god.''' Her second film, ``Kristin Lavransdatter,'' based
on Sigrid Undset's epic novel of medieval Norway, became that
country's ``Titanic,'' seen at least once by more than half the
population.
</P>
<P>
   When Bergman offered her ``Private Confessions,'' she wondered
if he would try to look over her shoulder. They argued over a few
things in the rough cut, but in the end, he not only respected her
choices but embraced them.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Private Confessions'' was shot by Sven Nykvist, it
doesn't especially look like a Bergman film. It has its own look,
plain yet suggestive and charismatic, like a Hopper painting _ or
like the remarkable face of its star, Pernilla August.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a kind of intimate intensity that seems to radiate
from her. As the beautifully shaded performances in both ``Sophie''
and this film make clear, Ms. Ullmann, like Bergman, is above all a
director of actors. ``When I started directing,'' she says, ``I
thought: `This is it. The whole 40 years of being an actress have
just been a school for this.' I got a new respect for actors and
how creative they are, and they know that I think that. I don't
think I was always a good mother, but I know I'm a good mother for
actors because I allow them to grow themselves and I don't try to
make a blueprint of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable scenes in ``Private Confessions,''
filmed in a single 10-minute take, is that of the last visit
between Anna Bergman and Jacob, the dying confirmation priest,
played by Max von Sydow. At one point, von Sydow says, ``All these
years I've been thinking about you,'' and stops, apparently unable
to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was in Max's mind,'' Ms. Ullmann says, ``but
suddenly he's starting to cry and he can't get the words. It's
almost a minute before the next word comes. And we are so close, he
knew that I wouldn't stop him, and I knew that he would continue,
and allow Jacob and Max to come together. Because he knew that this
was so right for the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Directors earn moments like that. Bergman once told an
interviewer that his first job was to make his actors feel secure,
because it's the actor who goes in front of the camera and takes
chances. Clearly, Ms. Ullmann is using much that she learned from
him. As a director, she says, ``He's a wonderful audience, he stirs
you up a little, and then he allows the actor to take joy in doing
the work. Because it's not anguish then, it's joy, tremendous
joy.''

   HAMILTON, Scotland _ The sight of sons and daughters standing
beneath the porch light in police custody is not a settling one for
parents in most places, but here it can be.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is the first community in Britain to impose a curfew on
its young people, with special child safety police officers
questioning anyone they know to be under the age of 16 on the
streets after 8 p.m. and taking them home if they cannot supply a
sound reason why they are out.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no one at home _ and in the gritty, hard-living
housing project neighborhoods here, that is often the case _ the
children are taken to a community room set aside for the purpose in
the station house until a family member comes for them.
</P>
<P>
   While the measure has not unexpectedly drawn little praise from
the youngsters themselves, it has met with almost unanimous
approval from parents. Studies by Stirling University show that it
has cut theft and vandalism, crimes associated with youth, by 49
percent and overall crime by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a great success,'' said Anne Gibson, 33, a
resident. ``The streets now are awfully quiet, and you're not
trying to fight your way past cheeky kids if you go out at 9
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Glasgow area has a reputation for having some of
the meanest streets in Britain, the kind of crime that the Hamilton
curfew is aimed at curbing is more of the cheeky kid variety,
youths on street corners marking out territory, smoking and
drinking sweet Buckfast wine made by monks in Devon that sells here
for $6 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening,'' Karen Murphy, 62, said, describing how she
used to be afraid to leave her two-story row house after dark.
``You see four or five kids coming at you, and they may be all
right on their own, but together in a crowd they're more
aggressive. They have no respect for anyone and no fear in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dun Graham, 13, said he and his friends didn't like the police
intrusions, and his sister Melanie, 20, said she sympathized. ``All
they're doing is talking on the street, and they resent the police
stopping them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hamilton Youth Project, Grace Quigley, 33, a counselor,
reported: ``They think the police jump to conclusions when they see
kids standing around. Often it's not abusiveness, it's just
cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague, Lorna Campbell, 31, said the problem wasn't the
youngsters. ``Kids are abusive because that's how their parents
talk to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Started a year ago in three housing projects where some 6,000
people live, the curfew has now been extended to the entire town of
Hamilton, which has a population of 49,000, and been adopted as a
model for programs elsewhere in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new Crime and Disorder Act passed by the British
Parliament in London, communities in England and Wales will now be
empowered to set up programs similar to the one here, which exists
under Scotland's separate legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton experiment has attracted inquiries from law
enforcement agencies in a number of European countries and has been
studied by local academics interested in seeing that it strikes a
balance between crime control and regard for civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   John Orr, the Chief Constable of the Strathclyde County Police,
said he had little time for ``individuals on the minority fringe
who carp and gripe about the so-called alienation of the
generations and denial of children's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study report of the program, he said: ``We do not allow
young people to be in danger in the home, so we shouldn't permit it
in the street. Our hope is that by taking vulnerable and
impressionable youngsters out of harm's way, there will be a double
spinoff. They will be safer, and they won't be tempted to get
caught up in mischief-making or worse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The word ``curfew'' stirs sensitivities, and anyone using it
around the Strathclyde Police will be quickly corrected. ``We call
it the Child Safety Initiative,'' said Louis R. Munn, chief
superintendent in charge of the Hamilton program.
</P>
<P>
   The British Parliament didn't mince words. The part of the new
law that outlines the proposal is called the Child Curfew Section.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is a town with housing projects created in the 1960s
for people driven out of Glasgow by urban renewal, and some of
these areas have become caught up in more than just teen-agers
drinking cheap wine, scrawling graffiti on buildings and
terrorizing passers-by. In January in the nearby project of
Easterside a 13-year-old boy became the youngest person ever to die
of a heroin overdose in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about getting kids off the street, it's more
about helping parents,'' said Joe Lowe, a local councilman who has
been a vocal champion of the plan in the Fairhill project he
represents. He said that many parents had told him that before the
curfew they had no way of controlling their own children's
whereabouts at night.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the first six months of the Hamilton project, Orr
said, ``Some of the situations my officers come across beggar
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a 9-year-old girl was found wandering in a cul-de-sac at
night this year dressed only in her underwear and dressing gown.
``This little girl was upset and told the officers that her mother
was dead,'' he said. ``When my officers took her home, they found
her mother dead all right _ dead drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr said that another 9-year-old, a boy, was found out in winter
weather underdressed and that when officers took him home, there
was no one there. ``His mum was traced at the bingo, and his dad
was at the pub.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the 280 children escorted home during the six
months of what was then a weekend-only curfew went along
peacefully, he said. Five were subject to criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Munn said the police had difficulties at first persuading
officers to take up the assignment. ``We call them child safety
officers, and at first there was a lot of reluctance because they
saw it as a being kiddy cops, just taking kids home to parents,''
he said. ``We had a big selling job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Constables Pat Duffy, 35, and William Simpson, 33, didn't need
to be sold. ``It's always been a problem getting kids to trust
police, and now they're beginning to,'' said Duffy, himself the
father of two children.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks into their evening foot patrol, they ran across
the familiar faces of Stacy Falconer, 8, Thomas Allen, 10, and
Debbie Montgomery, 12. The youngsters were standing beneath a
street light rubbing their hands in the clammy cold, and the
officers greeted them cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You be getting home now,'' Simpson said. ``And remember to
stay close together,'' his partner added. They waved at the
officers as they sprinted away.

TEXAS AGENCY FOR THE BLIND AGREES TO PAY EX-WORKER $50,000 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Jamestown, N.Y.) 
 
By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Commission for the Blind has agreed to
pay $50,000 to a former employee in Houston who said she was
harassed for her own blindness and denied aids to overcome her
disability.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Tuesday the settlement
resolves the first such case nationally in which it found that a
government agency discriminated against the disabled individuals it
is charged with helping.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was forged in out-of-court mediation after the
Justice Department investigation determined that the Texas agency
had violated the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the hell my husband and I have lived for the past six
years will make things better for the people in Texas,'' Joanna
States said when reached late Tuesday at her current home in
Jamestown, N.Y. ``It's really been unreal. I had to leave Texas in
order to get a part-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   The state commission, however, continues to deny wrongdoing and
said it settled only to save the cost of a lengthy court fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? It does look ironic. On the other hand it
wasn't true,'' said Terry Murphy, executive director of the state
commission. ``We are not an organization that goes around
discriminating against people who are blind.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, however, the agency agreed to
compensate States, formerly a secretary at the agency's Houston
office, for at least some of her losses. She left her job under
duress, she complained, after her supervisor criticized her for
using a Braille machine, a cane and a talking clock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she works pushing a linen cart at a Christian-affiliated
hospital where she's thankful her new co-workers have let her show
them what she's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what you can do in order to survive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State's 1993 complaint of harassment and a hostile work
environment sparked the Justice Department's investigation and
findings that such practices were not isolated events within the
agency's workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation has revealed that the commission failed to
make reasonable accommodations to the known disabilities of
individuals, and that it maintains a practice of failing to provide
certain employee manuals and information in accessible formats
(such as Braille and audiotape),'' the civil rights division of the
Justice Department reported last year.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said States has agreed to the settlement. He added that
she had originally sought back salary and damages totaling
$200,000, ``so this is a lot less.''
</P>
<P>
   States said she was contacted earlier Tuesday by one of the
federal lawyers who advised her not to comment to reporters about
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've strictly been advised that I should keep my mouth shut,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former employee, Sharon Fernandez of San Antonio,
however, said in a telephone interview that she has not decided
whether to accept the $5,000 offered for similar claims of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have contacted a lawyer,'' she said. ``There's a couple of
things in there I'm not happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she left the agency after the assistant assigned
to her refused to accommodate her blindness. She said she had sent
government lawyers ample documentation to back up that claim.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she suffers severe visual impairment in her left
eye and lost the other eye years before to illness caused by her
two-month premature birth as a twin in 1948. The babies each
weighed just barely 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another San Antonio employee that federal lawyers said suffered
discrimination, Louis Larralde, had already been reinstated as a
vocational rehabilitation counselor at the time the agreement was
forged. While the Justice Department takes credit for the rehire,
Murphy said it had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settling the discrimination dispute requires Texas
Commission for the Blind to take several steps to prevent
discrimination of its disabled employees in the future. It also
makes clear that most of them are already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``By implementing the agreed upon changes, the Texas Commission
for the Blind has taken a significant step towards ensuring full
and fair employment opportunities for people with vision
impairments,'' Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for
civil rights, said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said about 80 employees, or 13 percent of the
commission's workforce, are blind or visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The commission agreed to make certain all employee manuals,
training materials and other printed information is provided also
in Braille, large print or on computer disc.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has designated a person to specifically handle
disability discrimination complaints under the Americans with
Disabilities Act and refer to independent mediators those cases
that aren't resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the agency must evaluate the needs of its employees in a
timely way and make sure all necessary equipment is provided. All
current and future employees must additionally be trained about the
rights and needs of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to approval by the Texas Attorney
General. Ward Tisdale, spokesman for outgoing Attorney General Dan
Morales, did not return phone calls as to whether that is likely
before Morales leaves office next month.

   TY TY, Ga. _ Ten years ago, Wayne Williams, a peanut farmer
here, would no more have considered voting for a black man for
Congress than he would have planted his crop in the chill of
December.
</P>
<P>
   Louie Perry Jr., down in Colquitt County, felt pretty much the
same way. So did J.L. Tillman and, truth be told, most every other
white farmer who tills the clay of southwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But in November's election, Williams, Perry, Tillman and tens of
thousands of others voted enthusiastically for Rep. Sanford Bishop,
a moderate black Democrat who won re-election convincingly in a
rural, conservative district where nearly two-thirds of the voters
are white.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop won almost 4 out of every 10 white votes in the 2nd
District of Georgia, an achievement that would have been
inconceivable a few years ago. By comparison, David Dinkins won
just a fourth of the white vote in 1989, when he was elected the
first black mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bishop's white supporters acknowledge they had to
overcome deep prejudices to vote for him. ``I just wouldn't have
thought a black man would know enough to do the job,'' Williams
explained. Other white farmers referred to the congressman
matter-of-factly with the coarsest of racial epithets before
explaining what it was they liked so much about him.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a perverse compliment. But whatever whites want to
call Bishop, their willingness to vote for him may signify one of
the most hopeful developments in Southern politics in decades. Many
black politicians have managed to attract white support in urban,
New South areas like Atlanta. But Bishop's electoral success
suggests that even in the most rural and impoverished districts, a
significant number of white Southerners can overcome race as an
absolute obstacle to voting for a black politician who shares their
thinking, votes their interests and hauls home plenty of pork.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the unwillingness of such whites to vote for blacks
has been the cornerstone of redistricting policies aimed at
maximizing minority representation. As legislatures prepare to
reconstitute Congress after the 2000 census, the opponents of such
redistricting view Bishop as the most compelling evidence that
black candidates can win in white districts. Conversely, those who
support race-based redistricting attribute Bishop's success to his
incumbency, which was gained in a majority black district before
the Supreme Court ordered a remapping in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's story does not mean that racism is dead in southwestern
Georgia. Nor does it mean that there are no longer deep racial
disparities in the rural South in income, housing, education and
health care. But it does suggest, some three decades after the
culmination of the civil rights movement, that the racial
bitterness born of forced desegregation has started to fade, and
that old prejudices are giving way to a more pragmatic politics of
racial cooperation and interdependence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no revolution that's occurred down here,'' said Thomas
Chatmon, the son of a black civil rights pioneer who has been
selected by the power structure in Albany, the largest city in the
2nd District, to direct a downtown redevelopment effort. ``It
doesn't show that whites or blacks are willing to be colorblind.
But what it does show is that southwest Georgians are willing to
cohabitate, are willing to work together, that they know that there
must be compromise on both sides in order to move together on our
collective agenda. That's the reality. And absolutely that is
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to see a measure of progress here in the gradual
subjugation of race by the more natural politics of self-interest.
During Bishop's three terms in Congress, large numbers of white
south Georgians have concluded that his accessibility and his
influence _ particularly with other black Democrats in the House _
far outweigh any consideration of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start with I wasn't wild about him, because he was black,''
explained Williams, 55, a lanky third-generation farmer who grows
peanuts and tobacco on 84 acres here. ``So many black people around
here, you just can't count on them. But he went around and made
some talks and we liked the way he talked. I've met him twice and
he talks to you, not above your head. If you have a problem, he'll
help you out with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has earned the fealty of white constituents through his
aggressive advocacy for federal farm programs, balanced budgets,
welfare reform, school prayer and gun ownership. To suit his
district, he has switched positions on issues like the assault
weapons ban, which he first supported and later opposed. He
advertises himself as a conservative, and reinforced that claim by
becoming the only black member of the right-leaning Democratic
caucus known as the Blue Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop also has put his white constituents at ease with an
affable, nonthreatening manner and a determined resistance to
playing the firebrand on racial issues. He has protected military
bases, secured financing for road widenings and historical sites,
and become a regular at local events like the Big Pig Jig in Vienna
and the Rattlesnake Roundup in Whigham. He has even joined the
National Rifle Association and taken up bird hunting, although his
farmer friends report that the doves are never safer than when
Bishop is walking the brush.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his constituents, James Lee Adams, a prominent
white farmer in Camilla, said Bishop made a lasting impression by
using his seat on the Agriculture Committee to persuade black
Democrats and urban Northerners to preserve federal price supports
for peanuts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's questionable whether it would have survived without the
votes he brought to it,'' said Adams, who is chairman of the agency
that administers federal farm programs in Georgia. He added: ``I
think most of us have gotten beyond the white and black issue. We
prefer to focus on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, 70, who farms cotton and peanuts just south of
Moultrie, also cited the peanut program in explaining his support
for Bishop. ``Now when he came in, he didn't know a thing about
peanuts, probably thought they grew on trees,'' Tillman said. ``But
he's educated himself.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Tillman feel about voting for a black man? ``A nigger?''
he asked, finishing the question. ``I couldn't have seen doing it
before, wouldn't even have thought about it. But I think he's done
a lot for farmers, more than any of them up there in a long time.''

TY TY, Georgia: long time.''

<P>
   Similarly, Perry recalled getting a telephone call two years ago
from a friend who urged him to support Bishop's Republican
opponent. ``He said, `What would your Daddy say if he knew you were
voting for a black person?''' Perry said. ``I said, `Well, he would
think I was pretty smart if he knew the man was helping us.'''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the message that Bishop, 51, has promoted in
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who never would have imagined voting for me,
who didn't vote for me the first time,'' he said. ``But the
majority vote their pocketbooks. They understand the precarious
situation that the farming community is in and they'll support
people that help them.'' He added, ``That was actually the key
element of Dr. King's dream, that blacks could be known by the
content of their character rather than the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine blacks were elected to Congress from majority white
districts this year, including several, like Rep. Cynthia McKinney
of suburban Atlanta and Melvin Watt of Charlotte, N.C., who won
with notable white support. But none won in a more unlikely place
than the 2nd District of Georgia. Only 36 percent of the district's
registered voters are black. The largest city, Albany, has but
78,000 residents. While the 31-county district remains marginally
Democratic, whites now support Republicans regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape here is a patchwork of pecan groves, cotton and
peanut fields and quail-hunting plantations interspersed with small
towns built around courthouse squares and cotton gins. This time of
year, with the cotton crop just in, white tufts litter the
roadsides. Blue harvesters churn through the pecan groves, sucking
fallen nuts off the ground and spewing out a mulch of twigs and
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this land was first cleared and planted by slaves, and
the phrase ``plantation mentality'' still resonates with many
blacks. It was in Albany, where asphalt turned to dirt when white
neighborhoods turned to black, that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. encountered some of the staunchest resistance to the civil
rights movement. And while south Georgia now has black police
chiefs and county commissioners, time has not eased all tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, for instance, whites and blacks have feuded over
whether to rename Jefferson Street for King. A black-majority City
Commission approved the change in 1996. Two months after the signs
went up, a newly elected white-majority commission ordered them
down.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are signs of increasing sensitivity. A new
civil-rights museum in Albany opened in November with biracial
backing. A number of the city's civic leaders have started to meet
regularly to discuss racial issues, with one group calling itself
White Men Coming to Terms With Our Own Racism.
</P>
<P>
   But churches and country clubs remain largely segregated, and
whites tend to move out of neighborhoods that become more than 20
percent black, said Michael Rogers, a business professor at Albany
State University who leads the city's Coalition for Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And blacks in the 2nd District, the poorest district in the
state, are nearly twice as likely as whites to have dropped out of
school, more than three times as likely to live in poverty and more
than 10 times as likely to live in homes without adequate plumbing,
census figures show.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Bishop might not seem a natural fit with the farmers
of southwest Georgia. He was raised in Mobile, Ala., the son of a
black college president who demanded that his students register to
vote. At age 10, he defied a Mobile bus driver by sitting in the
whites-only section of an otherwise empty bus.
</P>
<P>
   At Morehouse College in Atlanta, Bishop became an admirer of
King, the school's most famous graduate. He marched in a downtown
civil-rights demonstration, served as student-body president in
1968, the year that King was assassinated, and sang with the
Morehouse glee club at his funeral. After graduating from Emory Law
School, he joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
New York City, and later accepted NAACP help in establishing a
civil-rights law firm in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop served in Georgia's General Assembly from 1977 to 1992,
the year he first ran for Congress. The state legislature,
encouraged by the Bush administration to create majority black
districts, had designed a 2nd District where the voting-age
population was 52 percent black. Bishop defeated a vulnerable white
incumbent in the Democratic primary, and then cruised to victory in
the general election. He won re-election easily in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, however, new lines had been drawn by federal judges
after the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to use
race as a dominant factor in redistricting. By redrawing the lines
to eliminate concentrations of blacks in Macon and Columbus, where
Bishop lived, the judges reduced the district's black voting-age
population to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop moved to Albany and won anyway, with 54 percent of the
vote and an estimated 36 percent of the white vote. This year,
against a capable and adequately financed Republican opponent, Joe
McCormick, he polled even better, winning 57 percent of the total
vote, an estimated 38 percent of the white vote and 98 percent of
the black vote, according to an analysis by Charles Bullock, a
University of Georgia political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop did not, however, do as well with white voters as did
some white Democratic candidates. For example, in the 12 Colquitt
County precincts where at least 90 percent of the registered voters
were white, Gov.-elect Roy Barnes won 53 percent of the vote and
Bishop won 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, A. Lee Parks Jr., the Atlanta lawyer who successfully
challenged the racial foundation of Georgia's redistricting plan,
said that Bishop proved that blacks could be elected to Congress
``without racially biased districts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanford actually represents people without regard to race, and
when he does that people forget his race,'' Parks said. Many black
politicians, he said, alienate white voters by ``communicating that
they prefer their black constituents, that their priority is
serving their black constituents. Often that's what polarizes
elections on racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of race-based redistricting counter that voting
remained racially polarized in Bishop's last two elections. And
they emphasize that a crucial advantage for candidates like Bishop
was that he was first elected in a majority black district and then
took the benefits of incumbency to his new white district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to conclude that we are suddenly a race-blind
electorate,'' said Laughlin McDonald, director of the Southern
office of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the farmer from Moultrie, put it a different way. ``We
haven't arrived yet,'' he said. ``I don't know if you ever arrive,
if you ever wipe every vestige from your mind. But what's most
important sometimes is what direction you're going.''

NEUTRALITY IN ELECTION VOWED FOR INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The head of Indonesia's armed forces has
pledged that the military will be neutral and not try to influence
national elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces' chief, Gen. Wiranto, said the military, which
has played a crucial role in Indonesia's politics, would ``keep an
equal distance to anyone,'' including the governing Golkar party as
well as opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday after meeting with President B.J.
Habibie, he said the military's main role would be to safeguard
security for all political parties to contest the first free
elections since the end of former President Suharto's 32-year
dictatorial rule in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiranto reaffirmed an earlier promise to form a
40,000-strong civilian militia to help keep law and order before
the elections June 7. Voters are to elect a 550-seat House of
Representatives. The election is to be followed in August by a
meeting of the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, which
will choose a new president.

<P>
   BROOKSVILLE, Ala. _ If the Rev. James Henderson has his way, the
division of church and state in this tiny hamlet will be so narrow,
a single Bible verse, ``Love thy neighbor,'' would cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and some 140 other residents of Brooksville, an
unincorporated community in northern Alabama, want to form a town,
but not one in which mortal elected officials would have the power
to hand out liquor licenses, levy taxes and rezone land for strip
malls and industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Henderson said, they want a town guided by the hand of
God. The King James Bible would be the town charter, the Ten
Commandments, its ordinances. The people who live here would look
out for one another, would look in on the elderly, would watch for
children in the crosswalk. They would not buy or sell alcohol or
pornography. They would not steal.
</P>
<P>
   They would vote _ every woman and man _ in the churches instead
of a city hall, but there would probably not be many votes because
the aim of the town would be to preserve the slow life that exists
here, not mess it up with change, said those in favor of this
Bible-based town.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a self-described street preacher who was born in
Brooksville 56 years ago, knows that he is describing what he
considers an ideal community, an almost impossible utopia. But at
least, he said, it would be a place founded on Christian ideals, on
standards of common decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A standard we would hope everybody would live by,'' he said.
``It's so basic. When I was a child in the 1940s and 1950s, we had
a sense of community, built around the church, on people helping
each other. Over the years, that's gotten frayed around the edges.
I've watched the issue of the separation of church and state get
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do, with this little country crossroads,
is bring together the church and state. We want to make life make
sense again, for people.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any opposition to such a town, it has been silent,
as Henderson and a small group of Brooksville residents go about
collecting the signatures on a petition needed to put the decision
of incorporation as a Bible-based town to a vote. An election on
incorporation may come as soon as February, said Hubert Porter, 62,
an engineer and one of those who favor a Bible-based charter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on incorporation, including those at the Alabama League
of Municipalities, have said there are many practical barriers to
such a town, since state laws on incorporation require a town to
have a mayor, and that issues be decided by a council vote.
Henderson has suggested that most issues can be decided by a simple
show of hands in meetings held in church sanctuaries. There would
be no need to spend money on municipal buildings, because residents
would not have to obtain building permits or such things from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who favor a Bible-based charter can see there are a
lot of problems to be worked out, including the legality of such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooksville community includes 600 people at the most _
probably as few as 400, residents said _ and encompasses only about
four square miles. Mostly Baptist, and mostly white, it is a mix of
blue-collar and white-collar workers, farmers, school teachers and
retirees from Decatur and Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hamlet clinging to the remnants _ some would say the
myths _ of the unspoiled Southern community, a place where children
chase fireflies through yards in the summers and people still wave
when they drive past.
</P>
<P>
   But on Highway 67, the strip malls are creeping closer, and
surrounding cities like Priceville have already annexed parts of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a strange situation,'' Porter said. ``We're not
looking for growth, for industry. We're not looking for Wal-Marts.
We like our atmosphere and our community and we want to keep it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinners and nonbelievers would not be excluded from this town,
he said, but they would be expected to abide by its laws even if
they did not embrace the religion behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he will try to turn them to the Lord, as any
evangelical minister would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another pulpit,'' Henderson said. ``Jesus said he loves
the sinner but hates the sin. My whole approach is to get them into
the Kingdom, and it doesn't matter if they're adulterers or
homosexuals or atheists or what.''
</P>
<P>
   The would-be town already has a sign, propped up on Highway 67.
Underneath big red and blue letters that say ``Brooksville Welcomes
You'' is a verse from Matthew 18:20:
</P>
<P>
   ``... where two or three are gathered together in my name there
am I in the midst of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of a Bible-based town said the concept was not
intended to exclude anyone, but was a return to the spirit of this
country's founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can live with Christian principles anywhere in the world,
and there's not a country in the world that has embraced freedom
that has not embraced Christianity first,'' Porter said. ``We're
not trying to make anybody Baptist or Methodist. Just live by
Christian principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had calls from people wanting to come in,
wanting to move here,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents could do what they like with their property, said the
hamlet's residents who support incorporation, just as long as they
live according to the Bible's teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of financing a police force, residents would form a
strong neighborhood watch, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look after each other,'' he said, ``protect our own
property and lives.''

COMMENTARY: NICOLE KIDMAN'S BEHIND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the theater is a temple, it's no surprise that the
most popular faith on Broadway this holiday season is ``The Blue
Room,'' to which pilgrims flock from miles around to worship Nicole
Kidman's tush.
</P>
<P>
   But given the competing prurience on tap this year, anyone who
sees ``The Blue Room'' must be baffled. It's no Starr report. You
pay your money _ even $35 balcony seats are scalped for hundreds _
and all you get is 100 minutes of arch acting-class skits in which
Ms. Kidman's backside (and only her backside) is visible undraped
for about five seconds. The dim lighting hasn't been turned up a
watt since the similar faux-nude tableau in ``Hair'' 30 years ago.
Let the sunshine in _ please!
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall between the show's lurid reputation and its PG-13
content _ as well as that between its status as a highfalutin
cultural event and its slim theatrical rewards _ once more proves
that our waning century's most powerful invention, publicity, can
alter even empirical reality once harnessed to sex to sell a
product. The notoriously rapacious promotional machine of Ms.
Kidman and her husband, Tom Cruise, has pulled off the feat of
making cynical, allegedly sophisticated New Yorkers look like rubes
who shell out big bucks for a carny show that's all smoke and
mirrors once they're inside the tent.
</P>
<P>
   What brought the product, Ms. Kidman, to Broadway? She isn't a
has-been, like the usual TV refugees who turned up as novelty acts
in ``Grease.'' Nor is she in the category of Christian Slater,
currently doing penance in another play, ``Side Man,'' to
re-establish his employability after a highly public detox. And she
doesn't need her paltry Broadway paycheck. (The entire box-office
gross for the 12-week run of ``The Blue Room'' equals roughly a
fifth of what Cruise alone makes per picture.)
</P>
<P>
   Officially, yes, Ms. Kidman simply yearned to return to her
stage roots in a classic. (``The Blue Room'' is an updating of
Arthur Schnitzler, albeit in Cliff Notes form.) The actual motive,
though, is a stalled screen career. Ms. Kidman's recent movies
(``The Peacemaker,'' ``Practical Magic'') didn't set the world on
fire, so it's time to manufacture buzz _ and where cheaper or
easier to do it than on star-and-sex-deprived Broadway, where the
biggest celebrities are ``Lion King'' puppets, vanity productions
can be assembled for a fraction of Hollywood's cost, and only 1,000
seats a night need be sold to earn the accolade ``smash hit''?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blue Room'' agenda was dictated to a compliant Newsweek,
which set the tone for the monkey-see media to follow. Ms. Kidman,
we were told, is no longer ``Mrs. Tom Cruise, a nepotistic status
assigned to her by a twitchy, bitchy Hollywood,'' but a budding
superstar heading for ``what may be a career unlike any other.''
Eager to hop on the ``Blue Room'' gravy train for its own
commercial purposes, Newsweek oversold the sexual come-on, taking a
lead from the British critic, apparently on sabbatical from a
monastery, who had fatuously labeled Ms. Kidman's performance
``pure theatrical Viagra'' at its debut in London. The magazine's
cover announced that ``Nicole Kidman bares all,'' and its article
led with the empty promise that the star would be seen on stage
``in various percentages of undress (including a climactic 100
percent).'' The play's artistic bona fides were similarly hyped:
the director, Sam Mendes, and adaptor, David Hare, lent ``The Blue
Room'' their cachet but not their best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kidman is a good actress. If she had found a stage vehicle
as challenging as her best movie, ``To Die For,'' she might have
had an acting rather than a publicity triumph. Instead she became
one of the few stars of recent seasons to be denied a unanimous
standing ovation on her Broadway opening night.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after, New York critics blew the whistle on the
whole stunt, noting its acute shortfall as both sex show and
cultural event. Too little, too late. Ticket buyers had already
been suckered into spending some $4 million in advance to subsidize
Ms. Kidman's image makeover, and what New Yorker wants to admit
he's been had? A ticket to ``The Blue Room,'' the terminally
tedious club no one can get into, still confirms status, even if
anyone in search of pure theatrical Viagra might have had a better
shot with the Rockettes.

EVEN A MOBSTER NEEDS SOMEONE TO TALK TO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 3) 
(JT) 
 By CHARLES STRUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept for the new hourlong HBO series ``The Sopranos''
sounds simple enough: An upwardly mobile Mafia capo from northern
New Jersey slams head-on into a midlife crisis, enters therapy and
starts taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Funny? Sometimes. Scary? Sure. Human? Very. But simple? No. It's
about as simple as trying to dispose of a fresh corpse in the
Meadowlands after dark when the lip of the construction trash bin
is just too high to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for the notion that life is so complex now that
even a wise guy needs help sorting it out,'' says David Chase, the
creator, writer and co-executive producer of the series. ``Plus,
the mob as we know it has taken some pretty heavy hits from law
enforcement. On a realistic level, who's to say that a man involved
in this wouldn't be feeling tremendous pressure?''
</P>
<P>
   That man is Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), and for 13 weeks,
starting with the show's premiere next Sunday night, the stress of
heading two families, the one he lives with and the one he works
with, is bared to his psychiatrist and the eavesdropping television
audience. The audience sees Tony in all his many guises, including
the inner Tony, a man not fully understood by his wife, his
girlfriend, his passive-aggressive mother or his two teen-age
children.
</P>
<P>
   She is Dr. Jennifer Melfi, a new kind of role for Lorraine
Bracco, one of the movie screen's more famous mob wives. (Ms.
Bracco portrayed Karen Hill, wife of the mobster Henry Hill in
``Goodfellas.'') Having lived through Mafia home life, Ms. Bracco
suddenly finds herself in designer suits and eyeglasses, asking
questions like ``How does that make you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, she said, she thumbed through books with titles
like ``Going Sane,'' ``Sexual Feelings in Psychotherapy,'' ``The
Intimate Hour'' and ``The Drama of the Gifted Child.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony is a gifted child?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he's gifted,'' Ms. Bracco fairly shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' she said. ``How could you not like a man
who is searching to do the right thing? It's `Father Knows Best'
for the millennium. Tony comes to me with these mother issues, a
powerful grown man crying about not knowing what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife and his daughter are at each other's throats and his
mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand in a startling departure from her
famous WASP roles), dispenses guilt with the skill that comes only
from generations of genetic honing.
</P>
<P>
   How can any therapist possibly break through? Tony is a guy. A
big Italian guy. He has big cars and a big white modern suburban
house with a circular drive and a big in-ground pool, plenty of
money (cash, usually) and more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the panic attack, and he ends up on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately I get the feeling that I came in at the end,'' he tells
Dr. Melfi, speaking of his work, his life, the really important
challenges that confronted his father's generation. ``The best is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you depressed?'' Dr. Melfi asks. Tony demurs, then fumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to Gary Cooper, the strong silent type?'' he
says. ``That was an American. He wasn't in touch with his feelings.
He just did what he had to do. See, what they didn't know is that
once they got Gary Cooper in touch with his feelings they couldn't
get him to shut up. It's dysfunction this, dysfunction that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tony's ostensible career as a ``waste management
consultant,'' Dr. Melfi is cautious. As her patient starts to
explain the stress of a recent business transaction _ ``We saw this
guy and there was this issue of an outstanding loan'' _ Dr. Melfi
interrupts to point out that anything discussed in her office is
private, but that if he were to reveal something about, say, a
murder, she would be obliged to go to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened with this fellow,'' Dr. Melfi
starts to say, but then Tony breaks in with a sincere smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he says, pausing. ``We had coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   At which point the camera leaves Tony's face and refocuses on an
office park in Paramus, N.J., where the delinquent debtor, having
spotted Tony, drops his tray of takeout coffee and tries
unsuccessfully to escape Tony's fists and feet. All in a day's
work, which frequently provides evidence of Tony's tough _ even
inventive _ side. At one point, he assaults another wise guy, using
a staple gun to fasten the man's jacket to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Melfi, the brutal Tony is not such a big issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I can only approach it in a way that is best for him
clinically, medically,'' Ms. Bracco said. ``Getting into a
discussion of stapling the guy's suit to him is not going to help
me crack his psyche open to see the good and evil.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bracco originally read not for this quiet, contemplative
part, but for Carmela, Tony's wife, played by Edie Falco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors, we want roles that chew the scenery up,'' Ms. Bracco
said. ``But I was interested in a character no one has given me
before. She's so controlled. She's a blank wall. This is almost
like not speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not just a psychiatrist, she's from the neighborhood,
you know? How many many Italian-American educated women have you
seen on screen?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bracco grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y.; her ``big, powerful
Italian father'' worked at the Fulton Fish Market. As Dr. Melfi,
she reins in the street-corner Brooklyn dialect that is her
customary way of chatting.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the question of Italians and stereotyping, and
whether ``The Sopranos'' is likely to come in for some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the creator, whose family name was originally DeCesare,
and the HBO-Brillstein Grey Entertainment production team see no
problem. Neither do the cast members, almost all of whom are
Italian-Americans from the New York-New Jersey area. Chase grew up
in North Caldwell, N.J., where the Sopranos live, and insisted on
filming the show at locations throughout northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini called the show an ``equal opportunity drama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things lend themselves to drama,'' he said. ``It
didn't bother me at all. I think people are ready for a certain
lack of political correctness. We do things with some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It also appears to be true to mob life in the '90s and the
notion that art imitates life imitating art; that is, today's
gangsters like to model themselves after their screen idols. The
series is peppered with overused epigrams from Hollywood mob
melodramas. In the scene in which Christopher (Michael Imperioli)
and his partner (Vincent Pastore) try to dispose of a body in the
Meadowlands, Christopher intones, ``Louis Brasi sleeps with the
fishes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luca Brasi, Luca, Christopher,'' the partner corrects.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating a big cash haul at Newark International Airport,
another crew member, Paulie (Tony Sirico), invokes Edward G.
Robinson when he exults dramatically but pointlessly, ``Is this the
end of Little Rico?''
</P>
<P>
   And crew members analyzing a recent rub-out ruminate on the
significance of killing someone by shooting him in the eye. Citing
primary source material, they discuss the death of the casino owner
Moe Green in ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny because it's so real,'' said Chris Albrecht,
president of HBO Original Programming. ``These characters are all
completely relatable. The only difference between Tony Soprano and
me is that he's a mob boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Tony Soprano any different from the Wall Street sharks who
live down the block? Perhaps only in that he carries a .45 and they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand him,'' said Gandolfini, who grew up in Park
Ridge, in North Jersey. ``He can be brutal and compassionate. I
think that people who have a lot of compassion also have a lot of
anger. With some people the anger gets stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the compassionate side is often within reach.
</P>
<P>
   In midseries, Tony and his 17-year-old daughter, Meadow, drive
to Maine to visit colleges. Cruising along in the family's
light-gray Lincoln, a pensive Meadow suddenly turns to her father
and asks, ``Are you in the Mafia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I in the what?'' Tony says. ``That's total crap _ who told
you that? That's a stereotype, and it's offensive. I'm in the waste
management business. Everybody immediately assumes you're mobbed
up. There is no Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tony's practiced lying is momentary, and he relents with one
of the few people in the world he loves unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he says, ``some of my money comes from illegal
gambling and whatnot.'' A pause. ``How does that make you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Meadow says wistfully, ``I wish you were like
other dads.'' But she has already inherited the Soprano coyness.
She just needed to hear it from him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at dinner, the conversation continues, and in a single
moment, with his daughter's face shining in the candlelight of a
restaurant, Tony the son, Tony the father and Tony the striver
merge to confront the newly self-absorbed Tony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was in it, my uncle was in it,'' he says. ``There
was a time there when the Italian people didn't have a lot of
options.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he adds, ``being a rebel in my family would have been
selling patio furniture on Route 22.''

PURLOINING STYLE, FAKING CREATIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(bl) 
By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who listens to new music these days will be familiar with
the experience of deja entendu evoked by the works of many
composers favored by our musical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The name in the program may be that of a contemporary; there may
even be a live person sitting in the audience. But the piece turns
out to be shamelessly reminiscent of the style of someone long
dead, and the individual among us _ now perhaps taking a bow
onstage _ is yet another ghostwriter on behalf of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Most often the style evoked will be one formed in the first
third of the century, with Shostakovich and Prokofiev particularly
common models, followed by Bartok and Ravel. Why these? The reason
is not hard to discern. Such composers still sound modern, but not
too modern. They are also not hard to imitate, at least
superficially. If today's pasticheurs were to try to copy, say,
Schubert, they might find the task more troublesome, and their game
would be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The results could also be a lot more interesting. A creative
imagining of what Schubert might have composed had he lived into
old age would be a fascinating project. Perhaps someone could be
persuaded to write his Symphony No. 25 in E flat minor, an hourlong
single movement, ending with an adagio based on a sublime viola
melody. Or there might be the possibility of his opera on ``As You
Like It.''
</P>
<P>
   Other composers could devote themselves to works that once
existed but have been lost, as Alexander Goehr did recently with
Monteverdi's opera ``Arianna.'' Mozart's melodrama ``Semiramis''
awaits its reinventor, as does Bach's ``St. Luke Passion.'' There
are even whole repertories waiting to be brought back to life, like
that of English choral music at the end of the 15th century.
</P>
<P>
   To venture into any of these areas would be to make it clear
that one was creating a deliberate fake _ not that there need be
any opprobrium attached to that activity.
</P>
<P>
   Fakes, if made with sufficient skill and a satisfactory blend of
seriousness and humor, can be excellent things to have around, as
the example of the pseudo-``Arianna'' well shows. And if the
practice of faking needs to be dignified with a classic example,
Berlioz's ``Enfance du Christ'' exists for that purpose. (Now could
be the time, also, to explore historical fakes of a less august
nature, like ``Mozart's 12th Mass,'' once widely sung and widely
loved.)
</P>
<P>
   The many who fake Shostakovich or Ravel, however, do so
covertly. Their aim, they imply, is not to create more Shostakovich
symphonies or Ravel songs but to write their own. Moreover, in a
sleight-of-hand maneuver that projects faking as genuine fresh
creativity, they declare that the language of Shostakovich or Ravel
is the only language available to them in which they can express
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, things do not work that way. Musical languages are not
like English and Spanish: languages that many people can use in
different, personal ways. In the work of a great composer, a single
measure _ often a single chord, sometimes even a single note _ can
be distinctive, as if the very words of the language were being
newly created.
</P>
<P>
   If other composers try to speak with those words, what results
can only be a plagiarism. Shostakovich's language, so poignant when
spoken by him, becomes the mouthing of a ventriloquist's dummy.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of Shostakovich's style must be one reason for its
current appeal to composers, but there is also a more ideological
issue at stake. The works of Shostakovich and other composers of
roughly his generation remind one that tonality did not abruptly
die when Schoenberg, in 1908, began writing atonal music.
</P>
<P>
   By another cunning maneuver, Shostakovich and the rest can be
presented as continuing a line from which Schoenberg broke away.
And we, too, in the 1990s (so the theory goes), can continue the
line by taking it up from them.
</P>
<P>
   History's web, though, is much more tangled. No composer of the
20th century was more acutely, heavily, painfully aware of his
debts and obligations to tradition than Schoenberg. And no composer
was more scarily iconoclastic than Shostakovich. Quite apart from
anything else, to offer Shostakovich as an example of steady
conservatism is to misremember a complex mind and a difficult,
complex career.
</P>
<P>
   If, since his death in 1975, Shostakovich's music has come to
seem more germane to the needs and thinking of composers, it must
be partly because they, too, are having to deal with manifold
pressures and uncertainties _ in a safer political climate, to be
sure _ and partly because, in one of the unpredictable and
incomprehensible sea changes of history, tonality has again become
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   In the current music even of such deeply self-aware radicals as
Milton Babbitt and Pierre Boulez, the 12 notes are no longer equal
(if indeed they ever really were). Neither composer is exactly
writing in C major, but insisted-upon notes or groups of notes have
taken a greater significance in their music.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, John Adams and Gyorgy Ligeti have begun
exploring new scales, as have the great many composers now working
with alternative kinds of tuning.
</P>
<P>
   The world is humming with tonality, and there is no stopping it.
But equally, there is no going back. At least, there is no going
back in the name of musical or expressive truth.

DOW UP FOR 8TH DAY, LONGEST RALLY SINCE NOVEMBER 1996 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose Tuesday for the eighth consecutive
trading day, the longest winning streak in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume accelerated a bit from Monday but remained light.
Still, year-end momentum pushed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index and the Nasdaq composite index to new highs and propelled the
Dow Jones industrial average to within 55 points of breaking its
9,374.27 record, which was set on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the blue-chip Dow index had gained 94.23 points,
or a little more than 1 percent, to 9,320.98. Over the last eight
sessions, the Dow average has risen by 530 points, or 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow last rose for eight straight trading days in November
1996, after President Clinton was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Extending its extraordinary gains this quarter, the S&AMP;P's 500
index rose 16.32 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,241.81. Since the
end of September, the index is up more than 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest record in the Nasdaq composite index came despite a
decline in red-hot Internet stocks. The index closed at 2,181.77,
up 1.47. And the Russell 2000 index of small stocks gained 2.13, to
410.41.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the market
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there is generally an upward bias to prices as we move
to the end of the year, it is quite possible year-end activity is
distorting the significance of eight straight days of rallies,''
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is at least some significance to the fact that the
market is doing well,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you look at the last eight days or at the quarter, the
stock market is sending a fairly clear, strong message: The outlook
for the economy and earnings is upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   According to data released Tuesday by the Investment Company
Institute, a mutual fund trade group, the rally that began in
October seems to have encouraged investors to funnel more money
into stocks. But a spot check of leading mutual fund companies
suggests that the flows have slowed this month. Partly because of
tax reasons, the flow of new money into mutual funds generally
eases in December.
</P>

   A net $13 billion was invested in stock funds in November, the
institute said, up sharply from $2.5 billion in October. Bond funds
attracted $9.14 billion, up from $5.4 billion in October. Flows
into money market mutual funds remained strong, at $34.1 billion.
But that figure represented a decline from the $45.8 billion that
went into such accounts in October.
</P>
<P>
   The institute said that at the end of November, assets under
management at all mutual funds totaled a record $5.37 trillion, up
nearly 20 percent from the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vanguard Group, one of the largest mutual fund companies,
business remains brisk, said John Woerth, a spokesman. So far this
month, Vanguard has taken in about $3.8 billion, half of it
directed into stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the pace at Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab
&AMP; Co. has been slower.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity, sales in equity and bond funds in December have
been ``basically flat,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman. But more
than $1.5 billion has moved into money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a Schwab spokesman, said the company has had net
inflows of just $22.6 million into its funds so far this month,
compared with $657 million for all of December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were helped Tuesday by gains among such major retailers
as Wal-Mart Stores and Gap Inc. on expectations that holiday sales
were stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks rose on optimism that earnings growth in the sector
will outpace those in other large-capitalization industries.
</P>
<P>
   And telephone shares advanced on hopes that they will benefit
from growth in the Internet, since data for the worldwide computer
network is carried over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drug stocks that are included in the Dow, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson rose 3 1/16, to 83|, and Merck gained 3 1/16, to 151 1/16.

CHINA SENTENCES 2 DISSIDENTS, REINFORCING TOUGH STANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials Tuesday reinforced their recent
efforts to silence political opposition, sentencing two New
York-based dissidents who had recently sneaked back into China to
work to promote democratic change to three years in a labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the two men, Zhang Lin and Wei Quanbao, were charged
with hiring prostitutes and evading border police, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said. Both had been denied entry to China. But
the ministry noted that the two are members of a New-York-based
group of dissidents, which it identified as a ``hostile foreign
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were longtime democracy activists. Each had moved to
New York within the last five years and continued campaigning for
democratic change in China.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, the pair planned a return to China in the hope
of working with the fledgling China Democracy Party, said Wang
Bingzhang, another New York-based dissident who is a friend of the
men. The party is a lose association of mainland dissidents that
had been trying to go through legal channels to organize China's
first opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to gain official recognition for the Democracy Party
have come to a crashing halt in the last month as three of the
party's key organizers have been arrested, tried and sentenced to
more than 10 years each in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang and Wei ``went back in the context of rising activity from
the China Democracy Party and other activism, and this encouraged
people to participate each in their own way,'' said Xiao Qiang,
executive director of Human Rights in China, from New York. ``And
of course, their arrests show the Chinese security apparatus keeps
very close eyes on these people.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested Nov. 12 in a barber shop that authorities
said was a brothel, just days after entering China illegally in the
back of a truck. It is not clear if they were able to contact any
members of the party, a number of whom they knew at least casually
from their involvement in pro-democracy protests centered in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew there was danger involved in their trips and they
were mentally prepared for a sentence,'' said Wang. He, like the
two men sentenced today, has been associated with a group called
the China Democracy and Justice Party, a New York-based group that
has no official relation to the China Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Wang sneaked into China, also trying to promote the
development of democracy and was also detained by authorities. He
was quickly ejected. Zhang and Wei were dealt harsher treatment,
probably in part because they still hold Chinese passports. Both
were granted political asylum and have legal residence in the
United States, although Zhang, who arrived last year, does not yet
have a green card.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the government's harsh treatment of
activists in the past month represents a true hardening of official
attitude or is merely a reaction to a dissident community that has
become increasingly outspoken and organized this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some China experts have suggested that the Communists are trying
to get their house in order and their dissidents under control in
preparation for 1999, a momentous and potentially explosive year.
The 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China will be in October. And the 10th anniversary of the military
suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations will be in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for General Winter, and the stillness that for a few
frozen months, at least, was supposed to lie across the tormented
land of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, when Christians fight Muslims across the
snowy hillsides of the southern Balkans, not even Christmas can
halt the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   British and German troops may once have respected a truce of
sorts in the trenches of Flanders, but in 1998, when Serbs and
ethnic Albanians are in the field, Christmas Eve is when
cease-fires collapse. And not only cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important casualty of the violent Christmas
weekend is the old notion of how this dirty war might be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed until now, over the past few weeks, its contours have
subtly shifted. Previously there was no argument about the villain
of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   This was Slobodan Milosevic's war. He had started it back in
1989 (and with it the entire Balkan tragedy that would follow) by
scrapping the autonomy Kosovo and its overwhelming Albanian
majority had previously enjoyed, and even now, he retains the prime
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   His savage, utterly disproportionate crackdown on the ethnic
Albanians last spring set the stage for a summer of fighting which
would make refugees of a quarter of a million people, pit Russia
against the West and ultimately have B-52s waiting, engines
revving, on British airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the October cease-fire agreement, providing for
Serbian withdrawal, the start of political negotiations, and the
dispatch of 2,000 unarmed international observers to make sure
everyone kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   This time however, no matter how much you detest the regime in
Belgrade, matters are not so simple. The Kosovo Liberation Army is
at least as much to blame for the collapse of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Serbs are overreacting: is a column of tanks
really required to avenge the death of a single policeman? But the
KLA, too, is spoiling for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It has acquired new arms, above all anti-tank weapons to nullify
the most potent asset of the Serb forces, and shows absolutely no
interest in the political talks which are supposed to start next
month. Bomb Milosevic, says the heart. But this time the head
resists.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, and despite every vow made by Western foreign
ministers at meetings without number, Kosovo looks more like Bosnia
with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   The killing, admittedly, is nowhere near on the same scale. But
even before half of them have even taken up their stations, the
OSCE monitors are acquiring an uncanny resemblance to the unhappy
men of UNPROFOR earlier in the decade, the Bosnian ``peacekeepers''
with no peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday OSCE teams were sent to the village of Obranca, focal
point of the latest fighting. How long, one wonders, before some of
their number are taken hostage, or killed in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? Conceivably, of course, this being the season of
hope, good will, and irrational optimism, events might yet get us
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, after a decade of slaughter and barbarity, 1999 will
prove to be the final year of this most terrible of the 20th
century's Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year will at last see the demise of the Milosevic
regime, brought down peaceably from within by the economic misery
and international obloquy it has inflicted upon the Serbian nation.
Maybe its successor will be more sensible and less nationalist,
open to a reasonable accommodation with the Kosovan Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too, sweet reason will also descend on the shoulders of
these latter, despite the atrocities and humiliations heaped upon
them by Belgrade. And then again, 1999 may be when Saddam Hussein
makes a state visit to Washington. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In practical terms, the West faces the dilemma of dealing with a
conflict in which the middle ground of political negotiation,
freely entered into by both parties, is now scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, we cannot let the two sides simply fight it out. In the
short term, this would probably lead to another cycle of Serbian
repression, horrific media pictures and public clamor forcing
Western governments to intervene in much haste, but to little
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if crackdown is unacceptable, so too _ at least for now _ is
an independent Kosovo, which the Western chancelleries argue might
tear Macedonia apart. For even autocrats cannot ignore the body bag
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, the cost of enforcing control could prove too
high even for the Serbs, and the Albanians who outnumber them nine
to one in Kosovo would have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the spectre of an inchoate ``Greater Albania,'' which would
further destabilize an already unstable region and perhaps drag
Greece, Bulgaria and, worst of all, Turkey, into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, I have reluctantly come to believe, mono-ethnic
states of this kind are the only bricks with which to build the new
Balkans. Right now, however, there is barely a smaller Albania, let
alone a greater one.
</P>
<P>
   But this violent Christmas has at least one merit: it has laid
bare the harsh and central truth about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is adjudged the best solution _ whether to defy Balkan
logic and attempt to maintain an ethnically-mixed Kosovo somehow
linked to Serbia, or to lay the ground for a new Albanian political
entity in the southern Balkans _ only a credible Western military
presence will allow it to be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not talking about unarmed observers, monitors or
``verifiers,'' but ground troops with all the hardware they need,
in Kosovo for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, in short, will have to become another Bosnia. Not, we
must ensure, in the sense of the brutality and slaughter which
preceded the settlement imposed by the Americans at Dayton, but in
becoming a de facto Western protectorate as Bosnia now is,
installed under the guise of another Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, the instigators of this accord would be
European statesmen, and the troops who make it stick should be
European troops. But Kosovo has come too soon for Europe, whatever
the agreement on a future European defense identity between Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover will have to be NATO, in other words the
Americans. The United States will not like it, no more than it
liked the prospect of its ground troops committed to Bosnia _ and
perhaps even less, for in Bosnia a presence which was originally
meant to last six months has now become open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. and its allies to meet some predetermined
artificial deadline to withdraw, Washington knows full well, would
simply invite disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And so in Kosovo too. But a permanent military presence there
would almost certainly prove as effective as it has in Bosnia, with
remarkably little loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee the essentials: the Kosovo Albanians would be
freed from the threat of Serbian oppression and violence; the Serbs
would be assured of access to their holy sites, political and
religious.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it would buy time, to wait out Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for General Winter, and the stillness that for a few
frozen months, at least, was supposed to lie across the tormented
land of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, when Christians fight Muslims across the
snowy hillsides of the southern Balkans, not even Christmas can
halt the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   British and German troops may once have respected a truce of
sorts in the trenches of Flanders, but in 1998, when Serbs and
ethnic Albanians are in the field, Christmas Eve is when
cease-fires collapse. And not only cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important casualty of the violent Christmas
weekend is the old notion of how this dirty war might be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed until now, over the past few weeks, its contours have
subtly shifted. Previously there was no argument about the villain
of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   This was Slobodan Milosevic's war. He had started it back in
1989 (and with it the entire Balkan tragedy that would follow) by
scrapping the autonomy Kosovo and its overwhelming Albanian
majority had previously enjoyed, and even now, he retains the prime
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   His savage, utterly disproportionate crackdown on the ethnic
Albanians last spring set the stage for a summer of fighting which
would make refugees of a quarter of a million people, pit Russia
against the West and ultimately have B-52s waiting, engines
revving, on British airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the October cease-fire agreement, providing for
Serbian withdrawal, the start of political negotiations, and the
dispatch of 2,000 unarmed international observers to make sure
everyone kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   This time however, no matter how much you detest the regime in
Belgrade, matters are not so simple. The Kosovo Liberation Army is
at least as much to blame for the collapse of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Serbs are overreacting: is a column of tanks
really required to avenge the death of a single policeman? But the
KLA, too, is spoiling for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It has acquired new arms, above all anti-tank weapons to nullify
the most potent asset of the Serb forces, and shows absolutely no
interest in the political talks which are supposed to start next
month. Bomb Milosevic, says the heart. But this time the head
resists.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, and despite every vow made by Western foreign
ministers at meetings without number, Kosovo looks more like Bosnia
with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   The killing, admittedly, is nowhere near on the same scale. But
even before half of them have even taken up their stations, the
OSCE monitors are acquiring an uncanny resemblance to the unhappy
men of UNPROFOR earlier in the decade, the Bosnian ``peacekeepers''
with no peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday OSCE teams were sent to the village of Obranca, focal
point of the latest fighting. How long, one wonders, before some of
their number are taken hostage, or killed in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? Conceivably, of course, this being the season of
hope, good will, and irrational optimism, events might yet get us
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, after a decade of slaughter and barbarity, 1999 will
prove to be the final year of this most terrible of the 20th
century's Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year will at last see the demise of the Milosevic
regime, brought down peaceably from within by the economic misery
and international obloquy it has inflicted upon the Serbian nation.
Maybe its successor will be more sensible and less nationalist,
open to a reasonable accommodation with the Kosovan Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too, sweet reason will also descend on the shoulders of
these latter, despite the atrocities and humiliations heaped upon
them by Belgrade. And then again, 1999 may be when Saddam Hussein
makes a state visit to Washington. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In practical terms, the West faces the dilemma of dealing with a
conflict in which the middle ground of political negotiation,
freely entered into by both parties, is now scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, we cannot let the two sides simply fight it out. In the
short term, this would probably lead to another cycle of Serbian
repression, horrific media pictures and public clamor forcing
Western governments to intervene in much haste, but to little
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if crackdown is unacceptable, so too _ at least for now _ is
an independent Kosovo, which the Western chancelleries argue might
tear Macedonia apart. For even autocrats cannot ignore the body bag
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, the cost of enforcing control could prove too
high even for the Serbs, and the Albanians who outnumber them nine
to one in Kosovo would have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the spectre of an inchoate ``Greater Albania,'' which would
further destabilize an already unstable region and perhaps drag
Greece, Bulgaria and, worst of all, Turkey, into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, I have reluctantly come to believe, mono-ethnic
states of this kind are the only bricks with which to build the new
Balkans. Right now, however, there is barely a smaller Albania, let
alone a greater one.
</P>
<P>
   But this violent Christmas has at least one merit: it has laid
bare the harsh and central truth about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is adjudged the best solution _ whether to defy Balkan
logic and attempt to maintain an ethnically-mixed Kosovo somehow
linked to Serbia, or to lay the ground for a new Albanian political
entity in the southern Balkans _ only a credible Western military
presence will allow it to be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not talking about unarmed observers, monitors or
``verifiers,'' but ground troops with all the hardware they need,
in Kosovo for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, in short, will have to become another Bosnia. Not, we
must ensure, in the sense of the brutality and slaughter which
preceded the settlement imposed by the Americans at Dayton, but in
becoming a de facto Western protectorate as Bosnia now is,
installed under the guise of another Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, the instigators of this accord would be
European statesmen, and the troops who make it stick should be
European troops. But Kosovo has come too soon for Europe, whatever
the agreement on a future European defense identity between Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover will have to be NATO, in other words the
Americans. The United States will not like it, no more than it
liked the prospect of its ground troops committed to Bosnia _ and
perhaps even less, for in Bosnia a presence which was originally
meant to last six months has now become open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. and its allies to meet some predetermined
artificial deadline to withdraw, Washington knows full well, would
simply invite disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And so in Kosovo too. But a permanent military presence there
would almost certainly prove as effective as it has in Bosnia, with
remarkably little loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee the essentials: the Kosovo Albanians would be
freed from the threat of Serbian oppression and violence; the Serbs
would be assured of access to their holy sites, political and
religious.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it would buy time, to wait out Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the week when Europe starts its gigantic experiment, the
launch of a single currency for 11 members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   It will soon be possible, for the first time since the fall of
the Roman Empire, to travel from the Channel to the tip of Italy
without having to change money.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork quilt of currencies that Europeans have used in
their daily lives for more than 1,500 years is being replaced with
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   The euro becomes a legal entity on Jan. 1, 1999. It will swiftly
replace the national currencies and, within three years francs,
marks, pesetas, lire and so on will have become history.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experiment in the sense that there is no precedent for
such an event. There have been currency reforms, of course, where a
country has decided to replace an old currency with a new one:
Germany has done so three times this century.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes countries have chosen to link their money to that of a
foreign power _ many to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts by countries to bind their currencies
together: there was an attempt at a European currency in the last
century, which failed.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been occasions when a country has had its own
money replaced with a foreign one, usually as a result of conquest,
colonization or some other political shock.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, the first time that a group of countries which
are not part of a political union and which have not been conquered
or colonized have agreed to give up their own currencies for
another.
</P>
<P>
   So anything said or written about the launch of the euro, and in
particular its political and economic consequences, has to be taken
with a pinch of salt. We have to guess; we cannot know. This is a
journey without maps.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is make a stab at gauging some of the effects of
this decision. There is one clear political consequence, and a
number of less clear economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the political impact of the new European Central
Bank, the body that will ``run'' the euro. Up to now, the European
political institutions have been quite weak. The key decisions
supposedly imposed by the Brussels bureaucracy have almost
invariably been approved by national governments; power still lies
with the ministers of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
   As for the importance of the European Parliament _ well, a quick
test: can you name a Euro MP? Now there is a new institution for
Europe. All national countries have some sort of central bank to
run their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trend has been to make that central bank more
independent of the government, to give it more power. But central
banks operate within the framework of a national government: the
Bank if England has its independence because that has been given to
it by a powerful parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Central Bank in Frankfurt has been given its
independence too, but the counterweight of the European Parliament
is much weaker.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, having a new independent body running the euro
compensates for the weakness of other European institutions. In
another sense, Europe has created a new focus of power, sharply
reducing the scope for national parliaments to exert their own
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Europe is not just getting a single currency. It
is getting a single interest rate, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least is the theory. If you ask practical questions as
to how the European Central Bank will exert its power, the answers
are guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Will European interest rates be high or low? Will the currency
be strong or weak? Will the bank pay more attention to the needs of
the countries on the fringe or will the big battalions dominate?
</P>
<P>
   If we do not know what sort of currency the euro is going to be,
judging its economic effects is obviously hazardous. But some
things can sensibly be said. For a start, giving Europe a single
currency will give a spur to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that prices are fixed in the same unit will mean that
they will tend to converge. Buy a new car in Inverness and it will
be pretty much the same price as one in Truro; buy a car in
Copenhagen and the price will be very different from one in
Seville. Expect those differences to narrow swiftly _ and expect
the prices to narrow down, not narrow up.
</P>
<P>
   That will have an enormous impact on companies. Those with
plants in different countries, with different wage rates and
productivity levels, will immediately be able to compare those
differences. They will be forced to improve efficiency and Europe's
economy will become more competitive as a result.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other effects. We are already seeing the impetus
for cross-European mergers; expect that to proceed apace. We are
already seeing the impetus for a cross-European tax policy; the
single currency will inevitably encourage that process, not because
some politicians and officials are determined to impose common
taxes, but because the scale of the differentials will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for companies to pay similar taxes across Europe
will grow, for if large differentials remain, they will relocate
towards the lower tax zones.
</P>
<P>
   So the European economy will become more integrated and more
efficient. Some parts will benefit; others will find the new burst
of competition very tough.
</P>
<P>
   The single interest rate will be a particularly powerful
discipline. It is not just that some parts will have to operate on
interest rates that are too high for their local needs, others that
are too low. It is also that finance will tend to flow towards
areas and projects that deliver the highest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will think pan-European, rather than in little
national boxes. The leaders will bound forward, the laggards will
suffer still more.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that investors have a new common zone in which to
operate will have one further impact _ one that will, if the euro
is successful, change Europe's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Second World War there has been a single global
currency standard, the dollar. It has been challenged at times by
the yen and the German mark, and in the early postwar years
sterling was bracketed alongside.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar has really dominated. No longer. The euro will be
close in value to the U.S. dollar, backed by an economy of similar
size. The world's currencies will have two anchors, not one.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be a source of tension or will they coexist happily?
Will people trust the euro?
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the greatest question of all. Will the euro
succeed?
</P>
<P>
   History is littered with attempts at currency unions that have
failed. I suppose the failure of the sterling area, made up of many
members of the former British Empire, is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been no lasting currency union without a
political union. So what Europe is attempting is a great daring,
romantic leap into the unknown. &QL;

HOUSE PROSECUTORS ANNOUNCE PLANS TO CALL WITNESSES IN CLINTON
TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors announced plans Tuesday to call
witnesses _ perhaps even former presidential paramour Monica
Lewinsky _ when President Clinton's impeachment trial gets under
way in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But that strategy conflicts with the position of Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that a trial could be based solely on
the record of sworn testimony compiled by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lott and several other Republicans, including
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, cautioned lawmakers against rushing toward a
censure deal with the White House before a Senate trial begins and
the charges against Clinton are fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   Impeached by the House on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges stemming from his effort to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky, Clinton is only the second president in U.S. history to
face trial and possible removal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging Tuesday afternoon from a closed-door strategy session,
several of the House members appointed to present the case against
Clinton to the Senate said they had agreed to summon witnesses and
not rely solely on grand jury evidence once the trial starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no show of hands. But I am anticipating, based on
everything we've discussed in there today, that there would be
witnesses, we would present witnesses. I don't think there's any
question about that,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lewinsky might be called, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.,
said: ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other key figures, including Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded
her telephone calls with Lewinsky, Clinton confidante Vernon
Jordan, the president's personal secretary, Betty Currie, and other
key White House figures could be questioned in public.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said a trial _ much like the House impeachment hearings
and debate _ could be held without bringing witnesses to the floor
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are witnesses required? I don't think so,'' Lott told The
Associated Press. ``I think the record is there to be reviewed,
read, presented in a form that (House prosecutors) choose ... and I
think that would be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott also proposed to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., that Clinton's trial begin Jan. 7 with Chief Justice
William Rehnquist swearing senators in as jurors. The GOP leader
suggested Jan. 11 as the date for the Senate to begin hearing
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   No firm decisions were made about a timetable for beginning the
trial, the first since President Andrew Johnson was acquitted by
the Senate in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's meeting, the 13-person, all-Republican team of
case managers was told by Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief House
prosecutor, to prepare for a full-fledged trial even though it
could be abruptly halted by a censure deal. The group plans to meet
again next week after the Senate convenes and provides guidance on
how it wants to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Senate Republican, several Senate Democrats and
White House allies have publicly advocated reaching an agreement
that would avoid a prolonged trial and result in a formal censure
or rebuke of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Gramm said senators should vote on whether Clinton
should be removed before formally considering any censure proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm urged lawmakers to ignore ``rising calls for the Senate to
short-circuit the constitutional process'' of beginning Clinton's
trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the Senate has a clear, constitutional
obligation to vote on whether the president is guilty or not guilty
of the two articles of impeachment adopted by the House,'' Gramm
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the lone Republican voice in the Senate calling for
censure of Clinton is Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah conservative who
sees it as ``the only option left'' since impeachment advocates are
expected to fall short of the two-thirds vote needed to convict the
president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm disagreed. ``I strongly believe that the Senate's
commitment must be to a fair, constitutional process and not to any
given outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said a case
for censure can still be made now that influential senators have
come out in favor of the measure instead of removing the president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jackson Lee told reporters that when the new
Congress convenes next week and the House votes to reappoint Hyde
and his team of prosecutors, Democrats should be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the momentum to present a case for censure,'' said
Jackson Lee, one of four House Judiciary Committee members who
drafted a censure resolution that was rejected in committee and on
the House floor. ``I'm saying let us address the question openly
about a censure resolution. We have the right as Democrats to have
managers.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Jackson Lee said she would be willing
to participate as one of the case managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they would hear from those who have argued for
censure,'' she said. ``It (censure) is not a deal. It is not a
cover up. It is an appropriate reprimand. It is harsh.''

   As for the importance of the European Parliament _ well, a quick
test: can you name a Euro MP? Now there is a new institution for
Europe. All national countries have some sort of central bank to
run their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trend has been to make that central bank more
independent of the government, to give it more power. But central
banks operate within the framework of a national government: the
Bank if England has its independence because that has been given to
it by a powerful parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Central Bank in Frankfurt has been given its
independence too, but the counterweight of the European Parliament
is much weaker.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, having a new independent body running the euro
compensates for the weakness of other European institutions. In
another sense, Europe has created a new focus of power, sharply
reducing the scope for national parliaments to exert their own
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Europe is not just getting a single currency. It
is getting a single interest rate, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least is the theory. If you ask practical questions as
to how the European Central Bank will exert its power, the answers
are guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Will European interest rates be high or low? Will the currency
be strong or weak? Will the bank pay more attention to the needs of
the countries on the fringe or will the big battalions dominate?
</P>
<P>
   If we do not know what sort of currency the euro is going to be,
judging its economic effects is obviously hazardous. But some
things can sensibly be said. For a start, giving Europe a single
currency will give a spur to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that prices are fixed in the same unit will mean that
they will tend to converge. Buy a new car in Inverness and it will
be pretty much the same price as one in Truro; buy a car in
Copenhagen and the price will be very different from one in
Seville. Expect those differences to narrow swiftly _ and expect
the prices to narrow down, not narrow up.
</P>
<P>
   That will have an enormous impact on companies. Those with
plants in different countries, with different wage rates and
productivity levels, will immediately be able to compare those
differences. They will be forced to improve efficiency and Europe's
economy will become more competitive as a result.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other effects. We are already seeing the impetus
for cross-European mergers; expect that to proceed apace. We are
already seeing the impetus for a cross-European tax policy; the
single currency will inevitably encourage that process, not because
some politicians and officials are determined to impose common
taxes, but because the scale of the differentials will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for companies to pay similar taxes across Europe
will grow, for if large differentials remain, they will relocate
towards the lower tax zones.
</P>
<P>
   So the European economy will become more integrated and more
efficient. Some parts will benefit; others will find the new burst
of competition very tough.
</P>
<P>
   The single interest rate will be a particularly powerful
discipline. It is not just that some parts will have to operate on
interest rates that are too high for their local needs, others that
are too low. It is also that finance will tend to flow towards
areas and projects that deliver the highest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will think pan-European, rather than in little
national boxes. The leaders will bound forward, the laggards will
suffer still more.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that investors have a new common zone in which to
operate will have one further impact _ one that will, if the euro
is successful, change Europe's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Second World War there has been a single global
currency standard, the dollar. It has been challenged at times by
the yen and the German mark, and in the early postwar years
sterling was bracketed alongside.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar has really dominated. No longer. The euro will be
close in value to the U.S. dollar, backed by an economy of similar
size. The world's currencies will have two anchors, not one.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be a source of tension or will they coexist happily?
Will people trust the euro?
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the greatest question of all. Will the euro
succeed?
</P>
<P>
   History is littered with attempts at currency unions that have
failed. I suppose the failure of the sterling area, made up of many
members of the former British Empire, is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been no lasting currency union without a
political union. So what Europe is attempting is a great daring,
romantic leap into the unknown. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the week when Europe starts its gigantic experiment, the
launch of a single currency for 11 members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   It will soon be possible, for the first time since the fall of
the Roman Empire, to travel from the Channel to the tip of Italy
without having to change money.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork quilt of currencies that Europeans have used in
their daily lives for more than 1,500 years is being replaced with
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   The euro becomes a legal entity on Jan. 1, 1999. It will swiftly
replace the national currencies and, within three years francs,
marks, pesetas, lire and so on will have become history.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experiment in the sense that there is no precedent for
such an event. There have been currency reforms, of course, where a
country has decided to replace an old currency with a new one:
Germany has done so three times this century.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes countries have chosen to link their money to that of a
foreign power _ many to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts by countries to bind their currencies
together: there was an attempt at a European currency in the last
century, which failed.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been occasions when a country has had its own
money replaced with a foreign one, usually as a result of conquest,
colonization or some other political shock.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, the first time that a group of countries which
are not part of a political union and which have not been conquered
or colonized have agreed to give up their own currencies for
another.
</P>
<P>
   So anything said or written about the launch of the euro, and in
particular its political and economic consequences, has to be taken
with a pinch of salt. We have to guess; we cannot know. This is a
journey without maps.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is make a stab at gauging some of the effects of
this decision. There is one clear political consequence, and a
number of less clear economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the political impact of the new European Central
Bank, the body that will ``run'' the euro. Up to now, the European
political institutions have been quite weak. The key decisions
supposedly imposed by the Brussels bureaucracy have almost
invariably been approved by national governments; power still lies
with the ministers of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
   As for the importance of the European Parliament _ well, a quick
test: can you name a Euro MP? Now there is a new institution for
Europe. All national countries have some sort of central bank to
run their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trend has been to make that central bank more
independent of the government, to give it more power. But central
banks operate within the framework of a national government: the
Bank if England has its independence because that has been given to
it by a powerful parliament.

is much weaker.

   In one sense, having a new independent body running the euro
compensates for the weakness of other European institutions. In
another sense, Europe has created a new focus of power, sharply
reducing the scope for national parliaments to exert their own
authority.

is getting a single interest rate, too.

   That, at least is the theory. If you ask practical questions as

be strong or weak? Will the bank pay more attention to the needs of
the countries on the fringe or will the big battalions dominate?

L.A. TIMES TO LAY OFF NEARLY 100 IN THIRD ROUND OF CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (Also moving in the ``n'' California and ``a'' national news
files) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about slowing growth in advertising revenues, the Los
Angeles Times said it will eliminate nearly 100 distribution jobs
and end contracts with 50 or more free-lance delivery agents as
part of a third and apparent final round of job cuts this holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ten full-time and 84-part-time jobs in the single-copy and
home-delivery distribution operations will be eliminated. Most will
be layoffs, but some are voluntary retirements, the paper announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The flagship newspaper of Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Co.
also will stop doing business with 50 of the 150 independent
newspaper delivery agencies that deliver the paper to subscribers
in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.
</P>
<P>
   While workers in those agencies are not Times Mirror employees,
typically the bulk of a delivery agency's revenue comes from one
newspaper. A Times spokeswoman couldn't say how many people would
be affected by the decision to stop working with the 50 agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks are being done to streamline home-delivery
operations and reduce distribution costs, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times first announced in November that it would begin a
series of layoffs in the last weeks of the year in response to poor
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the company has identified a total of 850 jobs _ 13
percent of the paper's work force _ to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs began in November and will continue into the first
quarter of 1999. Most of the jobs cut were in business operations,
not the news department. Half were part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no plans for further cutbacks in 1999, ``it's
not wise to say there won't be anything,'' said Times spokeswoman
Laura Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue growth at the Times has been lagging behind
the industry average, said Peter Appert, an analyst for BT Alex.
Brown in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a slowing economic engine nationally, industry ad
growth has been weakening this year, from an increase of 6.6
percent in the first quarter to 5 percent in the third quarter and
an expected 4 percent increase for the fourth quarter, Appert said.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror said earlier it would take a $225 million charge
against earnings this year for the restructuring at the Times and
at its other papers. Tuesday's cuts were announced after the stock
market closed.

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The owner of my favorite bar in Paris is not a
philosophical sort of man. He rarely says anything at all. The
other day he came to my table and gave a long soliloquy about the
euro (a subject dear to his heart, and pocket, since he replaced
his till and portable bankers' card machines to prepare for the
partial launch of the new currency next month).
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the soliloquy was not negative. Nor was it
especially positive. He was convinced, in a matter-of-fact kind of
way, that the coming of the euro was the ``real beginning of Europe
as one country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did any of it mean, there, in Brussels, until now?
Nothing. But money, that people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that in 50 years' time, everyone in Europe would
have two nationalities and two languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I feel Breton and French. In the future, they will feel
French or Italian or German, and at the same time, they will feel
European. Everyone will talk their own language and also English.
Except you, the English. You will always talk only English.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is right, and the Daily Telegraph is right, and the French
Euroskeptics like the former interior minister, Charles Pasqua, are
right, this week marks the beginning of the end of the nation state
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Where _ apart from in Britain _ are the forces of national
resistance? Where are the violent street demonstrations? Where are
the new European civil wars, predicted in a book serialized in The
Times a couple of years ago? Where are the legions of currency
speculators, determined to bring the whole cumbersome apparatus
down?
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the euro is the story of a whole pack of dogs
which did not bark. The recession, and uprisings, predicted as a
result of the spending cuts forced by the euro guidelines have not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the Euroland countries, with record low
interest rates and low inflation, are resisting the turbulence in
the world economy better than most.
</P>
<P>
   The visceral opposition of the German public has evaporated. The
French public _ like the other nine euro publics _ is apathetically
enthusiastic: hugely in favor, according to the polls, but not
especially interested.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year gap between the political launch of the single
currency this week and the appearance of alien, monopoly money in
people's pockets looked like a huge hostage to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out to have been a political masterstroke: lulling
the Europeans into a gradual acceptance of the euro, like someone
drowsing in the bath with the hot tap turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone fundamentally pro-European, it is bizarre, even
disturbing experience, to see a proud and great country like France
sleep-walking into something so elemental to its future.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, the husk of the franc will remain in French
pockets, but the franc, as an independent, national currency, as an
instrument of national economic policy, as a symbol or tool of
national sovereignty, will have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of the franc against the euro and the 10 other euro
currencies will be fixed in concrete. Decisions on interest rates
and money supply will be taken by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, under the chairmanship of a Dutch banker who looks like
one of the many incarnations of Dr. Who.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 1, 2002, the euro will have a strange life as a
virtual currency, a plastic currency, an electronic currency. There
will be euro checkbooks (smaller than existing ones to set them
apart). There will be euro-compatible bankers' cards. But there
will be no foldable euro notes or spinnable euro coins.
</P>
<P>
   Big business in Euroland is expected to switch to making paper
and electronic transactions in Euros immediately. For the next
three years, small businesses, restaurants and shops have the
option of accepting Euros in plastic or check form _ or not, as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from street level, the whole business looks like a bit of a
non-event. But the Paris bar owner, Charles Pasqua and the Daily
Telegraph are right.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the single currency is a quantum leap in the
creation of a common European identity and a single European
political and economic entity (even if the f-word, federalism, is
banned now in France and Germany as much as in Britain).
</P>
<P>
   It is a quantum leap partly for the reasons the bar owner gave.
Once the euro becomes a real currency in three years' time, Europe
will become part of daily life, something palpable and meaningful
to ordinary, non-farming Europeans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This could, ultimately, help to create the kind of political and
democratic legitimacy which the European Union _ always a top-down,
elitist kind of notion _ has never really had. Small wonder that
the Euroskeptics loathe the idea of the euro as they do.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge dangers also, from the pro-European
perspective. If the European economies falter or crash before the
euro becomes fully accepted, the single currency and the European
Central Bank will be easy and obvious demagogic targets.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency is a quantum leap for other reasons, which
pro-Europeans prefer to smooth over.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why many Britons have never emotionally
accepted the EEC/EC/EU is that it was sold to them as a simple
common market, which it never really was.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Blair government, under withering Euroskeptic
fire, tends now to minimize the significance _ in terms of
sovereignty, in terms of loss of economic control _ of joining the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the existence of a single currency is likely to force
the Euroland governments, little by little, to take many more
economic and political decisions together.
</P>
<P>
   Scope will remain for independent policies on taxation (as even
the individual U.S. states or Canadian provinces have). But the
otherwise destabilizing effect of differing national economies will
force the Euroland governments to coordinate economic policy more
and more closely.
</P>
<P>
   To this extent, the decision of the new German government to
drop the Kohl-fired opposition to such a notion is not so much a
swing to the left as a recognition of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, the case for more direct democracy at
European level _ also inevitably a federalizing force _ would
become unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the EU has been one of setting seemingly purely
economic targets _ the common market, the single market, the single
currency _ which turn out to be deeply political targets.
</P>
<P>
   Removing economic barriers forces the removal of political
barriers (something Baroness Thatcher failed to grasp). The coming
of the euro sets that clock ticking again, more powerfully than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. There are good economic arguments for the Euro. There is a
case for more political unity in Europe, short _ far short _ of the
arrogant, bureaucratic, federal superstate of Euroskeptic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer you come to real lives of real people, as the
euro does, the more you need to be sure that the real people accept
what is happening in their name and why.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference with which the phantom phase of the euro will
be greeted throughout Euroland next week may baffle Euroskeptics;
it should also unsettle the pro-Europeans. &QL;

also will stop doing business with 50 of the 150 independent
newspaper delivery agencies that deliver the paper to subscribers
in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.
</P>
<P>
   While workers in those agencies are not Times Mirror employees,
typically the bulk of a delivery agency's revenue comes from one
newspaper. A Times spokeswoman couldn't say how many people would
be affected by the decision to stop working with the 50 agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks are being done to streamline home-delivery
operations and reduce distribution costs, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times first announced in November that it would begin a
series of layoffs in the last weeks of the year in response to poor
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the company has identified a total of 850 jobs _ 13
percent of the paper's work force _ to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs began in November and will continue into the first
quarter of 1999. Most of the jobs cut were in business operations,
not the news department. Half were part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no plans for further cutbacks in 1999, ``it's
not wise to say there won't be anything,'' said Times spokeswoman
Laura Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue growth at the Times has been lagging behind
the industry average, said Peter Appert, an analyst for BT Alex.
Brown in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a slowing economic engine nationally, industry ad
growth has been weakening this year, from an increase of 6.6
percent in the first quarter to 5 percent in the third quarter and
an expected 4 percent increase for the fourth quarter, Appert said.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror said earlier it would take a $225 million charge
against earnings this year for the restructuring at the Times and
at its other papers. Tuesday's cuts were announced after the stock
market closed.

<P>
   PARIS _ The owner of my favorite bar in Paris is not a
philosophical sort of man. He rarely says anything at all. The
other day he came to my table and gave a long soliloquy about the
euro (a subject dear to his heart, and pocket, since he replaced
his till and portable bankers' card machines to prepare for the
partial launch of the new currency next month).
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the soliloquy was not negative. Nor was it
especially positive. He was convinced, in a matter-of-fact kind of
way, that the coming of the euro was the ``real beginning of Europe
as one country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did any of it mean, there, in Brussels, until now?
Nothing. But money, that people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that in 50 years' time, everyone in Europe would
have two nationalities and two languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I feel Breton and French. In the future, they will feel
French or Italian or German, and at the same time, they will feel
European. Everyone will talk their own language and also English.
Except you, the English. You will always talk only English.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is right, and the Daily Telegraph is right, and the French
Euroskeptics like the former interior minister, Charles Pasqua, are
right, this week marks the beginning of the end of the nation state
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Where _ apart from in Britain _ are the forces of national
resistance? Where are the violent street demonstrations? Where are
the new European civil wars, predicted in a book serialized in The
Times a couple of years ago? Where are the legions of currency
speculators, determined to bring the whole cumbersome apparatus
down?
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the euro is the story of a whole pack of dogs
which did not bark. The recession, and uprisings, predicted as a
result of the spending cuts forced by the euro guidelines have not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the Euroland countries, with record low
interest rates and low inflation, are resisting the turbulence in
the world economy better than most.
</P>
<P>
   The visceral opposition of the German public has evaporated. The
French public _ like the other nine euro publics _ is apathetically
enthusiastic: hugely in favor, according to the polls, but not
especially interested.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year gap between the political launch of the single
currency this week and the appearance of alien, monopoly money in
people's pockets looked like a huge hostage to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out to have been a political masterstroke: lulling
the Europeans into a gradual acceptance of the euro, like someone
drowsing in the bath with the hot tap turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone fundamentally pro-European, it is bizarre, even
disturbing experience, to see a proud and great country like France
sleep-walking into something so elemental to its future.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, the husk of the franc will remain in French
pockets, but the franc, as an independent, national currency, as an
instrument of national economic policy, as a symbol or tool of
national sovereignty, will have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of the franc against the euro and the 10 other euro
currencies will be fixed in concrete. Decisions on interest rates
and money supply will be taken by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, under the chairmanship of a Dutch banker who looks like
one of the many incarnations of Dr. Who.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 1, 2002, the euro will have a strange life as a
virtual currency, a plastic currency, an electronic currency. There
will be euro checkbooks (smaller than existing ones to set them
apart). There will be euro-compatible bankers' cards. But there
will be no foldable euro notes or spinnable euro coins.
</P>
<P>
   Big business in Euroland is expected to switch to making paper
and electronic transactions in Euros immediately. For the next
three years, small businesses, restaurants and shops have the
option of accepting Euros in plastic or check form _ or not, as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from street level, the whole business looks like a bit of a
non-event. But the Paris bar owner, Charles Pasqua and the Daily
Telegraph are right.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the single currency is a quantum leap in the
creation of a common European identity and a single European
political and economic entity (even if the f-word, federalism, is
banned now in France and Germany as much as in Britain).
</P>
<P>
   It is a quantum leap partly for the reasons the bar owner gave.
Once the euro becomes a real currency in three years' time, Europe
will become part of daily life, something palpable and meaningful
to ordinary, non-farming Europeans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This could, ultimately, help to create the kind of political and
democratic legitimacy which the European Union _ always a top-down,
elitist kind of notion _ has never really had. Small wonder that
the Euroskeptics loathe the idea of the euro as they do.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge dangers also, from the pro-European
perspective. If the European economies falter or crash before the
euro becomes fully accepted, the single currency and the European
Central Bank will be easy and obvious demagogic targets.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency is a quantum leap for other reasons, which
pro-Europeans prefer to smooth over.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why many Britons have never emotionally
accepted the EEC/EC/EU is that it was sold to them as a simple
common market, which it never really was.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Blair government, under withering Euroskeptic
fire, tends now to minimize the significance _ in terms of
sovereignty, in terms of loss of economic control _ of joining the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the existence of a single currency is likely to force
the Euroland governments, little by little, to take many more
economic and political decisions together.
</P>
<P>
   Scope will remain for independent policies on taxation (as even
the individual U.S. states or Canadian provinces have). But the
otherwise destabilizing effect of differing national economies will
force the Euroland governments to coordinate economic policy more
and more closely.
</P>
<P>
   To this extent, the decision of the new German government to
drop the Kohl-fired opposition to such a notion is not so much a
swing to the left as a recognition of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, the case for more direct democracy at
European level _ also inevitably a federalizing force _ would
become unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the EU has been one of setting seemingly purely
economic targets _ the common market, the single market, the single
currency _ which turn out to be deeply political targets.
</P>
<P>
   Removing economic barriers forces the removal of political
barriers (something Baroness Thatcher failed to grasp). The coming
of the euro sets that clock ticking again, more powerfully than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. There are good economic arguments for the Euro. There is a
case for more political unity in Europe, short _ far short _ of the
arrogant, bureaucratic, federal superstate of Euroskeptic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer you come to real lives of real people, as the
euro does, the more you need to be sure that the real people accept
what is happening in their name and why.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference with which the phantom phase of the euro will
be greeted throughout Euroland next week may baffle Euroskeptics;
it should also unsettle the pro-Europeans. &QL;

ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN MCCAIN TO TAKE 1ST BIG STEP TOWARD PRESIDENTIAL
BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain today will take his first major step
towards launching a presidential campaign by filing papers to
create a presi dential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, McCain becomes the first Republican to take such a
formal step, which allows him to begin raising the estimated $20
million he will need next year to be considered a viable candidate
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is out of the country on a family vacation and could not
be reached for comment. McCain is likely to make a formal announce
ment in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step for him to set up a committee,''
said Howard Opinsky, spokesman for the ``John McCain for President
Ex ploratory Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant signal of his intentions,'' Opinksy said.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire senator Warren Rudman, who will co-chair
McCain's exploratory committee, told The Republic Tuesday: ``I
think the trend is in the direction he will run, but to say it's a
certainty would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is likely to make his first remarks on the subject during
a speech Firday to a conference of conservative leaders at the
Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   His exploratory committee will become formal today with its
filing at the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate to file such papers is a Democrat,
former senator and basketball star Bill Bradley, who formed an
exploratory committee earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The filing is an important step for candidates who must begin
organizing at least by the early part of 1999 to successfully raise
funds, hire campaign consultants and build staffs in key states for
the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential candidates, in cluding Steve Forbes and Lamar
Alexander, who both ran unsuccess fully in 1996, already have
staffs in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans are waiting in the wings, including another
Arizo nan, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's early filing allows him to get a head start on the
early ``money primary,'' in which candi dates must raise about
$60,000 a day through 1999 to amass the war chest necessary to be
considered a serious contender in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain wants to determine whether he has the ability
to raise the massive sums necessary to launch a presidential
campaign, and to talk to Republicans in key early primary states to
see whether his maverick conservative message will sell in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain also must come to a decision with his wife,
Cindy, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain will make a formal announcement of his inten
tions in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rudman and others said McCain, 62, is well-positioned be
cause he has ridden a wave of favorable national publicity over his
role as GOP maverick in fights to pass campaign-finance reform and
to pass a national tobacco settle ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's truly anti-establishment . . . yet down deep he's a
Reagan Republican,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also well-known as a Vietname war hero, having served
5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   He has more than $2 million left over from this year's
re-election campaign that he can use as seed money for his
exploratory cam paign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign finance re ports show McCain continued
amassing funds even after it became apparent his Democrat opponent,
Ed Ranger, would have no chance of unseating the two-term senator.
Mc Cain raised nearly $100,000 after Election Day, the reports
show.
</P>
<P>
   They also show McCain has built a national fund-raising network
that could form the backbone of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has formed a politi cally potent circle of advisers,
including Rudman, who served on the Senate Ethics Committee during
the ``Keating Five'' hearings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given a mild rebuke for his role in the affair _ in
which he and four other senators were accused of intervening with
federal regulators on behalf of savings and loan kingpin Charles
Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman's presence on McCain's exploratory committee could defuse
the issue in a presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was purely political. John did nothing wrong,'' Rudman said
of McCain's appearance before the committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman also could open doors for McCain in New Hampshire, a key
early primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl is co-chair of the commit
tee.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Reagan staffers also are advising McCain,
including former chief of staff Ken Duberstein and adviser Michael
Deaver.
</P>
<P>
   Also, McCain has begun putting together a campaign staff that
could form the backbone of a solid presidential campaign. It
includes national GOP pollster Bill MacIn turff, national
fund-raising consult ant Carla Eudy and Opinsky, who served on
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's failed 1986 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain has re ceived ``significant encouragment'' to
enter the 2000 campaign from a wide array of people, including many
who have offered to provide financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain has acknowledged a legendary distaste for raising cam
paign cash. ``There's a lot of other things I'd rather do _ like
bang my head up against the wall,'' he told The Republic last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain's national stature could make it easier to
raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are factors in volved which make him a known
commodity that alleviate some of that fund-raising crunch,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain has re ceived a strong response so far in
national fund-raising circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very compelling figure. There is still a large portion
of Americans who do not know John McCain, but those that do are
very impressed by him and excited by him as a presidential
candidate,'' Opinsky said.

   PARIS _ The excited children aged 9 and 10 were learning about
the euro in the school parking lot. They were also trying to stand
on one another's feet when Madame was not looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurobus _ touring Normandy for the past three months,
spreading the gospel of the single currency _ had come to town. Or
in this case to the village of Cambes-en-Plaine, just north of
Caen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the euro mean to you?'' asked the bright, young
woman wearing jeans, and a stud in her nostril.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean we have less money, because everything will be
divided by six,'' said little Philippe. ``No,'' explained the
patient woman from the Treasury. ``Your pocket money will seem less
but it will buy as many sweets as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Florian, aged nine, piped up: ``The euro will mean we are
stronger because we will be 11 countries working together, instead
of one. It will mean that we don't have to pay to change our money
when we go abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright, young woman beamed. Florian's Papa, it turned out,
is a bank manager.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, faced with the historic prospect of the abolition of
the franc, the class displayed remarkable knowledge _ and blithe
indifference. Something similar could be said of France as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the everyday consequences seem so far away, with
the franc remaining in circulation for another three years, France
will greet the new year launch of the single currency with a wave
of apathetic enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls, almost 70 percent of French people
regard the euro positively. But the government and business
representatives who have manned the Eurobus through Calvados since
September report a surprisingly low level of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people are making a bit of a drama out of
it. They complain that they still think in old francs (abolished in
1960),'' reported Claire Godillon, director of judicial affairs for
the Caen Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, people don't seem to care much either way. There
are a few who are strongly in favor, a few who are violently
against. The great majority are mildly curious and accept it's
going to happen, whatever they think.''
</P>
<P>
   Although France voted only narrowly for the Maastricht Treaty
for shadowing the euro, the anti-single currency camp, on both the
left and right, has failed in recent efforts to stir up indignation
or concern.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates and inflation at historic lows, the economy
reasonably strong and the Bourse (stock market) at record highs,
it's difficult to make a short-term, economic case against the
euro. The political, sentimental case appears to have gone by the
board, for now.
</P>
<P>
   What will change from next month? Apart from the invisible but
vital fact that control of France's currency will pass to the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt, not very much.
</P>
<P>
   All restaurants and shops have been asked to display prices in
both currencies. Customers can pay in euros, by check or banker's
card, but only if the establishment is ready to accept them.
Employers can, if they wish, pay staff in euros from next month.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is, however, transforming the lives of at least two
people. The state Loto organized two special jackpot draws, just
before and just after Christmas. In each, the first prize was seven
million euros, so creating the first euro-millionaires. &QL;

<P>
   1999 will mark the start of a dangerous ``new era'' for
hurricane activity, weather scientists predict, with potentially
devastating consequences for densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The past four years have seen the most extreme hurricanes since
records began, according to analysis by Professor William Gray, an
atmospheric scientist based at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   If the pattern is sustained, he argues, severe winds will
continue to blow stronger and more frequently than ever _ and the
pattern is likely to be sustained for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 10 hurricanes and three ``intensive''
hurricane systems, with winds at more than 110 mph _ almost twice
as many in both categories as normal.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane ``season'' climaxed with Hurricane Mitch, the
fourth most powerful storm ever seen in the Caribbean, which killed
10,000 people, devastating Nicaragua and Honduras. The U.S.
government described Mitch as ``the worst disaster we have seen in
this hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Gray's team _ which also includes a senior U.S. government
meteorologist _ predicts that in 1999 there will be nine hurricanes
and four intense ones.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are particularly important, says Prof. Gray, because
``they cause the majority of hurricane-spawned destruction.''
Although they make up only about one quarter of all major storms,
they are responsible for 80 percent of the damage and loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists estimate that in 1999 the Caribbean and the
United States' Atlantic coast will be twice as likely _ and the
U.S. Gulf coast one-and-a-half times as likely _ to be hit by one
of these intense hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that because of the population build-up along
the U.S. East Coast, property damage could be severe,'' adds Prof.
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the scientists say, there have been 33 hurricanes
and 15 intense ones, making the period the ``most active four
consecutive years of hurricane activity on record.'' The effect is
all the more dramatic because the 25-year period up to 1994 was
unusually ``quiescent.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists base their predictions for 1999 on studies of a
whole series of weather phenomena, ranging from the temperature of
the Pacific Ocean to rainfall in the West African Sahel, which have
proved to be good indicators of hurricanes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The ``La Nina'' cold current in the Pacific goes with hurricanes
in the Atlantic. It began to take hold last year and the scientists
expect that it will persist through the next hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   Wet years in the Sahel are also linked with Atlantic hurricanes:
more rain fell than usual this year, and this too is expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Stratospheric winds, which change direction every few years, are
expected to go on blowing from the west, which produces hurricanes.
And global warming is also thought to make the storms worse as they
draw extra energy from warmer seas.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor, scientists believe, is the North
Atlantic Conveyor Belt Current, which carries warm water from the
Caribbean to east of Greenland as the Gulf Stream, and takes a deep
cold water current back again.
</P>
<P>
   When it is strong, they say, there are plenty of hurricanes.
They believe it strengthened between 1994 and 1995 and is now more
forceful than for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the current may well continue, bringing more
intense and frequent hurricanes ``for two or more decades.'' &QL;

   You may well be reading this surrounded by the detritus of
Christmas, a pile of his-and-her gifts stacked in the corner. Some
will very definitely be hers; perfume, earrings, lingerie, the
``must-have'' scarf. Others are indisputably his; not just boring
old socks, but all kinds of gadgetry including the year's newest
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   And looking down on all this, the Christmas cards that really do
have the yuk factor about them: those whiter than white, purer than
pure depictions of the Madonna and Child.
</P>
<P>
   Images of that sort, together with all those bottles of eau de
cologne and dinky bits of lace, put women firmly in their place and
say that the best way to be is the traditional way to be. Dutiful
mother, with _ to spice things up a bit _ a touch of the whore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these abiding images are confused this year's end with some
extraordinary ones; of an edition of Newsnight on the four-day Iraq
war in which the presenter in London, the interviewer talking to
Vice President Al Gore in Washington, and the correspondent out in
the field were all female.
</P>
<P>
   Film from the front showed women, thumbs up, returning from
successful air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it more apparent that the price of progress involves
women taking on the nastier roles formerly belonging to men, and
having to deal with the mess made by politicians, even if it means
using war as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these extreme moments of the past few weeks showing
women in their ultra-conventional guise, and the depressing
spectacle of them as partners to men at their beastliest, there is
still cause for cheer.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, more than any other year, is one we can salute as the
year of women.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, more than two-thirds of professional jobs are likely
to be taken by women in the coming year. Careers such as the law
are attracting more and more bright young female graduates, so that
now the majority of lawyers under 30 are female.
</P>
<P>
   The change has come about so fast that in the past 10 years, the
number of female lawyers has increased by 153 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of the young lawyer in 1999 being a woman is
matched by the chance that a doctor will be one. The proportion of
women reading medicine is now so high that in the coming 12 months,
just over half of the newly registered house doctors in this
country will be female.
</P>
<P>
   That these professions should attract women in such numbers
makes perfect sense. The nurturing and listening skills, combined
with the tact and people-friendly talent which so many women appear
to have as if by instinct, suit careers which involve dealing with
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the tougher, more cutthroat world of business will also see
women securing more and more of the plum jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, women in the office will not be so much typing letters
as dictating them _ together with the terms of the company. Not
just in Britain, but across the corporate world, the misogynist
will have to stand aside. There will be more females at the top of
the business world than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   And every day in 1999, we will have a reminder of just how far
women have come whenever we use a bank note. Not only will there be
the Queen's head on it, but a woman's signature too. Merlyn
Lowther, the Bank of England's new chief cashier, starts her job on
Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Women's emergence in both business and the professions puts paid
at last to the idea that they only go to work to fill in time
between leaving school and having a family.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries have gone up too, and in areas where skills are in
short supply _ such as accountancy, management consultancy and IT _
pay is just about equal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But can it get any better? And what about
poorer women in lower-grade work?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that for women both at the top and the bottom of
the ladder, the image on the Christmas card _ that of mother and
child _ comes back to haunt us still.
</P>
<P>
   For women at the top, the ultimate sacrifice so many are
expected to make is that of not having children. At the apex of the
corporate pyramid, there are very few women indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of the most senior positions in Fortune 500
companies are held by women, be they chairmen or chief executives.
And the characteristic which makes top women achievers quite
different from men is that far more of them remain childless.
</P>
<P>
   Slip back down the rungs of that career ladder, and you will
find women at the bottom also have a problem with children. This
time it is having them.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer struggle of successfully combining the raising of
children and the demands of a job means that women continue to make
up the majority of the low-paid.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are skewed by the extent to which many of these
low-paid jobs which women opt for are part-time. Without adequate
child care, there is little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all is lost. When Britain's national minimum wage becomes
law this year, two million low-paid workers will get the biggest
boost to their pay packets they will ever have received _ an
average of 30 percent. And for low-paid, read women.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy on low pay, together with new policies on child
care, will make 1999 the year when we will judge just how far the
Blair government reality matches up to its early rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the working family's tax credit system
comes into force, enabling those going back into work the chance to
set the cost of child care against their tax bills. This will form
a major plank of the National Child Care strategy, which will also
include the greater regulation of child care services.
</P>
<P>
   And that has to happen; without guarantees that nurseries are
safe places to leave children, mothers won't be going anywhere near
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   If all these moves in the lives of women (be they corporate
queen bees, professionals with purpose or working mothers) do make
1999 a true year of womankind, what more fitting finale to the 20th
century _ a hundred years which brought universal suffrage, the
opening of countless educational and career doors, and the dignity
bestowed by control over fertility, safe childbirth and public
repudiation of conjugal violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of increased opportunities, we still have a
long way to go. Look again at those Madonna and Child cards lining
your shelf. See how tightly encircling the arms are.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time they stretched out to others, so that women are no
longer alone with their children? A casting aside of the corrupting
influence of strident individualism, so that we become a community
of women and men together _ now that would be real progress in
1999. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ Mayors in French mountain regions are demanding a
crackdown on skiing ``hooligans'' after a series of serious
injuries over the Christmas holidays and a disturbing rise in the
number of accidents last year.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Bresse in the Vosges has called for
gendarmes-on-skis to be stationed on every slope. Several villages
and towns in the French Alps have given the force of law to the
``ten commandments'' in the safety code of the international skiing
federation.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher approach of the public authorities follows a 17
percent increase in the number of accidents on the French slopes in
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   It also follows a fracture-strewn opening to the 1998-99 season,
attributed partly to a vogue for new equipment, such as mono-skis
and snow-boards.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and ski professionals also report a surge of
outright bad and thoughtless behavior. ``We are in a time of
everyone-for-themselves, of selfishness,'' said Jean-Louis Costerg,
president of the French association of ski-slope managers. ``It's a
social problem, which starts in the towns, not in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The stricter public tone was set by the deputy chief prosecutor
in Albertville earlier this month, when he called for a three-month
prison sentence for a teenager who collided with and killed a
ten-year-old boy on a slope at Courchevel two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be very severe this winter with everyone who
thinks they can do whatever they please on the slopes,'' said Rene
Ternoy. In the event, the court passed a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Vaxelaire, mayor of Bresse, a ski-station in the Vosges,
called for direct policing of the slopes on Saturday after four
serious accidents in the mountains around his village in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time has come to put gendarmes on the slopes, as a
means of prevention but also as a warning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Prefect, or chief national government officer, in the Vosges
departement said he that sympathized with the request but doubted
whether it would be possible to implement such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the number of injuries is attributed partly to the
use of high-performance equipment by relative beginners. The
sharpest increase in the number of broken bones has been recorded
on the green and blue slopes, which are supposedly relatively safe
and easy.
</P>
<P>
   But local officials also blame the increased use of
``snow-boards'' by people who cut thoughtlessly through groups of
slower skiers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index, long home to the market's
hottest technology stocks, is on track for one of its best years
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday, the index had risen nearly 39 percent, far
ahead of the 28 percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index and more than double the 18 percent gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average this year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the surge is both a large number of Internet
stocks, which have been the object of investors' lovesick
affections _ and, according to one estimate, account for one-fifth
of this year's gain in the overall market _ and a dearth of
cyclical companies, whose values have been crushed by the collapse
in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even a surge in oil and agricultural prices, however, would have
trouble getting investors as excited as they have become by big
Internet companies like Yahoo, Amazon.com and Netscape. Those
stocks, which have recorded three- or four-digit percentage gains
this year, plus smaller companies like Ebay, Mindspring Enterprises
and Infoseek, which have recorded similar gains, have put the
Nasdaq in line for its third-best performance since it was begun in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences. The 10 largest stocks in the Nasdaq
index account for more than 39 percent of its value, nearly double
the weighting of the 10 largest stocks in the S&AMP;P 500. The effect
of those differences is that movements in the value of the biggest
stocks, like Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems, have a greater
impact on the Nasdaq index than on the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   That effect can especially be seen in the performance this year
of the Nasdaq 100 index, a subset of the composite, comprising, as
its name suggests, the 100 largest Nasdaq companies. The Nasdaq 100
index has gained 84 percent this year, a blazing performance that
is unmatched in its history, which dates to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, which merged earlier
this year, will soon attempt to capitalize on the success of the
Nasdaq technology stocks by offering a new product that tracks the
Nasdaq 100. The new product, a unit investment trust, is similar to
the Amex's popular Spiders, Diamonds and Webs unit trusts, which,
respectively, track the S&AMP;P 500, the Dow industrials and a variety
of foreign stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   But in designing the Nasdaq unit trust, the exchange has changed
the way it calculates its 100-stock index, restricting the
influence of technology stocks and thus removing some of the fuel
that has thrust the index to such historic heights.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that dampens investors' reception of the new product
remains to be seen. Judging by their willingness to pay virtually
any price for Internet stocks, however, it is easy to imagine that
investors will care not a whit.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some numbers. Wilshire Associates, which manages money
for institutions and also compiles a series of stock indexes,
recently measured the contribution of Internet-related stocks to
the performance of the Wilshire 5000 index, a yardstick that
includes all of the 7,400 publicly traded companies based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   For that purpose, Wilshire defined as Internet-related any
company whose business would be materially affected if the Internet
ceased to exist _ a broad definition that included some giant
companies like Microsoft, but not others, like Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilshire found that through Dec. 23, 4.1 percentage points of
the 21.8 percent gain in the Wilshire 5000 _ or roughly one-fifth
of the total _ came from Internet-related stocks. During that time,
the value of those Internet stocks climbed to 6 percent of the
overall market from 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is only logical to assume that the effect of Internet stocks
on the Nasdaq composite index is as large or larger. At the
beginning of 1998, Yahoo, the 65th-largest stock traded on Nasdaq,
accounted for only about 0.2 percent of the Nasdaq composite index.
By the end of November, it had grown to 0.8 percent of the index _
a fourfold increase that placed it among the 10 largest Nasdaq
companies. And since the end of November, Yahoo has climbed even
further.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is betting that individual investors, in search of a
piece of that action, will snap up shares of the Nasdaq 100 unit
trust, just as they have the Spiders, Diamonds and Webs.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasdaq ran into a problem. For tax and other reasons, Nasdaq
had to adjust downward the influence of the biggest stocks in the
index _ Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, MCI Worldcom and Dell Computer _
which together accounted for more than 60 percent of Nasdaq 100.
Before the adjustment, Microsoft alone made up 25 percent of the
index.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those five stocks account for about 40 percent of the
index. In the future, the index will be reassessed quarterly, and
if the biggest stocks grow to account for more than 48 percent of
the index, they will again be scaled back to 40 percent. Similarly,
Microsoft now measures about 15 percent of the index; if it grows
to 24 percent, it will be cut back to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sound complicated? Think of it as selling the portfolio's
winners. If investors continue to favor large technology stocks, as
they have this year, the Nasdaq 100 index, and therefore the trust,
will be forced to scale back those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Garnick, an equity derivatives strategist at Merrill
Lynch, says the reconfiguration is in fact a good development
because it makes the index less of a sector product and therefore
more attractive as a general equity-market benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining weight are sectors that are not traditionally associated
with Nasdaq _ like consumer cyclicals, which feature companies like
Costco, the operator of wholesale warehouses. The cyclicals went to
8 percent of the index from 4 percent, Ms. Garnick said. And
overall, technology stocks make up about 67 percent of the index,
compared with 76 percent before the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether investors are looking for another
general market index _ or worse, whether Nasdaq's attempt to reduce
the influence of technology stocks on its new index product
portends an end to the technology-stock boom.

PHOENIX-AREA AIR POLLUTION WORST IN 2 WINTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Air pollution hit its worst level in two winters
Tuesday, spurring pleas for Phoenix-area residents to curb driving
and not light wood-burning fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   That means no fireplace burning until 10 a.m. today. And
motorists should try to minimize their time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combine your trips so you're not backtracking,'' said Steven
Peplau, air-quality manager for the Maricopa County Environmental
Services Department. ``Take a bus where you can, carpool where you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since Maricopa County officials
have had to call a high-pollution advisory. And the timing couldn't
be worse.
</P>
<P>
   It comes two days before the deadline for the Valley of the Sun,
as the Phoenix area is known, to record two straight years of good
readings for carbon monoxide pollution. If that happens, Valley
officials can apply for clean-air status from the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is rated ``serious'' for carbon monoxide, as well as
for particulate and ozone pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Peplau blamed the rising bad-air levels on a spate of
post-holiday driving and folks soaking up the ambience of a roaring
fire. Throw in the relatively still weather, and conditions are
ripe for an inversion that traps polluted air close to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is wind,'' Peplau said.
</P>
<P>
   That might come Thursday, when a strong airmass is predicted to
move across the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The haze hugging the Valley in recent days is a mix of
pollutants, including carbon monoxide, which is invisible. The
color comes from the tiny bits of soot and grime caused by a
variety of sources, ranging from fireplace particles to
diesel-truck exhaust to the road dust kicked up by car tires
traveling millions of miles daily.
</P>
<P>
   To get through the end of year, extra precautions are needed to
avoid violating federal health standards for carbon-monoxide
pollution, Peplau said.
</P>
<P>
   If pollution levels can be kept at bay through the end of
Thursday, it will strengthen Valley officials' bid to have the EPA
classify the area as meeting clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first time since the standards were created in
the 1970 federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the designation would be more intangible than
practical. The Valley would no longer face the threat of federal
sanctions for failing to meet clean-air standards, and it could
erase one of three black marks against its air-quality ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But measures put in place over the last two decades to cut
carbon monoxide would remain in place. Those include the
vehicle-emissions test, cleaner fuels and federal mandates on
cleaner-burning automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Because carbon monoxide is created primarily by vehicle exhaust,
the pollution advisories target driving.
</P>
<P>
   But fireplaces also boost carbon monoxide, since wood and wax,
or ``fake,'' logs burn incompletely, Peplau said.
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace ban does not apply to people who have an
EPA-approved wood-burning fireplace, or alternatively fueled
fireplaces, such as those that run on natural gas or electricity.

LONG WAR SAPS SPIRIT AND MONEY IN CONGO
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ ``Je suis low bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever ``low bat'' starts flashing on their cellular phones,
people here know that their batteries are nearly drained. The
phrase is a fashionable one here in the capital's deluxe hotels and
gated villas, a coinage peculiar to a place where regular phones
don't work and only the thin upper layer of society can afford
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, as Congo approaches its fifth month of a war
that has drawn in at least seven of its neighbors, the phrase has
acquired a wider meaning. People now are as likely to utter ``I am
low bat'' in describing their feelings toward the war as their
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an army that can stand on its own,'' said Moise
Musangana, an editor of Le Potentiel, an independent daily
newspaper. ``We have to rely on our allies. War costs money that
the Congo doesn't have. With each passing day, things are getting
worse for Kabila. Why does he refuse to negotiate? People are sick
of this war. They're low bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments stand in sharp contrast to the wartime euphoria in
August and September, when at the last minute the government of
President Laurent Kabila won the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean
troops to repel rebel soldiers on the outskirts of Kinshasa. But
after the government's dramatic victory here, the Congolese appear
increasingly weary of a war that has brought hardships and that the
government warns will be long.
</P>
<P>
   Mawapanga Mwana Nanga, Kabila's minister of finance and
agriculture, waved away reports of rapidly deteriorating economic
and living conditions. ``Freedom has no price,'' he said. ``Whether
it takes us 50 years or 100 years, we will resist until they leave
us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, whose popularity soared after the failed assault on
Kinshasa, seems to have squandered those dividends by failing to
rally the support of the internal political opposition and the
West. Instead, Kabila has become more isolated inside his own
country and more dependent on foreign allies whose stomach for a
long war is uncertain, said officials in government and the
opposition, as well as Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   And so Kabila's standing has slipped, even as it has been
confirmed that his government and nation have been the victims of
aggression by foreign countries; after long denying any involvement
in the war, Rwanda and Uganda have acknowledged that their soldiers
are backing Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of sympathy for the government, more than in
August, because it's clear to me now that there was an invasion,''
said a senior European diplomat in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other diplomats said they were reluctant to defend
Kabila, who has consistently alienated the West since taking
office. What is more, a show of support would be interpreted as a
rebuke of the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are considered
loyal allies, especially in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the assault on Kinshasa, the Kabila government mobilized
popular support for the war through anti-Tutsi propaganda, and
international relief organizations raised concerns that the
campaign would lead to a witch hunt for ethnic Tutsi in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Tutsi who have lived in eastern Congo for generations
but who have never been granted citizenship are part of the
movement trying to overthrow Kabila. They are believed to have
close ties with the Tutsi-led government in Rwanda, where in 1994
the Hutu majority killed half a million Tutsi in a genocide that
has had profound repercussions on the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies that it targeted Tutsi in August. Even so,
opposition officials, Western diplomatic officials and others said
the government had toned down its anti-Tutsi drive in the last
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understood that their anti-Tutsi campaign was looked at
very negatively by the international community,'' said Olivier
Kamitatu, the director of Berci, the leading polling agency here.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda helped Kabila overthrow the enduring dictator,
Mobutu Sese Seko, in 1997, but Kabila's closeness to the Tutsi-led
Rwandan government made him extremely unpopular at home, and he
eventually severed his ties with his former allies.
</P>
<P>
   The president's popularity has eroded in the last month as
memories of the Kinshasa victory and the anti-Tutsi propaganda
recede before the grim realities of economic hardship and a war
without any apparent end, Kamitatu said.
</P>
<P>
   Living under a military regime, in a state of war, most
residents interviewed in Kinshasa expressed support for Kabila. But
the responses were measured compared with the full-throated answers
of August; few nowadays echoed the universal response in August,
when residents of Kinshasa would raise their voice indignantly at
the subject of the rebels trying to depose Kabila, and say: ``Let
him work!''
</P>
<P>
   In La Cite, where most of this city's five million Congolese
live, many said the government should negotiate with the rebels,
making an important distinction between foreign troops and
Congolese rebels. So far, Kabila has refused to meet the rebels,
arguing that they are only puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Katupo-Thenza, 59, stood in the backyard of his squat,
gray house in Mikondo, a slum that was shelled heavily by the
government because it had been infiltrated by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are OK,'' Katupo-Thenza said, near a wall whose
bricks had been dislodged by gunfire here and there. ``The
Congolese rebels, we need to negotiate with them. They're our
brothers after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition parties also support negotiations with the
rebels. Etienne Tshisekedi, the country's most popular opposition
leader, has proposed a national peace conference that would include
the Congolese rebels, said his political adviser, Jean-Joseph
Mukendi.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of how entrenched the no-negotiation
position is in Kabila's government that even a minister who said he
has lost great faith in the president ruled out talks with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would the goals of negotiations be?'' he said, adding
that two possibilities _ territorial concessions or sharing of
power with the rebels _ were both unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The minister said he now had only ``25 percent confidence in
Kabila.'' In recent months, he said, the circle of advisers around
Kabila had grown smaller, and included mainly men from his native
province, Katanga. The circle was one reason that Kabila had not
reached out to opposition groups, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Mukendi said: ``In September, there was a lot of goodwill toward
Kabila. But there has been no movement toward greater political
openness. It was a missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing war has made openness impossible for now, said
Leonard She Okitundu, the minister of human rights. ``If we had
liberalized,'' he said, ``it would mean that everyone would be able
to hold demonstrations, and that the enemy would be able to exploit
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Okitundu said he believed that neither politics nor
diplomacy would end the war. ``The stronger one on the battlefield
will win,'' he said. ``This could last a long time.''

ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN MCCAIN TO TAKE 1ST BIG STEP TOWARD PRESIDENTIAL
BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain today will take his first major step
towards launching a presidential campaign by filing papers to
create a presi dential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, McCain becomes the first Republican to take such a
formal step, which allows him to begin raising the estimated $20
million he will need next year to be considered a viable candidate
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is out of the country on a family vacation and could not
be reached for comment. McCain is likely to make a formal announce
ment in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step for him to set up a committee,''
said Howard Opinsky, spokesman for the ``John McCain for President
Ex ploratory Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant signal of his intentions,'' Opinksy said.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire senator Warren Rudman, who will co-chair
McCain's exploratory committee, told The Republic Tuesday: ``I
think the trend is in the direction he will run, but to say it's a
certainty would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is likely to make his first remarks on the subject during
a speech Firday to a conference of conservative leaders at the
Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   His exploratory committee will become formal today with its
filing at the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate to file such papers is a Democrat,
former senator and basketball star Bill Bradley, who formed an
exploratory committee earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The filing is an important step for candidates who must begin
organizing at least by the early part of 1999 to successfully raise
funds, hire campaign consultants and build staffs in key states for
the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential candidates, in cluding Steve Forbes and Lamar
Alexander, who both ran unsuccess fully in 1996, already have
staffs in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans are waiting in the wings, including another
Arizo nan, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's early filing allows him to get a head start on the
early ``money primary,'' in which candi dates must raise about
$60,000 a day through 1999 to amass the war chest necessary to be
considered a serious contender in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain wants to determine whether he has the ability
to raise the massive sums necessary to launch a presidential
campaign, and to talk to Republicans in key early primary states to
see whether his maverick conservative message will sell in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain also must come to a decision with his wife,
Cindy, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain will make a formal announcement of his inten
tions in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rudman and others said McCain, 62, is well-positioned be
cause he has ridden a wave of favorable national publicity over his
role as GOP maverick in fights to pass campaign-finance reform and
to pass a national tobacco settle ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's truly anti-establishment . . . yet down deep he's a
Reagan Republican,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also well-known as a Vietname war hero, having served
5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   He has more than $2 million left over from this year's
re-election campaign that he can use as seed money for his
exploratory cam paign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign finance re ports show McCain continued
amassing funds even after it became apparent his Democrat opponent,
Ed Ranger, would have no chance of unseating the two-term senator.
Mc Cain raised nearly $100,000 after Election Day, the reports
show.
</P>
<P>
   They also show McCain has built a national fund-raising network
that could form the backbone of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has formed a politi cally potent circle of advisers,
including Rudman, who served on the Senate Ethics Committee during
the ``Keating Five'' hearings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given a mild rebuke for his role in the affair _ in
which he and four other senators were accused of intervening with
federal regulators on behalf of savings and loan kingpin Charles
Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman's presence on McCain's exploratory committee could defuse
the issue in a presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was purely political. John did nothing wrong,'' Rudman said
of McCain's appearance before the committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman also could open doors for McCain in New Hampshire, a key
early primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl is co-chair of the commit
tee.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Reagan staffers also are advising McCain,
including former chief of staff Ken Duberstein and adviser Michael
Deaver.
</P>
<P>
   Also, McCain has begun putting together a campaign staff that
could form the backbone of a solid presidential campaign. It
includes national GOP pollster Bill MacIn turff, national
fund-raising consult ant Carla Eudy and Opinsky, who served on
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's failed 1986 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain has re ceived ``significant encouragment'' to
enter the 2000 campaign from a wide array of people, including many
who have offered to provide financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain has acknowledged a legendary distaste for raising cam
paign cash. ``There's a lot of other things I'd rather do _ like
bang my head up against the wall,'' he told The Republic last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain's national stature could make it easier to
raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are factors in volved which make him a known
commodity that alleviate some of that fund-raising crunch,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain has re ceived a strong response so far in
national fund-raising circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very compelling figure. There is still a large portion
of Americans who do not know John McCain, but those that do are
very impressed by him and excited by him as a presidential
candidate,'' Opinsky said.

<P>
   McCain is out of the country on a family vacation and could not
be reached for comment. McCain is likely to make a formal announce
ment in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step for him to set up a committee,''
said Howard Opinsky, spokesman for the ``John McCain for President
Ex ploratory Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant signal of his intentions,'' Opinksy said.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire senator Warren Rudman, who will co-chair
McCain's exploratory committee, told The Republic Tuesday: ``I
think the trend is in the direction he will run, but to say it's a
certainty would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is likely to make his first remarks on the subject during
a speech Firday to a conference of conservative leaders at the
Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   His exploratory committee will become formal today with its
filing at the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate to file such papers is a Democrat,
former senator and basketball star Bill Bradley, who formed an
exploratory committee earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The filing is an important step for candidates who must begin
organizing at least by the early part of 1999 to successfully raise
funds, hire campaign consultants and build staffs in key states for
the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential candidates, in cluding Steve Forbes and Lamar
Alexander, who both ran unsuccess fully in 1996, already have
staffs in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans are waiting in the wings, including another
Arizo nan, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's early filing allows him to get a head start on the
early ``money primary,'' in which candi dates must raise about
$60,000 a day through 1999 to amass the war chest necessary to be
considered a serious contender in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain wants to determine whether he has the ability
to raise the massive sums necessary to launch a presidential
campaign, and to talk to Republicans in key early primary states to
see whether his maverick conservative message will sell in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain also must come to a decision with his wife,
Cindy, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain will make a formal announcement of his inten
tions in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rudman and others said McCain, 62, is well-positioned be
cause he has ridden a wave of favorable national publicity over his
role as GOP maverick in fights to pass campaign-finance reform and
to pass a national tobacco settle ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's truly anti-establishment . . . yet down deep he's a
Reagan Republican,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also well-known as a Vietname war hero, having served
5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   He has more than $2 million left over from this year's
re-election campaign that he can use as seed money for his
exploratory cam paign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign finance re ports show McCain continued
amassing funds even after it became apparent his Democrat opponent,
Ed Ranger, would have no chance of unseating the two-term senator.
Mc Cain raised nearly $100,000 after Election Day, the reports
show.
</P>
<P>
   They also show McCain has built a national fund-raising network
that could form the backbone of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has formed a politi cally potent circle of advisers,
including Rudman, who served on the Senate Ethics Committee during
the ``Keating Five'' hearings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given a mild rebuke for his role in the affair _ in
which he and four other senators were accused of intervening with
federal regulators on behalf of savings and loan kingpin Charles
Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman's presence on McCain's exploratory committee could defuse
the issue in a presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was purely political. John did nothing wrong,'' Rudman said
of McCain's appearance before the committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman also could open doors for McCain in New Hampshire, a key
early primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl is co-chair of the commit
tee.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Reagan staffers also are advising McCain,
including former chief of staff Ken Duberstein and adviser Michael
Deaver.
</P>
<P>
   Also, McCain has begun putting together a campaign staff that
could form the backbone of a solid presidential campaign. It
includes national GOP pollster Bill MacIn turff, national
fund-raising consult ant Carla Eudy and Opinsky, who served on
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's failed 1986 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said McCain has re ceived ``significant encouragment'' to
enter the 2000 campaign from a wide array of people, including many
who have offered to provide financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain has acknowledged a legendary distaste for raising cam
paign cash. ``There's a lot of other things I'd rather do _ like
bang my head up against the wall,'' he told The Republic last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain's national stature could make it easier to
raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are factors in volved which make him a known
commodity that alleviate some of that fund-raising crunch,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said McCain has re ceived a strong response so far in
national fund-raising circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very compelling figure. There is still a large portion
of Americans who do not know John McCain, but those that do are
very impressed by him and excited by him as a presidential
candidate,'' Opinsky said.

<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-RACINE (Paris) _ Jean Racine may not be a household name
in the English-speaking theater world, but the great 17th-century
French tragedian is not faring too well at home, either. Across
Europe, Racine is also suffering as French loses its place to
English as the compulsory second language. His grandiose Greek- and
Roman-inspired tragedies about lives torn apart by destiny, love,
ambition, betrayal and cruelty were always regarded as pillars of
French classicism. Yet, because his genius was thought to lie in
his use of language, notably his rolling waves of alexandrine
verse, the whole point was to read Racine in French. And nowadays
fewer people can do that: the number of Europeans studying French _
or able to understand a play in French _ continues to fall. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-DAVIES (Undated) _ Dennis Russell Davies is about to give
up the music directorship of the American Composers Orchestra, a
contemporary-music ensemble he helped found in 1975. But his formal
parting will be as protracted as a diva's farewell tour. His final
project as music director, ``20th-Century Snapshots,'' a series of
11 thematic concerts, begins January 10 with ``The Gershwin
Circle'' and ends in 2001. A survey of Cuban works in March and a
program of Walt Whitman settings in May round out the first season.
By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-HENZE (Undated) _ No composer since World War II has been
more resistant to pigeonholing than Hans Werner Henze. At 72, Henze
is still a force in European modernism. Yet his life's work can be
seen as an attempt to revitalize traditional Classical forms and
genres _ sonata, concerto and symphony, theme and variations, and
especially opera _ through cutting-edge innovation. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   COMPOSER-IMITATIONS (Undated) _ Anyone who listens to new music
these days will be familiar with the experience of deja entendu
evoked by the works of many composers favored by our musical
institutions. The name in the program may be that of a
contemporary; there may even be a live person sitting in the
audience. But the piece turns out to be shamelessly reminiscent of
the style of someone long dead, and the individual among us _ now
perhaps taking a bow onstage _ is yet another ghostwriter on behalf
of the past. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-ROWE (Undated) _ During a lifetime of obsessive creativity,
Nellie Mae Rowe apparently gave little thought to her place in art
history. The hundreds of drawings and collages she made in her
three-room house in rural Vinings, Ga., the figures she fashioned
out of old stockings and chewing gum, and the densely decorated
found-object environment she created in her home and yard were to
her simply an intense and deeply satisfying form of play. This
month, however, the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan is
presenting Rowe not only as an important 20th-century artist but as
one whose work bridges several categories in the sometimes
contentious world of folk, outsider and self-taught art. By Tessa
DeCarlo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HILARY&AMP;JACKIE (Undated) _ A young instrumentalist of
promise, identified in the movie with a grand post-Romantic
concerto, cut down by mental and physical illness: haven't we seen
this film before? In part, yes. Anand Tucker's new ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' the ``true'' story of the English cellist Jacqueline du
Pre and her elder sister, draws formulaically on Scott Hicks'
``Shine,'' the 1996 film biography of the Australian pianist David
Helfgott, notably in the way it evokes a disastrous breakdown in
midperformance. But there are great differences as well, especially
in ultimate effect. By James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BERGMAN-CONFESSIONS (Undated) _ This bit of dialogue is
Ingmar Bergman at his most resonant, a slightly ridiculous cry of
pain, the ridicule softened by an implicit sympathy. How can you
not sympathize with someone so pitifully exposed in the
contradictions of being human? The story of ``Private
Confessions,'' which opens January 6, is classic Bergman territory
as well. An unhappily married minister's wife has embarked on an
affair with a young seminarian; torn between guilt at lying and a
belief in the essential truth of her love, she turns to an old
friend, her confirmation priest, whose counsel will alter her life
in unintended ways. ``Private Confessions'' is enormously moving,
with a moral and emotional gravity that has become increasingly
rare in movies. By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-HBO-SOPRANOS (Undated) _ The concept for the new hourlong HBO
series ``The Sopranos'' sounds simple enough: an upwardly mobile
Mafia capo from North Jersey slams head-on into a midlife crisis,
enters therapy and starts taking Prozac. Funny? Sometimes. Scary?
Sure. Human? Very. But simple? No. It's about as simple as trying
to dispose of a fresh corpse in the Meadowlands after dark when the
lip of the construction Dumpster is just too high to reach. By
Charles Strum.

MOST STATES ARE MEETING WORK REQUIREMENTS OF NEW WELFARE LAW

(sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first official data from the federal government
show that most states are meeting the work requirements of the 1996
welfare law, with 28 percent of adults on the rolls participating
in some type of work activity, administration officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether states will be able to meet the more
stringent requirements that take effect in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare reform law was designed to promote work, and
that's exactly what's happening,'' President Clinton's chief
domestic policy adviser, Bruce N. Reed, said. ``More people on
welfare are working, and more people are leaving welfare to go to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   All 36 of the states reporting data for 1997 met the work
requirement, with work participation rates ranging from 13.5
percent in Louisiana to 96.7 percent in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law reversed six decades of social welfare policy,
eliminated the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the
nation's poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run
their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the law stipulates that adults must be working in no
fewer than 25 percent of the families on welfare, or else states
are subject to financial penalties. This figure rises by 5
percentage points a year, to 50 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, states get credit for reducing the number of
people on welfare. The federal work requirements are reduced, or
liberalized, for states that have reduced their welfare rolls since
1995, as almost all states have. Nationwide, the number of people
on welfare has dropped by nearly one-third, to 8.4 million, since
August 1996, when the welfare bill was signed.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many welfare experts doubted that the states could
meet the law's work requirements. State officials say doing so
required fundamental changes in the expectations of welfare
recipients and the culture of welfare offices, shifting the focus
from the issuance of checks to employment and jobs. In 10 states,
fewer than 25 percent of the adult welfare recipients were working
in 1997, but the states still met the law's requirements, because
these states reduced their welfare rolls and were rewarded by
having their work requirement lowered.
</P>
<P>
   States in this category include California, with a work
participation rate of 20.6 percent, Georgia (20.6 percent),
Louisiana (13.5 percent), Maryland (18.3 percent), Mississippi
(17.2 percent) and Texas (19.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Iowa, Oregon, Wisconsin and Wyoming were among the
``high performers.'' In each of these states, more than half of the
adult welfare recipients were working or participating in work
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie R. Marino, acting commissioner of the Connecticut
Department of Social Services, said the state, with a 58.4 percent
work participation rate, had a strong economy and had helped people
move from welfare to work by providing Medicaid, child care, rental
assistance and transportation services. Ms. Marino said the 1996
law provided ``a sense of empowerment, allowing people to realize
that they could do something productive with their lives, and that
we would do something to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the metropolitan region, New York state, with 27.9
percent of its adult welfare recipients working in 1997, was right
around the national average, while New Jersey, at 20.7 percent, was
below. New York has about one-tenth of the nation's welfare
families, and slightly more than two-thirds of the state's welfare
recipients live in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   James D. Neely, deputy director of Oregon's welfare program,
said the state had enforced stringent work requirements since the
early 1990s and had spent ``a substantial amount of state money,
over and above what we had to spend,'' to help people move from
welfare to work. ``Anybody who comes through the door has to work
or perform some activity to get ready for work as soon as
possible,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, welfare experts said, people who remain on the rolls
will be harder to place in jobs because they have fewer skills,
less education and less work experience, and are more likely to
have physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, states will have more money to spend on
training and preparing each person who remains on the rolls,
because the amount of the federal grant for each state is fixed
even though the welfare rolls are plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Very few welfare recipients are exempt from the work
requirements of the 1996 law. States may, if they choose, exempt
single parents caring for children under 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon M. Daly, vice president of Catholic Charities USA,
said: ``If you, as a single mother, have one or two children
between the ages of 1 and 5 and you have to work too, it's very
hard. Often you don't have time for school or training, so you're
locked into a low-paying job.''
</P>
<P>
   The new calculations were made by the federal Department of
Health and Human Services, from data submitted by the states. They
are consistent with new data from the Census Bureau that show a
substantial increase in the proportion of single women on welfare
who have earnings from employment. Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for
the department, said the census data also showed an increase in
average monthly earnings for welfare recipients with jobs, to $592
in the final months of 1997 from $500 at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While most states have been focusing on the numerical goals for
employment of welfare recipients in general, the 1996 law set
separate goals for two-parent families, and many states have failed
to meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 percent of two-parent families were working or
participating in work activities in 1997. The basic goal, set by
the 1996 law, was that 75 percent of such families should have been
working in 1997, but the specific goal for each state was adjusted
to give states credit for reducing their welfare rolls. A family
was in compliance if one parent, or both parents together, worked
35 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 states reporting data on two-parent families, 17
failed to meet their goals, even after the goals were reduced.
Two-parent families account for a small proportion of all welfare
families, just 7 percent of the national total.

   BLACKS-SOUTH (Ty, Ty, Georgia) _ In last month's election, Rep.

convincingly in a rural, conservative district where nearly
two-thirds of the voters are white. Many black politicians have
managed to attract white support in urban, New South areas like
Atlanta. But Bishop's electoral success demonstrates that even in
the most rural and impoverished districts, a significant number of
white Southerners no longer view race as an absolute obstacle to
voting for a black politician who shares their thinking, votes

RUSSIA FAILS TO MAKE DEBT PAYMENT TO BANKS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia on Tuesday failed to make a $362 million
payment on Soviet-era debt that it owes to commercial banks around
the world, a move that U.S. officials, the International Monetary
Fund and lenders to Russia fear could signal a growing movement in
Moscow to simply default on the country's obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders, led by Bank of America, stopped short of calling
Tuesday's action a default, even though it appeared to be exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   In August, in the midst of the devaluation of the ruble and the
firing of the economic reformers who had negotiated a bailout of
the country with the International Monetary Fund, Russia failed to
pay hundreds of millions of dollars it owed to foreign governments.
But Tuesday's action was the first in which it failed to pay
private creditors, on whom the country's chances of economic
recovery hinge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needed to reach agreement with 95 percent of its
creditors to restructure its debt, essentially allowing it to pay
the money back over a far longer period of time. But only 72
percent of those creditors gave approval to a plan under which the
commercial banks would accept government-issued bonds as an
alternative to cash. Russia insists that it only needed to win the
approval of two-thirds of the creditors, and therefore it is not
technically in default.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, the issue of default does not exist at this
point,'' Vladimir Yatsenko, an aide to the chairman of
Vnesheconombank, Russia's paying agent, was quoted as saying in a
Bloomberg News dispatch from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America said through a spokesman that it was seeking
clarification of Yatsenko's reported statement but that the 95
percent approval requirement from creditors remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The payment itself is not a major problem for the banks, and the
markets had long ago anticipated that Russia would find itself
unable to pay, or simply would be unwilling to do so. But the
signal that Russia's action sent seems bound to reverberate in
capitals around the world, especially in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   International economic officials said they suspected that Russia
had decided to simply default on selected foreign debt. ``The
question,'' said one official who has been engaged in discussions
with the Russians, ``is whether this is an act of desperation or a
negotiating tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the government of President Boris
Yeltsin has determined that there is little chance that private
banks will lend it money for years to come, even if Russia begins
to collect taxes, impose fiscal austerity, and come to terms with
the IMF over a new loan package. With no relationship left to
destroy with the commercial banks, this theory goes, the Russians
have simply made a determination to halt repayments.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that the default may simply amount to a
negotiating strategy, to force the banks to restructure the debt on
Moscow's terms. ``This may be their equivalent of an offer we can't
refuse,'' one banker dealing with Russia said last week. ``They
want us to think that the choice is between getting something _ who
knows how much _ someday, or getting nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been engaged in a parallel negotiation with
other governments to which it owes money, a group known as the
Paris Club. But that debt cannot be restructured until Russia and
the IMF work out a new agreement, to replace the failed accord of
last July. At that time, the IMF agreed to provide Russia with $17
billion in additional aid, in return for adherence to a strict
agreement with the fund on spending, tax collection and social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement was essentially shattered in August, after Russia
received a little more than $4 billion in aid. The IMF has cut off
further payments, and the assumption in Washington is that any
future agreement with the fund will be smaller and more
``backloaded,'' meaning that Russia would have to meet many of the
conditions of the new loan before much cash is forwarded to Moscow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's failure to meet the payment schedule came as the
Clinton administration announced that the secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright, would visit Russia from Jan. 25 through Jan.
27, to launch long-delayed strategic arms reduction talks and to
try to patch over differences on how to deal with Iraq. But it is
unclear how the United States and Russia can begin arms talks over
Start III when the Duma, Russia's Parliament, has refused to ratify
Start II.
</P>
<P>
   The arms talks and Russia's economic troubles are closely
linked. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has pledged to win approval
on Start II, which was signed in 1993, in part because he wants to
save the money required to maintain and upgrade a large nuclear
fleet. But it is unclear whether Albright will deal at any length
with Russia's crushing financial problems.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the 13
House Republicans planning to prosecute an impeachment trial of
President Clinton in the Senate clashed on Tuesday over whether to
call any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also proposed beginning the Senate trial on Jan. 11, after
initial procedural steps next week, and finishing within two weeks,
a timetable many Democrats dismiss as overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   How long a trial lasts depends in large part on whether the
Senate relies on the evidence gathered by the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, or whether the House managers present witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are witnesses required? I don't think so,'' Lott, R-Miss.,
said in a telephone interview from his home state with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the record is there to be reviewed, read, presented in
a form'' that the House prosecutors choose, the senator said. ``I
think that would be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   But in their first strategy meeting since Dec. 19, when the
House approved two articles of impeachment, Rep. Henry J. Hyde,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his
12 hand-picked managers agreed that they had to present witnesses
to make their best case to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot proceed to a trial without witnesses,'' Rep. Steve
Buyer, R-Ind., said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told reporters afterward, ``I'd
think they'd want to hear some people live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, has control over the rules and procedures
of the trial, a fact that McCollum acknowledged on Tuesday when he
noted that the House managers are ``guests'' of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has made it clear that he wants the Senate to wrap up an
impeachment trial quickly, although the White House could call
witnesses in Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   But even one of the president's strongest Democratic defenders,
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, said on Tuesday, ``there
is a bipartisan belief that there should be no witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Lott's proposed schedule, the two articles of impeachment
approved by the House would be read on the Senate floor on Jan. 7,
the day after the 106th Congress convenes.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, Lott said in an interview on NBC News, would begin on
Jan. 11 and last ``a week or two,'' with Jan. 22 being a target
date for finishing. The president is scheduled to deliver his State
of the Union address on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Under this scenario, the Senate would vote on the two articles _
perjury before a federal grand jury and obstruction of justice.
Most senators have said they do not believe there are the 67 votes
necessary to remove Clinton. So if the president was acquitted, the
Senate might vote on a resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were amused on Tuesday to see the division
among the Republicans over calling witnesses. And they said they
were pleased with Lott's plan for a two-week trial, though they
have not formally agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the Senate minority leader, said no one had ``conclusively signed
off'' on Lott's proposal, including his insistence that no
witnesses be summoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that that's the way they are moving,'' said
Ms. Schmelzer, who noted that Daschle and Lott were talking at
least twice a week during the congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no unanimous consent resolution that has been
written,'' she said. ``Until that happens, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Schmelzer added that Democrats would like to see a
speedy trial and that witnesses would probably make it more
protracted.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, however, were nearly insistent on a
full-blown trial with as many as 15 witnesses. While the managers
did not discuss specific witnesses in their meeting, lawmakers said
afterward that they could include Monica S. Lewinsky; Betty Currie,
the president's secretary, and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The managers and House Republican aides said they were stunned
and angered by Lott's remarks, which they learned about from
reporters and television news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like swimming the English Channel with your feet tied,''
said one House Republican aide. ``It's a slap in the face of the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde left the meeting without speaking to reporters, but aides
said he was troubled by Lott's comments.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, the House managers were assigned specific
tasks for the trial. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin will
give the opening statement. James E. Rogan of California and Hyde
will give the closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Four managers were assigned to prepare for witnesses, George W.
Gekas of Pennsylvania, Steve Chabot of Ohio, Christopher Cannon of
Utah and McCollum. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Ed Bryant of
Tennessee and Rogan would question and cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Three managers would argue procedural motions, Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, Charles Canady of Florida and Buyer. Bob Barr of
Georgia and Sensenbrenner would deal with any evidentiary
objections.

EPA DILUTES ITS PAMPHLET ON PESTICIDES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from the food industry, the
Environmental Protection Agency has modified a new brochure about
pesticides, putting less emphasis on their health risks and barely
mentioning organic foods as an alternative to foods grown using
toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure, to be distributed in grocery stores under a food
safety law that Congress passed unanimously in 1996, was first
drafted about a year ago. Only a few pages long, it nonetheless was
hotly debated. Food industry groups called it unduly alarmist;
environmental and consumer advocacy groups complained that it did
not refer to pesticides as poisons.
</P>
<P>
   In August, seven food, farm and pesticide industry groups called
on the Clinton administration to eliminate any references to
organic foods and to make other changes.
</P>
<P>
   The final version of the pamphlet does not completely ignore
organic foods. It advises that ``your grocer may be able to provide
you with information about the availability of food grown using
fewer or no pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wording is a concession to industry groups, which had
complained about an earlier version. That version offered tips for
washing, peeling and cooking food to reduce pesticides, then added,
``If you are still concerned, consider buying food that says
`certified organic' _ food certified by a public or private
certification agency that has been grown in an area where fewer or
no man-made chemical pesticides were used.''
</P>
<P>
   A final draft of the pamphlet was provided to The New York Times
by Consumers Union, an advocacy group that publishes the magazine
Consumer Reports. The consumer group has long criticized the
environmental agency for not writing a tougher pamphlet to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, EPA took what could have been a really good
brochure and turned it into a propaganda piece for the food
industry, which has always denied that there is a problem with
pesticides on food,'' said Jeannine Kenney, a policy analyst in the
group's Washington office who said she obtained the pamphlet from a
government official.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials confirmed that the revised brochure was being
printed and said it should be in stores by January, five months
after the deadline set by the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very exhaustive consultations,'' said Loretta Ucelli, a
spokeswoman for the agency, ``and I think there are and have been
concerns about giving consumers the information they need, but not
causing alarm or indicating that food that is not organic is not
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we have arrived at aggressive but
consumer-friendly language that will give people the information
that they need to make their own choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, said the group continued to oppose the reworded pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the change in the language, it still promotes
organic foods in a brochure that was supposed to be about
pesticides,'' Grabowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest draft differs from earlier ones in several ways, most
of which seem to make less of the health risks of pesticide
residues on food.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier brochure, for example, was entitled ``Pesticides on
Food,'' but the new version is called ``Pesticides and Food.''
</P>
<P>
   The new version says that ``while pesticides have important
uses, studies show that some pesticides cause health problems at
certain levels of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   But it omits the details listed in the earlier version, which
said, ``Some pesticides have been shown to cause health problems
such as birth defects, nerve damage, cancer and other toxic effects
in laboratory animals.''
</P>
<P>
   And a section about washing, peeling and cooking food, which
used to be called ``Tips to Reduce Pesticides on Foods,'' is now
entitled ``Healthy, Sensible Food Practices.'' It emphasizes in
bold type the importance of eating at least five servings of fruits
and vegetables daily.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency plans to make more information
available on World Wide Web pages devoted to pesticides and food,
but the pages have not yet been posted on the Internet. Over the
objections of the industry, the Web address will be listed in the
brochure.

NELLIE MAE ROWE: THE ARTIST WHO DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (EDS: For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(rl) 
 By TESSA DE CARLO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During a lifetime of obsessive creativity, Nellie Mae
Rowe apparently gave little thought to her place in art history.
The hundreds of drawings and collages she made in her three-room
house in rural Vinings, Ga., the figures she fashioned out of old
stockings and chewing gum, and the densely decorated found-object
environment she created in her home and yard were to her simply an
intense and deeply satisfying form of play.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when visitors began coming to the place she called
Nellie's Playhouse asking to buy her pictures, Rowe was pleased to
learn she was an artist. ``I didn't even know that I would ever
come to be an artist,'' she told one interviewer. ``It is just
surprisin' to me.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, the Museum of American Folk Art in
Manhattan is presenting Rowe not only as an important 20th-century
artist but as one whose work bridges several categories in the
sometimes contentious world of folk, outsider and self-taught art.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Nellie Mae Rowe: Ninety-Nine-and-a-Half Won't Do'' (a
reference to one of the artist's favorite gospel hymns), the show
runs from Jan. 16 through May 16 and includes some 75 drawings and
sculptures. To underscore Rowe's multifaceted appeal, the museum
points out that the show's opening comes just in time for both the
Outsider Art Fair, which runs Jan. 22-24 at the Puck Building in
Manhattan, and the National Black Fine Art Show, taking place the
following weekend (Jan. 29-31) in the same SoHo location.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no argument that Rowe was African-American _ her
father was a former slave and her grandfather, according to family
lore, was born in Africa _ it's less clear whether she was a fine
artist, a folk artist or an outsider. Lee Kogan, director of the
museum's Folk Art Institute and curator of the exhibition, contends
that although these labels are often regarded as mutually
exclusive, Rowe's work comfortably fits them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her virtuosity and range of expression are diverse and broad
and elusive and very interesting,'' Ms. Kogan said in regard to
Rowe's fine-art credentials. ``She's an important artist who has
been underappreciated and deserves wider recognition.'' At the same
time, Ms. Kogan's essay in the richly illustrated exhibition
catalog offers an in-depth exploration of the myriad folk roots of
Rowe's work, ranging from possible African influences to explicit
references to gospel and Southern folklore.
</P>
<P>
   And although Rowe was, by all accounts, perfectly sane, Kogan
believes her work displays many of the classic characteristics of
outsider art, customarily defined as art created out of insanity,
isolation or extreme eccentricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie Mae Rowe created an alternate world, her playhouse,''
Ms. Kogan explained. ``She's obsessive _ she drew all the time,
constantly. Her expression shows a disregard for logical
constraints and is based on dreams, fantasies, imagination. We
don't use the term `outsider,' because of its negative
connotations, but she has many of those characteristics.''

 NEW YORK: those characteristics.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rowe was born in 1900 on a small farm outside Atlanta and died
82 years later in a town just a few miles away. She attended three
or four years of school but spent most of her childhood working on
the family farm. Whenever she could, she would sneak away to draw
and make dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me when she was a little girl she'd take the laundry,
the dirty stockings and socks, and tie them up and make dolls out
of them,'' said Joe Brown Sr., Rowe's 85-year-old nephew. ``Her
parents'd whup her. They didn't know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe married at 16 and worked most of her life as a domestic.
She never had children. After her second husband died, in 1948, she
began to adorn their small house and garden with Christmas
ornaments, plastic toys, stuffed animals, found junk and hundreds
of her own drawings and collages.
</P>
<P>
   She sewed eerily expressive dolls out of old stockings, with
yarn wigs and elaborate outfits. She pulled and kneaded her used
chewing gum into small, fierce figures that she hardened in her
freezer, then painted in bright colors. ``I'm back to a child
again,'' she explained in a taped interview in the 1970s. ``I've
worked all my days. Now I want to play these other days out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Rowe's neighbors probably regarded her as a little odd;
according to Brown, one or two called her ``an old hoodoo woman.''
But in the 1970s, art students and collectors of traditional folk
art began turning their attention to living artists and craftsmen
in the American countryside. What to others looked oddball to them
looked like art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a densely packed hodgepodge environment that would make
your mouth fall open,'' recalled Xenia Zed, a Georgia artist and
arts administrator who first saw Rowe's house in 1979. ``Everyone
from architects to the local deliveryman would stop and stare,
because it was an astounding creation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Rowe was taken up by the dealer Judith Alexander, who
in the 1950s opened the first gallery in Atlanta to show work by
Yves Kline, Mark Rothko and other abstract expressionists and who
two decades later opened the city's first gallery devoted to folk
art.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Ms. Alexander, Rowe earned enough money to live
comfortably in the final years of her life and gained access to
higher-quality materials. After 1978, small crayon and pencil
renderings, usually of single figures, sometimes of disembodied
hands or feet, gave way to densely colored pastel, crayon and
felt-tip pen drawings of fantastic plants, animals and human
figures intertwined with abstract shapes and quiltlike patterning.
</P>
<P>
   Her art was a sort of visual stream of consciousness.
``Whichever way my pencil turn, that's what I draw,'' Rowe told the
documentary filmmaker Linda Connelly Armstrong in the 1970s. ``I
may start drawing a flower, but if it come to me I put an eye up
over it or a nose or something and it's going to look like a
person, or I turn it over to a mule. I don't know what it is till I
finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe died of cancer in 1982, and her house was dismantled and
eventually torn down. A hotel stands on the site. The only record
of the outlandish, enchanting world she created is contained in a
few photographs, a short film by Ms. Armstrong that will be on view
as part of the exhibition, and the dolls and drawings that today
exist only as individual artworks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Folk Art Museum's executive director, Gerard
Wertkin, the Rowe exhibition underscores the importance of moving
beyond narrow definitions of ``folk'' and ``outsider'' in order to
do justice to some of the most interesting material by artists
working far outside the mainstream art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need institutions and individuals who will seek out and
study this work in order to bring it forward and have it
appreciated,'' he said. ``But there's a growing sense that `folk
art,' because of the term's emphasis on rootedness and deep
connection with tradition, is not appropriate for work that's
highly idiosyncratic. And `outsider' is hardly the word for work
that's created very much within the context of the artist's
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the museum's use of the term ``self-taught'' for the work
it will be gathering into its new Contemporary Center. A separate
division within the museum devoted to 20th-century work, the center
will embrace both contemporary folk art and outsider art. This
month the museum is expected to announce major gifts to the center
from museum trustees, running the gamut from American memory
paintings to the works of institutionalized European psychotics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona plans to announce on
Wednesday that he will form an exploratory committee to begin
soliciting money for a presidential bid, a move that his advisers
say makes it all but certain that he will seek the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the first in a wave of Republican candidates who will
signal their candidacies. His advisers said McCain was out of the
country on vacation and would announce his actual candidacy in
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain has for months openly toyed with running and has
traveled to early primary states like New Hampshire to gauge
reaction, his plans had not been as definite as those of several
other prospective contenders _ including Lamar Alexander, the
former Tennessee governor, and Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate
_ who have made no secret of their designs on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his advisers said McCain had been weighing whether he
wanted to endure scrutiny into his personal life; they said he
decided that the White House was probably worth the risk and
possible unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, who is co-chairman
of the McCain exploratory committee with Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona,
said McCain's ultimate candidacy ``is likely but is not a
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on the other candidates,'' Rudman
said, ``other than that I don't think any of them have the world
view and the tough, real world experience of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is 62 and has served in the Senate since 1987,
stands out from many other prospects because he has a reputation as
a consensus builder who reaches across party lines to champion
issues that are not always popular in his party such as the tobacco
bill and campaign finance legislation. But despite his conservative
bona fides and record as a foe of abortion, McCain's close
relationships with Democrats could cost him some support in his
party's primaries, which are dominated by hard-edged partisans.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters note that McCain has a most compelling personal
story: He was imprisoned for more than five years after his plane
was shot down in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe that the senator's biggest liability is
his lack of a national base to collect contributions. ``Obviously,
to be competitive, we need somewhere in the $15- to $20 million
dollar range,'' said John Weaver, a San Antonio strategist who was
political director of Sen. Phil Gramm's unsuccessful presidential
campaign in 1996; he plans to fill the same job for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest danger right now is the ability to raise the entry
fee money,'' said Scott Reed, who was the campaign manager for Bob
Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996. ``He does not have a natural
fund-raising base. He's not like Dole, who had a house file of
100,000 names.'' But, Reed said, McCain has ``the potential to be a
top-tier candidate'' because ``he has an interesting background of
foreign affairs, of cutting government pork and of populist
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers said the senator may not need as much money as
other contenders because he is nationally prominent and could draw
publicity because he is popular with reporters, who find him direct
and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our consensus, right or wrong, is he probably doesn't have to
raise as much as the other candidates because he is very well known
and he has a very distinctive record,'' Rudman said. ``And, the
truth is, members of the press have an admiration of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wanting to weigh how the issue could play in the
primaries, McCain has kept an uncharacteristically low profile in
the impeachment matter now before the Senate. He has not stated his
position about a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned down at least 500 _ maybe six or seven hundred
requests to go on talk shows on this issue,'' McCain said in an
interview several days ago. He said impeachment was the one issue
he did not want to touch, explaining, ``If it's Iraq I'm glad to
respond. I'm about as big a media hound as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's aides said one reason for their timing of McCain's
announcement was to upstage his rivals. Sen. John Ashcroft of
Missouri, for one, is expected on Tuesday to be the first
Republican to deliver his formal announcement of candidacy, in
Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has lined up several advisers for his expected bid: Greg
Stevens will be media consultant; Bill MacInturff, the pollster,
and Carla Eudy will be finance director, a post she held in the
Gramm campaign. Other advisers include Kenneth Duberstein and
Michael Deaver, veteran Republican insiders who had prominent posts
in the Reagan White House, and former Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota.
Howard Opinsky will be the spokesman, a job he held in the Gramm
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain was Gramm's national chairman in 1996, McCain's
advisers went out of their way to distance themselves from the
Gramm campaign. The Gramm drive had showed great promise and
fund-raising prowess in 1995 but quickly fizzled once the primaries
began. McCain's advisers contended that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who leads the Republican field in early polls, now had many
more ties to Gramm. ``The Lion's share of the Gramm people have
gone with George Bush,'' Opinsky said.

 &HT;    Texas Aggies head for Sugar Bowl
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They were a self-described ``bunch of old
country boys,'' those fightin' Texas Aggies from towns like Freer
and Brownwood, Hillsboro and Kerrville, who took New Orleans'
bright lights and big-city ways by storm 59 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday's Sugar Bowl game with Ohio State, the last time
Texas A&AMP;M went bowling in the Big Easy was on Jan. 1, 1940. The
stakes were higher that day, albeit less publicized. The Aggies
held off hometown favorite Tulane 14-13 before a record-setting
crowd of 73,000 in Tulane's own stadium to win A&AMP;M's first and only
national football championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, that's a big deal. But on the second day of 1940,
the Aggies learned of their accomplishment while riding the train
back to College Station after a robust night in the French Quarter
celebrating primarily an undefeated (11-0) 1939 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the sports publicity guys who traveled with us came
back through the train and said, 'Hey, did you know you're the
national champions?' `` recalled Howard Shelton, a reserve lineman
and unofficial team historian. ``We said, 'Oh, really? What's that
mean?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite an ending for some pretty illustrious careers for
some of our guys, but there was not all the hullabaloo that you
have now. There wasn't a ceremony or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was _ almost 59 years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred this past Oct. 10 when surviving members of the 1939
team and family members of deceased players finally received rings
commemorating their championship season. Twenty-four of the 66
members of the team are still living, and 19 attended the ceremony
held in conjunction with A&AMP;M's upset of second-ranked Nebraska. The
men are in their late 70s and early 80s now, but have vivid
memories of their date in the Sugar Bowl and appreciation for the
day in their honor in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest days of my life,'' said Austinite
Harold Cowley, a sophomore end in 1939 whose biggest athletic
moment would come later when he caught a 12-yard touchdown pass
against Alabama in the 1942 Cotton Bowl. ``It was nice to be
recognized like that and get those rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, much has changed since Jan. 1, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane's on-campus stadium, which had been enlarged shortly
before the game with A&AMP;M to accomodate the largest crowd ever to
see a football game in the south at that time, was razed after the
1974 season, replaced by student housing and a parking garage. The
Sugar Bowl now is played in the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt Hotel on Baronne Street, where the Aggies returned
after the game still in their uniforms, is now the Fairmont. One
thing hasn't changed, however. Swank Antoine's restaurant, where
the team gathered for a post-game victory meal, is still a major
attraction in the French Quarter and source of several humorous
Aggie memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had about seven or eight forks or spoons in front of us,
and we had no idea which one to use,'' said Roy Bucek, a lineman
and all-American hurdler in track who still lives in his hometown
of Schulenberg. ``We were all just poor, country boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Wimberly's Jim Thomason, a two-time all-Southwest
Conference halfback from Hillsboro: ``There were about 14 courses
and they gave you a little Schnapps or something between them.
After about the third one, you didn't care if you ate anything or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, who had spent the week before the game training in
seclusion on the Mississippi coast near Biloxi, felt they had the
right to do a little celebrating after completing only the third
undefeated, untied season in their history. The victory over Tulane
was just the second bowl appearance by the Ags _ A&AMP;M defeated
previously unbeaten Centre College 22-14 in the 1922 Dixie Classic
in Dallas that gave birth to the 12th Man legend _ and the Green
Wave represented one of the toughest challenges faced that season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Homer Norton's Aggies trailed Tulane 13-7 in the fourth
quarter. But All-American running back ``Jarrin''' John Kimbrough _
``the bull-shouldered . . . sturdy son of the Texas cow country,''
according to wire reports of the game _ gained 24 of his 159
rushing yards on his second touchdown run of the game to tie the
score. Then Thomason held for Cotton Price's game-winning
extra-point kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, we were glad to get that game over with,''
said Thomason, primarily a blocking back for Kimbrough but who went
on to earn All-American honors of his own in 1940. ``That was the
toughest game we'd ever played in. We were hurting all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was that unlike a few exceptions today,
players played both offense and defense. ``After a game, you felt
like you'd been run over by a Mack truck,'' said Charles Henke, who
owns a ranch between Fredericksburg and Kerrville.
</P>
<P>
   Henke, who attended Tivy High School in Kerrville, said the
Aggies were optimistic entering the 1939 season despite compiling
only a 4-4-1 mark the previous year. A&AMP;M relied primarily on a
tenacious defense that still holds the school record for fewest
average yards allowed per game (76.3).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M recorded six shutouts that season. Its closest shaves,
besides the Sugar Bowl, came at Santa Clara (7-3) and in the mud at
College Station in a 6-2 verdict over Southern Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't realize what we were doing,'' Henke said. ``But we
kind of got a little cocky after awhile. We felt we might be pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the championship team were juniors and returned
the next season to post a 9-1 record and a 13-12 victory over
Fordham in the Cotton Bowl. A&AMP;M's only loss was 7-0 at Texas, but
the Aggies also posted a 7-0 victory on the road against a UCLA
team led by Jackie Robinson, the first black player they had faced
in those days of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous players from the '39 team fought in World War II _ ``I
got my diploma in one hand and orders to report to Camp Wolters in
Mineral Wells in the other,'' said Henke, who fought in North
Africa and Italy _ and some never made it home. James ``Cotton''
Williams died in Europe on June 19, 1944, after being part of the
D-Day invasion. Derace ``Mose'' Moser and Herbie Smith both died in
1942 in separate crashes of their training planes .
</P>
<P>
   Thomason flew 65 combat missions in the Pacific as a B-25 pilot
before returning and playing one season with the Detroit Lions.
Bucek, an infantry captain, lost his left eye in the Battle of the
Bulge when struck by a piece of howitzer shrapnel that remains
lodged in his right cheek because surgery could cause facial
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football could be tough, but nothing was tougher than
combat,'' Bucek said. ``I'd never been through anything like that,
and never want to be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving members of the team still gather frequently and have
started holding annual reunions _ ``We're the 'meetingest' bunch
I've ever seen,'' Bucek said. Shelton, a retired bank president in
Fort Worth who attended Hillsboro High, is responsible for
organizing the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fellows seem to enjoy getting back together,'' said
Shelton. ``It's a good group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, 80, plans to attend this year's Sugar Bowl because one
of his two daughters, both of whom, ironically, graduated from
Tulane, lives in New Orleans and bought tickets to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too bad that we're not playing Tulane again,'' he
said. ``It could have been the rematch.''

 &HT;    Rainfall observers help gather rainfall totals
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Long before technology could monitor floods from
several hundred miles away, a crew of country folks kept an eye on
the Central Texas weather, warning their downstream neighbors when
the rain turned deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Rahe was one of the first to sign up, receiving a metal
rainfall collector in 1939 and instructions to telegraph if floods
knocked out the phones in his hometown of Harper, about 90 miles
west of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 years later, Rahe's rainfall collector is still in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie L. Rahe, his daughter-in-law, has kept the gauge since
1974, a year after Otto's death. Reluctant at first to assume the
family responsibility, Bonnie Rahe has faithfully recorded the
rainfall in her back yard for almost 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have to wade out there, but I can always get to it,''
said Rahe, 72. ``Though sometimes it's frozen up and I can't gauge
it. I have to bring it inside the house here and let it melt.''
</P>
<P>
   In this age of radio-operated river gauges, the information from
Rahe and about 100 other rainfall observers is no longer crucial to
the Lower Colorado River Authority. Still, every bit of data helps
during those first frantic hours as the LCRA struggles to determine
how bad a developing flood will be.
</P>
<P>
   Observers are supposed to call the LCRA when they receive two
inches of rain in 24 hours _ then call again for each additional
inch. Mostly, however, observers fill out a card and mail it at the
end of each month to help the LCRA develop precipitation standards
for different areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about 100 to 105 I can count on for a card most
months,'' said George Fears, senior hydrology technician for the
LCRA.
</P>
<P>
   When Otto Rahe joined the LCRA's rainfall observers, he helped
form the first flood early-warning system on the Colorado River.
Most observers were ranchers and residents of small towns, and the
foremost job qualification was owning a telephone, said Tom
Donaldson, an LCRA hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been glamorous work. Watching the weather often means
getting caught in it, and Bonnie Rahe has endured a few soggy
mornings in pursuit of her data.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it profitable work. Otto Rahe was promised $3.50 a year
and 50 cents for each telephone call to the LCRA. His
daughter-in-law can count on her annual check for $5 this January,
plus $2 per phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The pay is a bargain for the LCRA. Over the years, Bonnie Rahe
has been a dependable observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to do it. I've been sick a time or two,
but it never did rain then, so it didn't matter,'' she said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rahe gauge is in a particularly important site in Harper, a
small town in Gillespie County between Fredericksburg and Junction
Harper sits at the head of the Pedernales River, a flood-prone
waterway that empties into Lake Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Rahe, however, may be the last in her family to carry on the
tradition. ``There's no more family here in town,'' she said. ``And
they'll want someone here in town, I'm sure.''

BOEING REACHES GOAL OF DELIVERING 550 PLANES BY YEAR'S END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a miserable year marked by production troubles,
poor financial performance and a top management shakeup of its
commercial airplane business, The Boeing Co. finally came through
on a key promise and goal _ to deliver 550 airplanes by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement will be made Wednesday, followed by a
ceremony at the company's delivery center at Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing source said the 550th plane was delivered Tuesday, with
two days still left in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, this goal was very important for Boeing,''
said aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research. ``It won't do
anything to improve earnings, but the company said it would do
something and they did it. That's not been the case recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was able to reach its goal by significantly reducing the
number of airplanes in desert storage. As of Sept. 30, the end of
the third quarter, Boeing had 36 undelivered planes in the desert,
which was up from 20 in storage at the end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Undelivered planes are flown to airfields in the deserts of
California and Arizona for storage because the weather is ideal and
they will not deteriorate. Many of the 36 Boeing aircraft in desert
storage as of Sept. 30 were meant for Asian customers who could no
longer afford them, or no longer wanted them as fleets are reduced.
Boeing had to find new homes for those planes in order to meet its
year-end delivery goal.
</P>
<P>
   It did. Fewer than 10 airplanes will be sitting in the desert by
the end of the year, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people thought they would be able to find new owners
for those 36 airplanes,'' Nisbet said. ``It looked like a very
difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet credited Alan Mulally, Boeing's new commercial boss, for
making sure Boeing did not come up short of its delivery goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally replaced Ron Woodard, who was fired as head of the
commercial business at the end of August. Despite one of the
industry's biggest boom cycles ever, Boeing lost money for the
first time in a half century in 1997 and its production lines were
a mess as it attempted to crank up production to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered 374 planes last year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to reach its goal of delivering 550 planes this year,
Boeing had to deliver a record 182 planes in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Getting those final 182 planes out the factory door was so
critical that Mulally delayed from Nov. 2 until March the next
phase of Boeing's billion-dollar production overhaul that is
intended to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally wanted Boeing workers to focus exclusively on getting
airplanes delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to miss that delivery goal, and it's great
that he didn't,'' Nisbet said of Mulally.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing reached its delivery goal for 1998, an
indication that the company's production difficulties may be over,
Boeing must still improve its financial performance, Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those 550 planes were delivered with no profit,'' Nisbet said.
``If there is a pleasant surprise to the contrary, then I'd be
surprised. But the important thing is they did what they promised
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally said last week that Boeing still plans to produce a
record 620 airplanes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing now faces an economic industry downturn. The company
plans to slash its work force by 48,000 over the next two years.
Many of those job losses will come from its commercial business in
the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has told industry analysts it will take a couple
of years before its commercial airplane profit margins improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Mulally can pull a rabbit out of his hat and make
that happen more quickly,'' Nisbet said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Flash floods can rip 60-foot trees out of the
ground, turn boulders into battering rams and scrape homes off
their foundations, scattering tornado-like devastation over dozens
of square miles.
</P>
<P>
   And no place in the United States is more prone to flash floods
than the Hill Country west of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Starting around Junction, about 140 miles west of Austin, water
quickly collects into the Llano River and tumbles toward the
Colorado River, reaching speeds up to 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's always hanging over our heads here,'' said Tom
Donaldson, a Lower Colorado River Authority hydrologist. ``In the
Hill Country, everything can happen so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   With only hours to warn the growing number of people living
along the rivers and lakes of Central Texas, including Lake Travis,
the LCRA is taking steps to improve its weather eyes and ears.
Beginning in January, the river authority will begin a $7.2 million
program to more than double the number of rainfall monitors and
flood gauges on rivers and creeks.
</P>
<P>
   The extra data won't change how the LCRA opens and closes
floodgates on its dams; that will still depend on federal rules
that weigh rising lake elevations against the risk of downstream
flooding. The goal is faster, better information so flood-plain
residents can flee a deluge or prepare their homes for minor
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lead time is always nice,'' said Wes Birdwell, hydrology
manager for the LCRA. ``It's not going to change the number of
people who get flooded,'' but it could save lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA estimates 30,000 houses are within 500 feet of the six
Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and
Austin. Most of those homes were built in the past 20 years, and
many are in the flood plains, putting thousands of families at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of development on this river and around these
lakes. A lot of lives get interrupted,'' Birdwell said. ``When
there were just a few fishing cabins on Lake Travis, who cared how
far the lake came up?''
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA has 75 gauges already in place. Over the next five
years, 80 new rain gauges will be installed to measure how much
water to expect in nearby rivers and creeks. Another 21 river
gauges will verify those projections, providing better information
about how high water will rise in lakes and rivers downstream.
</P>
<P>
   A second phase envisions 40 more gauges that will fill any gaps
found after the first round of construction. The cost of phase two
has not been determined, said Ann Boulden, project manager.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the gauges will be upstream of Austin in
the Hill Country, rated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as
having, along with portions of Southern California and northwest
Arizona, the highest potential for flash flooding in the nation
</P>
<P>
   The first $4.5 million for the expanded system was allocated in
June, well before this fall's flooding reinforced the grave need
for better information.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall in the Hill Country was minimal; most local flooding
occurred in a band from Austin and San Marcos to Seguin. But if the
October storm system had shifted 85 miles to the northwest, the
results would have been devastating, LCRA estimates show.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Travis would have risen at least 50 feet, and Town Lake
could have surged over the bridges at Lamar Boulevard, South First
Street and Congress Avenue in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In Bastrop, the Colorado River would have crested 25 feet higher
than during the October floods, likely flooding the downtown. Lake
LBJ would have received three times more water than during June
1997, the worst flood in the lake's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that (damage estimate) _ it scared the hell out of me,''
Donaldson said. ``It still gives me chills, just thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Highland Lakes have survived other close calls, including
the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley, which missed the Colorado
River basin by 20 miles and produced floods that killed ninein Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, it's only a matter of time before a catastrophic
flood hits the Hill Country. When it happens, the first line of
defense will be the Hydromet, the LCRA's system of river and
rainfall gauges. The oldest gauges were installed in the early
1980s, and all 75 of the current gauges were replaced or modernized
by early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded Hydromet, covering a much wider territory, will add
80 weather sites and 21 gauges to measure how much water is flowing
in rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the weather sites will measure only rainfall and
temperature and cost $15,000 apiece. The rest also will measure
humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and evaporation and will cost
$20,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   River gauges cost $25,000 and use a deceptively simple way to
measure water depth _ blowing bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   A thick, flexible tube is attached to a fixed point underwater,
usually on a concrete pier that supports a bridge. Deeper water
puts greater pressure on the nozzle, making it harder to push
bubbles through the tube. Measuring the subtle change provides an
accurate count of the water's depth, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-foot-by-3-foot box, usually fixed to the bridge above street
level, contains the river gauge equipment and antennas.
</P>
<P>
   River gauges use electricity, but most weather sites use solar
power because of their remote locations. All sites can operate for
two to three days on rechargeable batteries, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   Data is transmitted on the LCRA's 900-megahertz radio system.
``Anytime we want data, we can go get it,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   Information also can be sent by telephone or radio as a backup.
As a last resort, particularly if flood debris damages a river
gauge, the LCRA sends employees to make visual reports.
</P>
<P>
   No LCRA gauges were damaged in the October floods, but water
reached the bottom of two equipment boxes. Both have been moved to
higher ground, Donaldson said.

IRAQ VOWS TO DEFY U.S. BAN AND FLY IN `NO FLIGHT' ZONES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraq defiantly vowed Tuesday to fly over the large
swaths of the country where the United States and its allies bar
its flights. But the Pentagon said Iraq had not yet provoked a
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   A day after U.S. jets attacked an anti-aircraft battery in
northern Iraq when they came under fire, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said his air force would fly at will in the ``no
flight'' zones created by the United States and its allies in
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   There were sketchy reports early Tuesday that Iraqi helicopters
had entered the restricted zones, but U.S. officials later said
they had not spotted any violations by Iraqi aircraft, despite
intensifying oratory from President Saddam Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan called the U.S.-led patrols of the zones a violation of
Iraq's sovereignty and threatened to try again to shoot down U.S.
or British aircraft flying over Iraq. ``The so-called air exclusion
zones exist only in the sick imagination of the British and
American administrations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States suspended patrols over northern Iraq on
Tuesday, but the Pentagon said that was a routine decision made
because of thunderstorms and not a response to the exchange of
missile fire with Iraqi forces Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The patrols continued in the southern zone, and the Clinton
administration insisted that it would not ease enforcement in
either zone, calling the restrictions an important part of the
strategy to contain Saddam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the skirmish in the northern zone Monday, an Iraqi air
defense battery fired three surface-to-air missiles at a patrol of
U.S. aircraft that included F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and EA-6B
communications-jamming jets that are also armed with radar-seeking
missiles, according to the Pentagon's account.
</P>
<P>
   The jets, which patrol the zone from a base in Incirlik, Turkey,
then counterattacked, the account said. The commander of the jets
in Turkey, Brig. Gen. David Deptula of the Air Force, Tuesday day
released videotape that he said confirmed the Pentagon's account
that Iraq had fired first. Baghdad has contended that it launched
surface-to-air missiles in self-defense after an American attack
began.
</P>
<P>
   One of the videos showed what the Pentagon officials said was
the Iraqi missile launching before the U.S. response.
</P>
<P>
   The others showed three F-15Es striking the Iraqi site with six
500-pound, laser-guided bombs, evidently destroying the battery's
radar, optical guidance unit and a van that served as the command
center for the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The video showed additional explosions after the initial
strikes, a Pentagon official said, suggesting that the attack
destroyed at least some Iraqi missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth F-15E also tried to attack the site but was unable to
identify the target with its sensors, the official said, probably
because the target had already been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials played down the significance of the latest
incident and Iraqi statements and said there was no need to bolster
forces in the region or to change tactics. ``Today was no different
than yesterday or last week,'' said Maj. Joseph LaMarca, a
spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces
in the region from its headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also minimized the threat posed by Iraq's air
force. It is estimated to have more than 300 fighter jets and
helicopters, but no more than half are in condition to fly,
military analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has sophisticated Soviet-era MiG fighters and French
Mirages, among others, but its air force took a beating in the
Persian Gulf war of 1991 and has suffered under United Nations
sanctions. Iraqi officials have been able to smuggle in spare parts
from Russia, though.
</P>
<P>
   Although the surface-to-air missile attack was the first against
U.S. planes over Iraq since September 1996, the officials said
Baghdad had repeatedly _ and ineffectually _ tested the enforcement
of the no-flight zones in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials say they expect Saddam's forces to
continue to play a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. and British
jets that patrol the zones.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why Saddam's seems determined to provoke new
confrontations after the U.S. and British strikes against 100
military and industrial targets in his country earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials speculate that Iraq hopes that new clashes will erode
international support for maintaining sanctions and enforcing the
no-flight zones. The zones were created in 1991 in the north and a
year later in the south to protect ethnic and religious groups
facing repression from Saddam's forces.
</P>
<P>
   By firing at planes operating in the northern zone, Iraq put
pressure on Turkey, whose government warily permits U.S. and
British jets to use the base in Incirlik, though with restrictions
on the number of combat jets. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin
called Tuesday for ``the use of the base with sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of the U.S. and British strikes on Iraq this
month, French jets stopped patrolling the southern zone. France
withdrew from taking part in enforcement of the northern zone in
1996 after a previous attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Saddam's government has been unable to rally support, even
in the Arab world, where reaction to the U.S. and British raids has
been divided. Iraq traded sharp words with Egypt, where President
Hosni Mubarak has blamed Saddam for the suffering of Iraq's people.
On Monday the Arab League postponed for a month a meeting that had
been set this week to discuss the attacks on Iraq.

WATERY BALLET, POTENT MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For release on Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(rl) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No composer since World War II has been more resistant to
pigeonholing than Hans Werner Henze. At 72, Henze is still a force
in European modernism. Yet his life's work can be seen as an
attempt to revitalize classical forms and genres _ sonata, concerto
and symphony, theme and variations, and especially opera _ through
cutting-edge innovation.
</P>
<P>
   His early works, remarkably assured for a composer who came
relatively late to music, were steeped in the polytonal techniques
of Hindemith and the neoclassical aesthetic of Stravinsky. Then, in
the late 1940s, he attended the annual classes offered by Rene
Leibowitz in Darmstadt, Germany, which soon became a hotbed of
12-tone radicalism. Henze was among the first composers of his
generation to adopt serialism, and among the first to abandon it
for freer procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Henze's national identity is complex. Born in Westphalia, the
eldest of six children of a high-minded schoolteacher, Henze had a
thorough German middle-class education, and played piano and
percussion in a local music-school orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, at 18, he was drafted into the army, spending most of
his time in a unit that made propaganda films. He served a brief
spell as a prisoner of war under the British. But the Nazi taint
never took, for from his early adulthood, Henze was a powerful
intellectual with avowed leftist leanings; after the war, he was an
outspoken critic of his country, which he left in 1953 to take up
residence in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have heard works by Henze should not assume that they
know him. Take his three-act ballet ``Undine,'' which has just been
released in its first recording, with Oliver Knussen conducting the
London Sinfonietta (Deutsche Grammophon 453 467-2; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   This enthralling work, commissioned by the choreographer
Frederick Ashton for the Royal Ballet of London and completed when
Henze was just 31, is a lush, rhapsodic homage to the 19th-century
romantic ballet. Yet with its audacious mixing of styles and its
rigorous compositional procedures, it could not be more fresh and
modern.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet, which was adapted from a fairy tale by Friedrich de
La Motte-Fouque and had its premiere in 1958, was one of Ashton's
most ambitious works. It was also a milestone in the career of
Margot Fonteyn, who created the title role of the water nymph,
fatally loved by a mortal, an inconstant young prince named
Palemon. Ashton's ballet has been revived only occasionally, and
until now, few besides those acquainted with the ballet have had a
chance to hear Henze's score.
</P>
<P>
   Why has ``Undine'' languished, when so many ballet scores by
Stravinsky and other composers have entered the concert repertory?
The neglect may simply have to do with the work's length. Most of
Stravinsky's ballets run less than 30 minutes, and even longer
scores, like ``Le Sacre du Printemps,'' occupy just half of a
typical symphony program. ``Undine'' lasts about one hour 40
minutes, a length that, as Knussen writes in his liner notes, has
perhaps doomed it to ``a restricted life beneath the dancers' feet
in the orchestra pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the score's neglect, Knussen suggests, was
its mixed initial reception. The music's roots in early German
romanticism and the neoclassicism of Stravinsky ``automatically
made it anathema to the avant-garde of the 1950s,'' Knussen writes.
On the other hand, Henze's ``absorption of aspects of Schoenbergian
practice into his musical language'' probably made the score ``an
adventurous listen'' for traditional ballet audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Although the musical synthesis of historic models and new
practices that Henze achieved in this work in 1957 anticipated the
current fashion for rich tonality and lyricism, his edgy, daring
music makes many neo-romantic works by younger composers today seem
tepid and safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief opening episode, Henze evokes the dangerously
mingling worlds of Palemon and his courtiers, and Tirrenio, the
king of the waters and Ondine's father. Quiet sustained chords in
the high winds, beguiling yet pungent with dissonance, hover over
ominously meandering lines in the low strings, as fragments of
folkloric tunes and a hint of hunting horns sound.
</P>
<P>
   In the first full scene, when hunters and guests gather at
Palemon's castle for his wedding to Beatrice, the driving rhythms
and brassy fanfares recall in spirit the fairy-tale operas of
German romanticism: Imagine Carl Maria von Weber as a 1950s
modernist.
</P>
<P>
   A ruminative solo dance for Palemon, with its restless clarinet
line and gently fractured accompanimental patter, reveals the young
knight's restless inner life. Then, in an ethereal passage, Ondine
emerges briefly from the water world, and Palemon, entranced, tries
to pursue her. Tirrenio intervenes, but the mortal and the nymph
will not be denied, and they run off and find a hermit to marry
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the pivotal scene of the second act, Beatrice catches up with
the man who betrayed her and his nymph bride, who are about to
embark in a boat manned by sailors. Beatrice confronts the
newlyweds, and in the confusion they allow her to join them.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat sails, the music sways atop a lolling, fateful
four-note bass figure; an upper voice spins a melodic line of
Bergian contours for solo violin. Tirrenio conjures up a violent
storm, with slashing orchestral chords, which returns Ondine to
him. In despair, Palemon again agrees to marry Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   But the wedding is ill-fated, as the extended party scene in Act
III makes clear. Tirrenio and his followers, all masked, show up at
the festivities, which are inaugurated with an exuberant
``wrong-note'' brass fanfare. This is soon followed by a muted
Adagio for horns, like some somber chorale, with a reflective,
every-which-way line for solo flute providing quizzical commentary
after each verse.
</P>
<P>
   The party is interrupted by a wild, extended Divertissement: an
ecstatic series of dances and variations, scored for clattering
winds, raucous strings and frenetic piano, with neoclassical
counterpoint and spiraling passage work run amok.
</P>
<P>
   The music is unhinged and jazzy, like some Prokofiev concerto
for honky-tonk piano. Peter Donohoe, the piano soloist, plays with
unflagging energy and impressive clarity. By the end of the work,
Palemon tries again to return to Ondine, but on kissing her, he
falls dead. As the sea engulfs the castle, Ondine is slowly
enveloped by watery depths and tremulously sustained orchestral
chords.
</P>
<P>
   Though not employing full orchestral forces, the instrumentation
is remarkably rich and strikingly colored. Knussen conducts with
the keen understanding, character and command of a composer with a
demonstrated gift for theatrical music. The playing of the London
Sinfonietta is scintillating. The recorded sound is clear and
present; the liner notes are extensive and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Knussen writes that during recording sessions, the orchestral
musicians crowded into the playback room to hear the results. In
more than 15 years of studio recording, he adds, he had never
experienced ``such collective enthusiasm, involvement and sense of
`discovering' something very special indeed.''

 Snaring Startup Capital  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
David Pruitt thought he had a great idea for a new company when he
and Beverly Stewart started 5 Star Medical Inc. four years ago to
make minimally invasive surgery even less invasive with their
skinny fiber-optic endoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   But launching the Hayward company has taken a lot longer, and a
lot more money than Pruitt and Stewart, now his wife, ever
imagined. Like many budding entrepreneurs, they were short on
capital and experience in starting a business but long on
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart sold her house and other property to finance the
business. It also took much longer than the expected six months to
design his medical device. And Pruitt now figures it will take
about 10 times his initial $100,000 estimate to make it a
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Pruitt, 59, who spent most of his career
selling other manufacturers' medical products, has learned some
important lessons. These include turning to experts, developing a
financial plan early and being willing to swap a big chunk of the
company for outside capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Pruitt called the Corporation for Manufacturing
Excellence (Manex), a Fremont nonprofit organization that counsels
small manufacturers on how to grow their businesses. For a deferred
consulting fee, Manex helped 5 Star prepare documents required by
prospective investors and even walked Pruitt through the process of
making a proper business presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many cash-starved startups, 5 Star Medical has a
promising product line and sales of about $250,000 a year. One of
its endoscopes, with a catheter as slim as a pencil lead, has been
bought by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to peer
into turbine assemblies and by university veterinary researchers to
gaze into cat bladders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Despite making five or six endoscopes a month, the company is
still losing money. To become a commercial success, Pruitt figures
he needs to invest heavily in product development and marketing. He
hopes to land $750,000 from a private investor in the next few
weeks and is ready to give up 25 percent or more of the company to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Planning
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs need to go after capital the way they go after
customers, advises Manex Vice President Robert Johnson. ``They need
a plan,'' he says. ``What usually happens is they go through their
personal cash, their credit cards and friends and family and then
they raise their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Manex, which is subsidized by federal and state agencies,
counsels small manufacturers on production techniques, technology
applications and business practices, including raising capital.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs with a pedigree and a track record who seek $4
million or $40 million may have a good chance tapping a venture
capital fund, which funnels pension and other institutional money
into promising startups. ``But we're usually not dealing with
companies that fit the requirements of &UR;  &LR; venture capitalists on
Sandhill Road,'' says Johnson. ``If you're looking for $250,000 to
$1 million, then creativity comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you can expect anyone else to invest in your dream, you
better demonstrate your own commitment by putting yourself at risk,
advises David Evanson, author of ``Where to go When the Bank Says
No,'' (Bloomberg Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   That means borrowing against your savings, your credit cards,
your mortgage or even your 401(k) retirement plan. You might also
go to family and friends before hitting up strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical entrepreneur often goes to the bank first, when
the better strategy is to look for equity financing,'' said
Evanson. ``Equity investors share in the growing value of the
company.'' In addition to venture capital and initial public
offerings, other sources of capital include wealthy private
investors, often called angels.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``knowing where to go is only part of the equation,''
says Evanson. ``Equally important is knowing how to effectively
approach a potential investor.'' That involves developing a
persuasive business plan and preparing credible historical and
projected financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses that don't want to give up a piece of the
ownership, can seek community loan development funds or, if they
have revenues, might use royalty or accounts receivable financing.
</P>
<P>
   Local Programs
</P>
<P>
   There are several Bay Area organizations that help entrepreneurs
plan their businesses and raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area Regional Technology alliance in Fremont helps young
companies develop new technology products and services and find
financial support. With BARTA's help, companies applying for
federal R&AMP;D funds can get additional matching grants from the
California Technology Investment Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, BARTA has backed about three dozen
Bay Area businesses and distributes about $2 million a year.
Executive Director Alexander Glass says only about one in four
applicants receive nonrefundable grants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Winners have included businesses striving to make new
therapeutic agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis, new types of flat
panel displays and a process for integrating solar cells in roofing
tiles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, BARTA operates in Northern California the Small
Business Administration's Angel Capital Electronic Network
(ACE-Net), which links entrepreneurial companies with potential
individual investors over the Internet. It is estimated that
250,000 angel investors in the United States currently pour more
than $20 billion a year into 30,000 ventures.
</P>
<P>
   BARTA also sponsors investor forums where companies present
their business plans to accredited investors. On February 10 and
11, for example, BARTA will co-sponsor a conference in San
Francisco spotlighting companies that develop environmental
technologies to reduce industrial waste, pollution and energy use.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization that helps local entrepreneurs is the
California Statewide Communities Development Authority. The Walnut
Creek state-supported agency has issued more than $6 billion in
tax-exempt financings since 1987 and has lent some of the money to
small manufacturing companies that can support debt service
payments despite having few assets.
</P>
<P>
   This year it lent about $15 million at attractive 5.5 percent to
6.75 percent interest rates to a dozen local companies for
equipment purchases. It also loans money at slightly higher rates
to select operating companies for land acquisition and building
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Lending Initiatives
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous for-profit organizations also trying to get
small businesses off the ground. One of the largest is the
California Economic Development Lending Initiative, which was
started in 1995 and is supported by 47 banks and other companies.
It loans from $50,000 to $250,000 from a $65 million pool to deal
with ``unmet credit needs, especially of minorities and women,''
says CEDLI President George Williamson.''
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary is Everett &AMP; Jones Barbecue, which plans to open
in Oakland's Jack London Square in two weeks. The new restaurant
got a five-year loan of $150,000 from CEDLI and another $150,000
from the California Career Bank in Los Angeles for 10 percent
annual interest. ``In addition to being really helpful with
financing,'' says restaurant President Dorothy King, ``they
provided construction management to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Internet sites help small businesses check
out financial alternatives or even get a loan. GetSmart, a
2-year-old Burlingame company, expanded last summer its online
offerings from consumer borrowing to small-business lending
options.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 million businesses in the United States with $250
billion in outstanding loans, so it's a big market, according to
GetSmart. ``The average small business typically takes three months
to find financing that meets their needs,'' said CEO Bill Fisher.
``We can find them an ideal match in minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business owners who provide information about their
business, credit history and financing preferences _ such as
conventional bank loan, equipment loan, accounts receivable
financing or corporate credit card _ get matches with potential
lenders, but not loan guarantees. The Web site is
 &LR; www.getsmart.com &LR;  and the company's investors include Reuters,
Goldman Sachs and Robertson Stephens Group.

GIANTS CONTEMPLATE PERSONNEL PLANS FOR 1999  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like a quarterback debate to monopolize the
off-season dialogue. The Kent Graham-Danny Kanell saga should have
a considerable shelf life, but unfortunately for the Giants, there
are vexing personnel decisions to be made all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   Right up the middle of the defense, for example, linebacker
Corey Widmer is an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind Widmer, the Giants would probably like to find a
way to replace free safety Tito Wooten with Shaun Williams. But
what happens if the team's only other free safety, Percy Ellsworth,
who is a restricted free agent, draws a contract offer the Giants
can't or don't care to match?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that gifted Giants quartet, the Four
Cornerbacks. Phillippi Sparks, Jason Sehorn, Conrad Hamilton and
Carleton Gray all want to start. Only two can.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, two starting offensive linemen (Greg Bishop and
Lance Scott) are unrestricted free agents and a third, tackle Roman
Oben, is a restricted free agent, which means the Giants can match
any offer he receives, as with Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Amani Toomer is a restricted free agent, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got my job, there is no greater misnomer than the
off season,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi was already helping prepare the Giants for the expansion
dispersal draft, which will help stock the Cleveland Browns roster.
The Giants will have to expose five players with the chance of
losing two. It's not just a place to deposit your scrubs, it might
be a chance to dump an unwanted high-salaried player.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' coaches and executives will meet next week to plot
strategies. By mid-February the new salary cap figure will be
announced, and with more money to spend, the pursuit of free-agent
players will begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about setting priorities,'' Coach Jim Fassel said Monday.
``That's the first thing you do in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants have seven restricted free agents, Oben and
Toomer are the priorities in that group. Toomer showed the value of
a tall receiver this season, and his vast improvement _ along with
the potential exhibited by the underused rookies Joe Jurevicius and
Brian Alford _ means the Giants finally view their receiving corps
as adequate, or even a potential strength.
</P>
<P>
   It has been years since anyone said that.
</P>
<P>
   Oben is in the prototypical quick-footed left tackle mold. Teams
can tender their restricted free agents at various levels, which
set prospective, one-year salary levels and the compensation a
competing team would have to pay if it lured the player away.
Expect Oben to be tendered by the Giants at a high level, which
would mean a potential suitor would have to give the Giants at
least a first-round pick _ major compensation _ for signing Oben.
</P>
<P>
   Of the unrestricted free agents, Widmer is expected back and may
even agree to terms before testing the open market. Defensive end
Chad Bratzke, who had a breakout year in 1998, seems destined for
the big free-agent sweepstakes. Fassel said he wanted to keep both
Widmer and Bratzke.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, another free agent, doesn't figure in the Giants' plans
and since center Brian Williams is coming back from his eye
problems, the current starting center Lance Scott, who is also a
free agent, may find he can get more money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have an overloaded secondary. Hamilton, a restricted
free agent who surprised even his supporters with his determined
and reliable play in place of Sehorn this year, should be brought
back as the third cornerback to starters Sehorn and Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   That probably leaves Gray as the odd man out. He said Monday he
didn't want to return to the Giants unless guaranteed a chance to
compete for a starting job. Of course, Hamilton said the same
thing, but he doesn't have the leverage Gray does.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has a big 1999 salary cap number ($2.25 million) and the
Giants agreed to help him find another team if he was unhappy as a
Giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Garnes is the strong safety and the grand plan is get
Williams, the Giants' top pick in 1997, into the mix at free
safety. Wooten, earning $2 million annually, had a dreadful season.
Wooten would be a natural for the Giants' expansion list since
Ellsworth is the better investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellsworth has gaudy interception numbers for a player who
doesn't start _ 12 in three seasons _ and they may entice another
team to offer him a big contract offer. Given their other pressing
needs, the Giants may not chase Ellsworth, so maybe Wooten
survives.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Giants are going to be looking hard at finding a
pass-catching tight end. They will need a guard to replace Bishop,
unless right tackle Scott Gragg switches to guard, which has been
discussed by the Giants coaches. That would mean the Giants either
promote the rookie Toby Myles, who has no NFL experience, to right
tackle or draft a right tackle, or sign one during free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The strongside linebacker Marcus Buckley needs help on first
down against the run, so the Giants may be in the market for a
linebacker who can do just that, which is what Corey Miller did for
the Giants in 1997. But don't expect Miller back. Miller's neck
injury may not be career-threatening after all and he may play
again next season, but the Giants coaches don't want Miller back.
</P>
<P>
   Miller can compare notes with running back Tyrone Wheatley. We
may never know what Fassel didn't like about Tyrone as a player,
but by this spring it shouldn't matter because Wheatley will be
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants expect running back LeShon Johnson _ it was diagnosed
that he had lymphoma last spring _ to rejoin the team by the team's
first minicamp May 11. Don't be surprised if Johnson is not the
only new Giants running back in that camp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire Giants backfield should be crowded since
there could be another quarterback in there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Can't have enough quarterbacks _ or enough of that quarterback
controversy.

SPORTS COLUMN: NFL PUTS NEW FACES INTO THE MIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While an unprecedented five National Football League head
coaches were getting pink slips on Monday _ the biggest day of
firings this side of George Steinbrenner on a bad day _ the Giants'
defensive coordinator, John Fox, and defensive backs coach, Johnnie
Lynn, had their best suits on and were staring into a camera. And
they weren't making home movies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lynn were taking part in a groundbreaking project that
several years from now could change the face of professional
football. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has begun a program in which
an independent consulting company is videotaping interviews of a
select group of 20 to 30 assistant coaches, most of them black, who
have been recommended by individual teams as having high potential
to become head coaches and coordinators. Those taped interviews are
to serve as a coaching database; the idea is to introduce owners
and executives to new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former defensive coordinator for the Oakland Raiders, is
white, and Lynn, who was defensive backs coach for San Francisco
and Tampa Bay and played eight years as a defensive back for the
Jets, is black. They were among the first coaches to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is basically a living resume, and very professional,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it tough to tape such an interview the same day five coaches
were fired?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough because a lot of those guys are my
friends,'' Fox said. ``But that is the business we're in. The time
a coach has to turn things around is getting shorter and shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners from Philadelphia, Carolina, Baltimore, Seattle and
Chicago fired their coaches. June Jones resigned from San Diego to
coach at the University of Hawaii, and the expansion Cleveland
Browns are looking for a head coach, so in all, there are seven
positions open, and by the end of the month, there could be more.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear about the usual suspects to replace them. There
will be the hot coordinator, like Minnesota's offensive
coordinator, Brian Billick, who interviewed with the Browns on
Monday; Denver's offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, who visited
Cleveland on Tuesday; Pittsburgh's defensive coordinator, Jim
Haslett, and the Jets' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick. The
can't-miss college coach, like Florida's Steve Spurrier. The sexy
head coach who wants more power, like Green Bay's Mike Holmgren.
And retreads, retreads, retreads. Former San Francisco coach George
Seifert, the failed television analyst who has not coached in two
years, interviewed with the Panthers on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There are few fresh faces here.
</P>
<P>
   And no black ones.
</P>
<P>
   If black head coaches are shut out this round, as they have been
since Tampa Bay hired Tony Dungy after the 1995 season despite
dozens of openings since then, it would be one of the sorriest
travesties in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, black coaches may not sit silently by and watch
while their white counterparts _ some with less experience _ pass
them by. There is again talk among some black assistant coaches of
a possible discrimination lawsuit against the NFL, or joining
forces with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   So Tagliabue is taking a major step to correct the problem with
this program, coordinated by George Young, the former Giants
general manager, who is now a league vice president. Tagliabue has
a sincere desire to fix a terrible predicament, but he is also not
a fool.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a major embarrassment to his league, and leaves the
NFL liable in the court of public opinion and maybe even in a court
of law.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative by Tagliabue is a smart one because it brings
more blacks into the coaching soup. But also, by assembling this
database, it discreetly counters a ploy that owners and general
managers have used for years. The common refrain is that there are
not enough qualified blacks to fill head coaching and coordinator
positions. Yet the database is full of top candidates the teams
themselves have recommended. So any talk now of a lack of qualified
blacks is a hollow excuse.
</P>
<P>
   There will be problems. Already, some white assistant coaches
are privately complaining about preferential treatment for blacks.
There are also going to be awkward situations because some members
of a staff are going to take part in the program while others are
not. Tagliabue has had to walk a fine line in other ways: push
owners too hard, or go public, and they become resentful of him.
</P>
<P>
   Black coaches, despite Tagliabue's efforts, could still be shut
out this time. But Tagliabue's idea is the best the NFL has
developed to combat this situation.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? That's up to the owners.

NEUTRALITY IN ELECTION VOWED FOR INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to add 4 grafs at end) (bl) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The head of Indonesia's armed forces has
pledged that the military will be neutral and not try to influence
national elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces' chief, Gen. Wiranto, said the military, which
has played a crucial role in Indonesia's politics, would ``keep an
equal distance to anyone,'' including the governing Golkar party as
well as opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday after meeting with President B.J.
Habibie, he said the military's main role would be to safeguard
security for all political parties to contest the first free
elections since the end of former President Suharto's 32-year
dictatorial rule in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiranto reaffirmed an earlier promise to form a
40,000-strong civilian militia to help keep law and order before
the elections June 7. Voters are to elect a 550-seat House of
Representatives. The election is to be followed in August by a
meeting of the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, which
will choose a new president.
</P>
<P>
   When Wiranto first made the militia proposal this month,
students held street protests, saying the militia could be easily
be transformed into a vigilante group to support the governing
party. Diplomats and military analysts based in Jakarta have also
expressed reservations about the quality of recruits and short
training period for the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the potential for violence during the months
preceding the elections, Wiranto said he hoped there would be
little conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is based on law and the law must be upheld both by
the government and the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the start of the Moslem Holy month of Ramadan last
week, university students were holding almost daily demonstrations
in the capital to press their demands for speedier political
reforms and an end to the military's dual economic and political
role.

A LONG GOODBYE, WITH MUCH ACCOMPANIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa.)  (EDS: For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(rl) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Russell Davies is about to give up the music directorship
of the American Composers Orchestra, a contemporary-music ensemble
he helped found in 1975. But his formal parting will be as
protracted as a diva's farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   His final project as music director, ``20th-Century Snapshots,''
a series of 11 thematic concerts, begins next Sunday with ``The
Gershwin Circle'' and ends in 2001. A survey of Cuban works in
March and a program of Walt Whitman settings in May round out the
first season.
</P>
<P>
   These programs and the others Davies has outlined for the next
two seasons _ ``Protest,'' ``Roots,'' ``Lindbergh,''
``Copland-Sessions,'' ``Pacifica,'' ``Ellis Island to JFK,''
``Berlin, 1931'' and ``Hollywood'' _ describe both a large
repertory and a vast historical backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do was to think about the United States, the
century we're leaving and what some of the broad themes were,''
Davies said. ``So `Hollywood,' `Pacifica,' `Lindbergh,' these were
evocative themes that are both very American and very
international.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the series ends, is it curtains for Davies'
relationship with the orchestra? Hardly. He hopes to take this
ensemble of New York freelancers, and the 11 ``Snapshots''
programs, on tour. He will also return to lead it regularly as
conductor laureate, and will join the orchestra's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has typically conducted three of the five concerts the
orchestra plays in a season,'' said Michael Geller, executive
director of the American Composers Orchestra. ``But with this
series, we'll have him for 11 programs in a row, so it turns out
that now that he's leaving, we'll have more of him than we've had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include Davies' appearances with the orchestra
in Carnegie Hall children's concerts in June. Indulging a penchant
for mixing old and new that goes back to his days as music director
of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in the mid-1970s and principal
conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic in the early '90s, he will
offer the children programs split between Beethoven and Philip
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Departing music directors do not typically end their tenures
with multiyear celebratory windups, but Davies' intensification of
activity with the orchestra is odder still, since his main reason
for stepping down is that he feels he cannot give the orchestra the
time it needs.
</P>
<P>
   His workload elsewhere has increased: Besides guest-conducting
in the United States and Europe, he is juggling the directorships
of the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra and the Vienna Radio Symphony
Orchestra, and last February he began to teach conducting at the
Salzburg Mozarteum.
</P>
<P>
   His living arrangements are accordingly scattered. He moved to
Stuttgart, Germany, in 1980, when he began a seven-year tenure as
general music director of the Stuttgart Opera, and re-established
his home there in 1995, when he became chief conductor of the
chamber orchestra. (In between, he was general music director of
the City of Bonn.) He has maintained an apartment in Vienna,
Austria, since he took over the radio orchestra in 1996, but he is
now considering making Salzburg his base. He also keeps a sparsely
furnished pied-a-terre in the New York's East Village, although his
visits there may be little more than layovers.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent visit, in August, lasted less than 24 hours,
during which he conducted a recording session (finishing Glass'
music for ``The Civil Wars,'' with the American Composers
Orchestra, for Nonesuch), held business meetings, and had dinner
with Glass, whose opera, ``The White Raven,'' was about to have its
premiere, led by Davies, in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just had one of those five-day periods that people are
supposed to avoid,'' Davies said at the time. ``Lisbon on Sunday,
Vienna on Monday, Salzburg on Tuesday, New York today, and tomorrow
I'm going to visit my parents in Toledo.''
</P>
<P>
   At 54, Davies has dropped the quasi-hippie trappings of yore. As
his hair has started to gray, the long locks he sported around a
balding pate in the early 1980s and the ponytail of more recent
years have given way to a shaved head and a closely trimmed
salt-and-pepper beard that makes him look like Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   In Stuttgart, he has just started a complete traversal of the
Haydn symphonies, which is scheduled to take 10 years, running
through the bicentennial of Haydn's death, in 2009. This is an
opportunity, he says, to work his way through the 107 works _ of
which he has until now led only 25 _ at a comfortable pace, much as
Helmuth Rilling did several years ago with the Bach cantatas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Rilling's Bach series in mind as a model, to be
honest,'' Davies said. Yet the charms of the series for him are
only partly musical. It is also an inventive packaging idea, and
packaging is something European orchestras will have to take more
seriously as government support dwindles. In this case Davies saw
an opportunity to win the support of DaimlerChrysler, maker of
Mercedes automobiles, which has a concert space in its new
headquarters in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Davies explained: ``I went to them and said: `Why not do
something really individual and serious? If you start now, you can
celebrate the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death by finishing the
series.'''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed five programs a year, each with two or three
symphonies, and a young soloist in contrasting repertory. ``So it's
both an introductory series for young artists and a forum for the
Haydn, which we are presenting in theme groups, rather than
chronologically,'' he added. ``We can have a series of pieces about
splendor, the Masons, different cities, the seasons. It's a way to
do No. 43 and No. 97 together without worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts are being recorded for CD release by ECM, the label
for which Davies and the orchestra are also recording the major
Mozart symphonies and piano concertos (with the jazz pianist Keith
Jarrett as soloist) as well as a series of 20th-century works.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Davies conducts a lot of new music in Stuttgart, but the Vienna
Radio Symphony is even better bred to contemporary styles. And
although it ranks behind the Vienna Philharmonic and the Vienna
Symphony, its appearance last summer at the Salzburg Festival and
its recent recordings of works by Glass and John Adams have given
the orchestra an international profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two special things about it,'' Davies said. ``One is
that it has all the good women players, because the philharmonic
wouldn't have them. Officially, that has now changed, and I believe
the philharmonic, because they don't have any choice. If you look
at the music schools, the majority of the good players are women,
and they are especially motivated. Our orchestra is 40 percent
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing I love about this orchestra is that you can't
put a new score in front of them that they can't immediately
sight-read. There is nothing they haven't done or don't know how to
do. You're not confronted with opinions about the music. They just
play it. I find that refreshing. And when we do the mixed programs
I like to do, we can spend time working on Beethoven and Brahms,
because the new music is the least of our worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many American maestros, Davies has found that despite the
availability of guest-conducting jobs with major American
orchestras, music directorships are still offered mainly to
Europeans. He does not seem particularly bitter about this
situation and betrays little emotion when discussion turns to the
number of big American orchestras _ principally, the New York
Philharmonic and the Philadelphia and Cleveland orchestras _ now
shopping for music directors.
</P>
<P>
   His response has been to build a solid career in Germany, and
now Austria, over two decades, as well as a respectable discography
of standard and contemporary works. His teaching post, too,
suggests a permanent presence in Europe. At the Mozarteum, someone
appointed to a professorship before age 55, like Davies, can retire
at 68 and continue to draw a full salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about my later years,'' Davies said, ``and this
seemed a bit of nice, prudent planning.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Davies' slow departure from the American Composers
Orchestra also represents prudent planning in that it leaves the
organization ample time to find a successor, a process that has
just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra is something Dennis and I cooked up over lunch,
back in September 1975,'' said Francis Thorne, a composer and the
orchestra's president. For the ensemble's first 15 years, Davies
was its principal conductor, rather than music director; the
programming was a collaboration with an advisory board of
composers.
</P>
<P>
   When Thorne proposed changing the title to music director, in
1990, Davies imposed two conditions: that the orchestra increase
the number of its concerts and that it adopt a definition of
``American'' that would embrace composers from all over the Western
hemisphere. The series ``Sonidos de las Americas,'' which was
started as a result in 1994, has explored the symphonic, chamber
and folk music of a different Latin American country every year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has allowed a few European composers into the
programming, and the ``20th Century Snapshots'' series will embrace
several more, including Ravel, whose Concerto for the Left Hand is
featured in ``The Gershwin Circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, it was felt that there were too few
opportunities for American composers, and our orchestra addressed
that,'' Davies said. ``When we started `Sonidos,' some of the
composers objected, until I was able to convince them that we had a
chance to expand our influence in the community and that composers
from other countries who participated would take American works
home with them. And that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This orchestra has done yeoman's work for more than 20 years,
and now I think it's time for it to become more international. You
make friends for American music that way.''

GETTING THE MOST FROM THOSE BONUS MILES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's free, there must be a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the watchwords for U.S. airlines' frequent flier
programs, undeniably the most successful marketing scheme on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has ever tried to redeem mileage for a free seat
can tell you, there are two major problems _ free seats are usually
unavailable for when you most want to fly and keeping track of the
rules can be mind-numbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't keep up with all that's being offered,'' said
Steven Peterson, president of the Travelware service for monitoring
companies' frequent flier accounts. ``It takes a fair amount of
time to figure out and you can wind up being on hold with the
airline for 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of people are willing to do just that. An
estimated 75 million people worldwide belong to some kind of
frequent flier program; airlines generate an estimated $1.5 billion
annually from selling the miles to partners for 2 cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines have realized that if they sell their miles in small
pieces, a lot of them are never used,'' Peterson noted. The money
that airlines receive from partners is more than enough to
administer programs that fill seats that otherwise would have gone
unused, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept, launched in 1981 through American Airlines'
AAdvantage (cq) program, gives customers mileage credits tied to
spending on travel staples such as airline tickets, rental cars,
hotels and credit cards. The idea eventually created an entire
cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   American, for example, offers mileage through five car rental
companies, two dozen hotel chains, real estate, FTD, MCI, Citibank,
AT&AMP;T, Jack Nicklaus/Golden Bear Golf Inc., Bull &AMP; Bear Securities,
along with programs for auto purchasing, dining and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions abound. Continental Airline's OnePass members can
earn 500 miles by completing a survey; Trans World Airlines'
Get-A-Member program gave miles for referrals; United Airlines
gives 5,000 Mileage Plus miles for California and Pennsylvania
residents who sign up for Green Mountain Energy Resources by Jan.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Even a second-tier flier like America West Airlines devotes 25
staff positions at its Phoenix headquarters to administering
FlightFund programs. ``We continually look at opportunities to
enhance partnerships,'' said spokeswoman Patty Nowack. ``All the
major airlines are pretty competitive in areas like hotels, car
rental, partnerships with other airlines, long-distance service and
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   You generally need 25,000 miles to qualify for a free ticket.
Get enough miles _ say, half a million, worth $10,000 _ and you
could fly yourself and spouse or best friend around the world
first-class for free.
</P>
<P>
   Sound easy? Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   First, you're going to have to do most of the work yourself
unless you have an exceptionally good relationship with your travel
agent or travel office at work, since airlines don't pay
commissions to agents for flights booked with frequent flier
mileage. ``You might be able to get your agent to help if you give
them a lot of business,'' said Glendale-based agent Amy Bernard
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Some simple steps:
</P>
<P>
   -- Focus on one or two programs, particularly if you're using
carriers in a frequent flier alliance: United-Delta,
Northwest-Continental or American-US Airways. ``Don't spread out
over multiple programs because it will take a lot longer for you to
reach award levels,'' said Jim Glab, contributing editor at
Frequent Flyer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Once you decide which programs you're focusing on, learn all
the partners. Glab suggests using Web sites rather than waiting for
monthly or quarterly newsletters to stay updated on changes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be aware of expiration dates, often Dec. 31 of each calendar
year. United, American and Northwest require miles to be used
within a defined period of time; Delta has no expiration but
requires you must fly at least once every three years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be willing to be flexible, especially on popular routes and
during heavy travel periods. Airlines will be reluctant to give
away what they can sell, so be prepared to travel outside of summer
and during midweek. ``Don't be too rigid,'' Herman said. ``When you
call, have several date choices.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Offer to change planes rather than going nonstop. That may
mean several hours in Cleveland or Houston but remember, free is
free.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be willing to use a suburban airport, such as Ontario or
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena, for domestic flights and a less popular
European one, like Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   -- Look for deals. Airlines starting to fly new routes or
offering deep discounts will likely to be trying to unload free
seats.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you fly a lot, use resources such as Web sites and
magazines like Frequent Flyer ($24 a year; (630) 574-6000) and
Inside Flyer ($36 a year; (719) 597-8880).
</P>
<P>
   -- Plan before you call. ``Figuring out partnerships and
blackout dates can be very difficult,'' Peterson said.

TALK OF LEAGUE TO RIVAL THE NBA IS JUST THAT _ TALK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the prospect of the National Basketball Association season
being canceled increases, so has talk that a rival league will be
formed.
</P>
<P>
   Many player agents have said recently that if the season was
terminated, a new league involving some of the NBA's biggest stars
could be in place by next fall. And in a nationwide conference call
on Monday, the players association director, Billy Hunter,
mentioned for the second time in two weeks that the season's
cancellation would make room for a competing league to step in and
ruin the lucrative monopoly the NBA has enjoyed for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the owners have to be aware that there are people
out there who are probably anxious to replace them,'' Hunter said.
``These people don't have a monopoly on money. They're not the only
millionaires and billionaires in the country. There are a lot of
people who would like to have an in when it comes to professional
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he had received any concrete offers from
networks or potential owners, Hunter admitted that he had not. And
that is why many observers believe that agents and union leaders
are simply not being realistic when they speak matter-of-factly
about the possible formation of a new league, one that, as Hunter
said two weeks ago, would leave the NBA ``decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great skepticism that this is the case,'' said Neal
Pilson, owner of the Pilson Communications sports consulting
company and a former president of CBS Sports. ``The logistics of
starting a new league and commanding the level of salary that these
players feel they are entitled to is immense. I don't know where to
begin in terms of the difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and agents Arn Tellem, Steve Kauffman, Bill Duffy, Mark
Bartelstein, Anthony Dutt and Eric Rudolph have all said a new
league would be a viable option for the players if the season were
canceled, but none of them is advocating such a venture. They
maintain that reaching a settlement and keeping the NBA intact is
their priority. But they also believe that if the season is lost a
league that could offer a significant challenge to the NBA would be
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a new league is an inevitability if they cancel the
season,'' said Duffy, who represents Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1
selection in last summer's NBA draft. ``Everyone's focus will go
toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said, ``If this season collapses, the whole basketball
landscape will change dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, the powerful agent who represents Michael Jordan,
Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and other star players, said he had
been contacted by several parties interested in pursuing the idea
of a competing league.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics such as Pilson believe a new league would be unable
to overcome the large obstacles of securing network broadcasting
contracts and finding adequate arenas in which to play, not to
mention putting together a solid infrastructure complete with front
offices and public and community relations staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant impediment would be in the area of
broadcasting. The NBA already has deals with NBC and Time Warner's
TNT and TBS cable networks, and those entities are not likely to
risk endangering that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, Time Warner's WB Network is unlikely to try
to use professional basketball to propel itself onto the
broadcasting map, as Fox did in 1993, by signing on to broadcast
NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the speculation about a new league has centered on the
news-media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who controls cable television's
Fox Sports Net. Rudolph said it was his understanding that Murdoch
was prepared to invest heavily in a new league once Commissioner
David Stern cancels the season. But Vince Wladika, senior vice
president of media relations for Fox Sports, calls such talk
unfounded, pointing out that Fox carries games locally for 26 of
the 29 NBA teams (with average contracts lasting seven years) and
that Murdoch is also a minority owner of the Knicks and thus in
both instances would be competing against himself by trying to form
a new league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents are having a fun time trying to spread that around,
but we're not a company that has a tendency to devalue its
properties,'' Wladika said. ``Those rumors are being spread by
people who don't know the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have intimated that CBS would have an interest in a rival
league because it held the broadcast rights to NBA games during the
1980s, and also because Tellem's wife, Nancy, is the network's
president of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But LeslieAnne Wade of CBS, which reacquired rights to part of
the NFL package this season after losing them in 1993, shot down
that theory. She admitted that the network had talks with agents
months ago but said nothing they proposed made good business sense
for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had more of a need and desire before we got the
NFL back,'' said Wade, the vice president of communications for CBS
Sports. ``But with pro football, college football, college
basketball, Nascar and a very big golf schedule, we don't have the
room to broadcast professional basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC also denied having any interest in a new league. Such talk,
however, does not discourage Hunter and the agents. In fact, they
said, it is what they expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the dilemmas you encounter in a situation like this is
that folks who may be interested _ and there have been some
expressions of interest _ are not inclined to be used,'' Hunter
said. ``So no network or anybody else who's of any consequence is
going to permit you to use them as a leverage in an effort to get a
deal from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``So people let you know directly or indirectly that they're
interested. But their position is that they're waiting to see if
the season's canceled. If and when the season's canceled, I think
that there will be people forthcoming.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The degree of difficulty of finding arenas to play in would
depend on where the league put franchises. Seventeen of the NBA's
29 buildings are publicly owned so they would presumably be open to
new tenants. Several are team-owned, such as Madison Square Garden,
the MCI Center in Washington and Detroit's Palace of Auburn Hills,
Mich., and would certainly be off limits to a competing league.
Others are privately owned, but not wholly by team owners, and
might or might not be available.r
</P>
<P>
   Several teams _ Miami, Indiana and Dallas _ are building new
arenas for the 1999-2000 season, so their old buildings would be
available. But those arenas, as well as many college facilities a
new league might use, would lack the revenue-generating ability
(such as luxury boxes and capacity) of the glitzy new NBA arenas.
That would make it difficult for a new league to compete with the
NBA in the critical area of player salaries and to afford the many
extravagances such as charter planes and five-star hotels to which
players have become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said a rival league would counter that by fielding far
fewer teams _ perhaps 10 _ than the 29 now enrolled in the NBA,
thereby allowing it to offer competitive salaries by spreading the
money among fewer players. And Hunter, while admitting that a new
league would not be able to pay rank-and-file players what they
make in the NBA, said it could perhaps pay superstars their market
value. And with about 100 free agents possibly joining the list of
200 current free agents in the summer of 1999, plenty of players
might be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Michael Jordan were around and inclined to play, I'm sure
that anybody starting a new league would be happy to have him and I
don't think they would probably have any reservations about paying
him whatever it was he dictated because they know of the
credibility he would give to the league,'' Hunter said. ``Not only
Michael, but other ballplayers _ Patrick, Alonzo, Shaq. You name
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter, who was referring to Ewing, Mourning and Shaquille
O'Neal, may be wrong in assuming that players would leave the NBA
for an experimental venture.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Stars Vin Baker of the Seattle Supersonics and Chris
Webber of the Sacramento Kings, speaking before the recent
player-sponsored ``Game on Showtime'' in Atlantic City, did not
like the idea of splitting up the league's tremendous talent pool.
Playing against watered-down competition that perhaps would not
include some of the game's greatest players did not appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in a new league is something that I really wouldn't
consider,'' Baker said. ``I like watching the ABA on the Classic
Sports Network, but I don't want to be a part of any red, white and
blue basketball. I grew up watching the NBA and I've got some time
left in my career, so I'll wait until something's resolved in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber said: ``The NBA is the epitome of basketball and unless
every single player were to go, I don't think I would want to. If
we don't have a season, yes, maybe I would participate in other
charity games, but as far as another league, I think I would wait
for the NBA.''

   11 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PREPARE FOR ONE CURRENCY
</P>
<P>
   After decades of dreams, diplomacy and delays, the single
European currency, the euro, is close to becoming a reality. On
Thursday, 11 European countries are to lock their exchange rates to
the euro, now worth about $1.17, and cede to the new European
Central Bank the power to set interest rates and monetary policy.
The currency will officially be introduced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the euro is quickly catching on. At a supermarket
outside Strasbourg, a mecca for cross-border shoppers, everything
from bananas to televisions has been priced in euros, and French
francs, for months. At upscale restaurants, euro-pricing on menus
is a fashion must. In Paris, 11 giant balloons representing the
participating countries are on display outside the headquarters of
Paribas, the financial-services giant.
</P>
<P>
   MOST STATES MEETING WELFARE RULES
</P>
<P>
   The first official data from the federal government show that
most states are meeting the work requirements of the 1996 welfare
law, with 28 percent of adults on the rolls participating in some
type of work activity, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE MORTGAGE RATES RISE
</P>
<P>
   Five major Japanese banks said they would raise mortgage rates
by as much as 0.8 percent, the first sign that soaring interest
rates will squeeze the already embattled Japanese consumer. A sixth
bank had already raised its rates.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA TO GET $1.35 BILLION LOAN
</P>
<P>
   Twelve foreign banks said they had agreed to lend Malaysia $1.35
billion at an interest rate substantially below what the government
would have to pay to raise much-needed cash on the international
bond market.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG AUCTION LIFTS BOND PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose for a second day after the Treasury encountered
stronger-than-expected demand at its auction of $15 billion in
two-year notes. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell to
5.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BP EXPECTS APPROVAL OF DEAL
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum expects its $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco
to clear the last remaining hurdle and secure federal regulatory
approval before the weekend, a spokesman said. The Federal Trade
Commission would only say that it was reviewing the merger.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BRITISH COMPANY SEEKS MERGER
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co. PLC of Britain said it was looking at
Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Thomson-CSF of France and
British Aerospace as possible merger partners. The British company,
unrelated to General Electric of the United States, said no deal
would be announced before the new year.
</P>
<P>
   HOME SALES ROSE 2.7 PERCENT IN NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Sales of existing homes rose in November to their
second-strongest rate ever, energized by optimistic consumers, low
mortgage rates and job gains. The National Association of Realtors
said that sales of existing homes increased 2.7 percent last month,
to an annual rate of 4.90 million units, close to the record pace
of 4.91 million units in July. For all of 1998, the association
expects sales of existing homes to set an annual record for the
third consecutive year.

 &HT;    Big defenses go head-to-head in the Big Easy
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Their defenses are each dominant enough to have
earned their own nicknames: ``The Wrecking Crew'' of Texas A&AMP;M and
the ``Silver Bullets'' of Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Each features a star linebacker in Aggie senior Dat Nguyen, this
year's Lombardi Award winner, and Buckeye junior Andy Katzenmoyer,
the 1997 Butkus Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   And each defense, ranked in the top 10 nationally, relies on
quickness and pressure to force the opposing offense out of its
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in philosophy, we're a lot the same,'' Texas A&AMP;M head
coach R.C. Slocum said. ``Ohio State looks to pressure you in
passing situations and we like to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference may be in the teams' secondary, with the edge
going to OSU.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's highly touted secondary, led by consensus
All-American and Thorpe Award winner Antoine Winfield, is second in
the nation vs. the pass and allowed just seven touchdown passes all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Ohio State's secondary, there's no weakness in
it,'' A&AMP;M offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said. ``I think
(OSU defensive coordinator) Fred (Pagac) does a great job with the
zone blitzes, kind of the in-vogue thing in the National Football
League right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies 10th-ranked overall defense likes to pressure the
opposing quarterback as much as possible, too. One way they try to
do it is by rotating their defensive linemen to keep them rested
and fresh. Ohio State began doing the same thing this season after
its starters wore down in last season's Sugar Bowl loss to Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he's been pleasantly surprised by his young and
undersized defensive line. (His three starters are sophomores and
two of his three backups, freshman.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big concern at the start of the season,'' he said of
his line. ``As the season progressed, it's really not been.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's defensive line has matured as the season has
progressed as well. Sophomore end Brent Johnson, slated as a back
up to junior James Cotton in spring practice, moved into a
starter's spot almost immediately and led the team in sacks with
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore linebacker Na'il Diggs, too, has become a standout
member of the Buckeyes' second-ranked defense, finishing the
regular season second in team tackles with 74.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' Slocum insists his team is without a true star. But
Nguyen (pronounced Win) has played like one. He leads the team in
tackles with 147 and is the heart and soul of the Aggies defense.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum is concerned Nguyen's sprained big toe could hamper his
quickness and side-to-side mobility, skills the 5-11 linebacker
relies on to compensate for his lack of size. But Nguyen said he'll
be ready to play as he always does.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, OSU's Big Kat will be ready to pounce on an Aggie who
tries to run up the middle. The Buckeyes are the No. 1 defense in
the nation against the run, giving up fewer than 68 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a weakness in their defense,'' A&AMP;M
quarterback Branndon Stewart said. ``I think their secondary will
be the best we've played.'

 How Giving Can Mean Tax Break  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  Can I deduct the cost of holiday gifts from my company's
taxable income?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  They say it's better to give than receive. But it's
even better if you can display the holiday spirit and get a tax
break at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, you can deduct up to
$25 for business gifts to any one person during your tax year. (See
``Tax info for business'' at  &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   If you give gifts to members of a customer's family, you also
will be limited to the single $25 deductible limit unless you have
a bona fide, business connection with each family member and the
gift is intended for that person's use.
</P>
<P>
   If you and your spouse give gifts, don't expect to double your
deductions, even if you have separate businesses or independent
connections with the recipient. The IRS treats both of you as one
taxpayer. Similarly, if a partnership gives gifts, the partnership
and the partners are treated as one taxpayer and cannot deduct more
than $25 per recipient.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how this works, if you give three $80 cheese
baskets to a company in thanks for its business and three
executives take the packages home to their families (with whom you
have no business relationships), you can deduct only $75 of your
$240 cost. (That deduction is arrived at by multiplying the three
gifts times the $25 limit.)
</P>
<P>
   Incidental costs such as packaging, insurance and mailing
generally are not included in the $25 per recipient annual limit.
But make sure the costs really are incidental.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the value of the basket in the above example is
``substantial'' compared to the value of the cheese, you can't add
it to the $25 limit.
</P>
<P>
   Items that might be considered either a gift or entertainment
expenses generally are considered an entertainment expense by the
IRS. But if you give customers packaged food or beverages intended
for their use at a later date, treat it as a gift expense.
</P>
<P>
   Not included in the $25 limit are items costing $4 or less (like
pens) that are identical and widely distributed and have your name
clearly and permanently imprinted on them.
</P>
<P>
   Home Office Write-Offs
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I deduct business expenses such as phone bills, electric
bills and rent from my home business even though I didn't have any
income from the business this year. If yes, is there a limit on
such deductions?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have a separate phone line for your business, you can
deduct the entire expense, according to Mary Kay Foss of the
Danville accounting firm Marzluft Giles Tulis &AMP; Foss. If you use
your residential line, you can only deduct the cost of itemized
toll calls for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Phone bills, like office supplies and postage, are considered
direct business expenses. Electricity and other costs connected
with running your home office such as rent, real estate taxes,
insurance, casualty losses, depreciation, painting and repairs are
considered indirect expenses and you cannot deduct these unless you
show a profit. However you can carry these costs over indefinitely
to future years when you have a profit to offset.
</P>
<P>
   However, before deducting any home office expenses, you must
meet rigid requirements. In general, you're out of luck if you use
a part of your home for both personal and business purposes. For
example, if you run your business out of your den during the day
and watch TV in the same room in the evening, you get no deduction.
There are exceptions if you are a qualified day care provider or
use a part of your house for storage of inventory or product
samples.
</P>
<P>
   According to Topic 509 on the IRS Web site, before you can
deduct business-use-of-the-home expenses, part of your home must be
used ``regularly and exclusively'' as your principal place of
business and the place where you meet and deal with your patients,
clients or customers ``in the normal course'' of your business.
</P>
<P>
   The amount deducted depends on the percentage of your home used
for business. To calculate this, divide the number of square feet
used for business by the total square feet in your home. Or, if the
rooms are about the same size, divide the number of rooms used for
business by the total number of rooms in your home.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on business use of your home, refer to Tax
Topic 509, or Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home. To order

 Governor Declares State of Emergency Over Citrus Crisis  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Governor Pete Wilson declared a state of emergency yesterday in the
four California counties hardest hit by the freeze that chilled the
Central Valley's citrus industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson singled out Fresno, Kern, Tulare and Madera counties,
where four-straight nights of subfreezing weather has ruined all of
the lemon crop and a substantial but still undetermined portion of
the orange crop.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he also will ask President Clinton for federal
assistance for those counties, which have suffered an estimated
$591 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage done by the recent cold spell has been devastating
to California's orange, lemon and grapefruit crops,'' Wilson said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because California accounts for about 80 percent of the oranges
eaten as fruit in the United States, the freeze will mean that
consumers across the nation will pay 40 to 50 percent more for
fresh table oranges during the first six months of 1999, a federal
Agriculture Department economist said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of that morning glass of juice likely will remain
the same because the world still has ample supplies of juice
oranges, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if some are diverted to table oranges, it still wouldn't
affect the retail price of frozen concentrate,'' said Annette
Clauson, an agricultural economist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Price estimates still are fluid, but based on what's known about
California's crop damage so far, Clauson said the freeze will raise
table orange prices that averaged 62 cents to 64 cents per pound in
October and November.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of oranges grown for juice in Florida and Brazil still
are strong enough to meet demand, said Bernard Savaiko, head of
futures research at PaineWebber Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilian crop looks better than first thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration of a state of emergency allows farmers, pickers,
packers and others out of work because of the freeze to begin
receiving up to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits without the
required one-week waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   After the more serious 1990 freeze, about 12,000 agricultural
workers were out of work for as much as a year and the state and
federal governments were slow to declare an emergency, said Joel
Nelsen, president of California Citrus Mutual, a growers trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people down here had to wait six months before
they saw any kind of relief,'' Nelsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers hope disaster relief enables them to get short-term
loans that will help keep some of the workers employed to repair
and prepare citrus groves for the next season's harvests.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to minimize the impact on local businesses built
around the citrus industry,'' Nelsen said. ``Maybe the wheels of
bureaucracy do move a little more rapidly now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, San Joaquin Valley growers have initiated a voluntary
moratorium on picking and packing any oranges until at least Monday
to give them more time to assess fruit damage. Growers who can't
wait may place a hold on the shipment of any oranges for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The movement started in yesterday morning in Tulare County,
where some growers bitterly complained that some of their
counterparts were shipping freeze-damaged fruit to recoup losses
and take advantage of rising wholesale prices. But the citrus
association fears that shipping sour or decayed oranges will
literally leave a bad taste in consumers' mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure good fruit is reaching the marketplace,''
said Nelsen. ``This will allow additional hang time on the trees so
there are ample hours for the decay to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism abounded earlier this week because growers were finding
more undamaged fruit on their trees than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that caused a false sense of security,'' Nelsen said.
``On one hand it looks good, but wiser heads are saying something's
not right.''

 By SUSAN B. ADAMS and SAMANTHA STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLD COAST, Australia _ The search has been called off for two
missing sailors in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, and with four
others confirmed dead, the 54th running of the event is already the
second worst disaster in modern yacht-racing history.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the loss of life and vessels, the Australian disaster
also pointed out that no matter how sophisticated and integral
weather forecasting has become in modern yacht racing and how well
yachts are built to withstand extreme conditions, there will always
be yachtsmen and women who challenge Nature's primacy on the high
seas. And that, even with warning, man and boat are little match
for 90-mile-per-hour winds and 35-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for the Hobart race predicted a fierce storm along the
route, which runs south along Australia's east coast, across the
eastern edge of Bass Strait, down the east coast of Tasmania and up
the Derwent River to the city of Hobart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely going to occur, it was just a matter to
determine where it would happen,'' Roger Badham, a professional
forecaster for yachtsmen, told Reuters on Tuesday. ``On the day of
the race, just after it started, I saw the next global prediction
and I said, `This is Armageddon.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the boats raced on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a concern whether to continue on,'' said Bob
Wylie, a sail trimmer on Sayonara. ``We were well-informed by our
navigator about the treacherous weather that was ahead. Last
evening, we heard the news of people missing, sailors down, on a
little a.m. radio on boat. The trip had been manageable, and then,
we knew how deadly it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hobart-to-Sydney race also raised questions as to where the
responsibility of race organizers ends and that of the sailors
takes over in the decision to continue racing in abject conditions.
The Australian race showed that officials are loathe to infringe
upon a sailor's pride or courage when it comes to calling off a
contest with the sea, and on Tuesday, race officials defended
themselves from sharp criticism over continuing the contest.
</P>
<P>
   But when the storm had finally cleared, and as the race
continued on Tuesday, observers were left to ponder a yacht-racing
tragedy, second only in scope to the 1979 Fastnet race off Britain
when 15 yachtsmen died in a storm. Prior to this week's debacle,
there had been only two reported deaths in the Sydney-to-Hobart,
Australia's greatest yacht race.
</P>
<P>
   The 725-mile race starts the day after Christmas and attracts
elite sailors and yachts from around the world. Of the 115 yachts
that entered this year, 70 withdrew from the race because of the
hurricane-strength winds; six boats were abandoned or sank; and
some 56 sailors were hauled to safety in a massive airlift
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if I were on a wild bronco,'' said Bill Erklens, the
captain of Sayonara, the American maxi-yacht that won the race,
``and 60-mile-an-hour fire hoses of water were shot at me. A solid
wave would come in the black night in unexpected movements and
knock you flat. It hits hard and bruises your ribs in smashing
waves. One crewman broke his ankle when he was pushed off the side
of the boat. We were clipped in our safety harnesses. We did what
we had to to get here and keep the boat in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to win, but we wanted to get here in one piece,''
said Wylie. ``After the news of the injured and missing, the crew
was real quiet. Ours was an experienced group. We had sailed
together for three or four years. The other boats didn't have the
depth _ they might have sailed together in an off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sea state was the hardest task for us. It was a confused
seaway, with a sharpness of waves. We had damage, we didn't get off
scot-free. At night, you don't see the waves coming, there is no
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to anticipate the impact. The jet wash swept me across
the deck and there was a concern I wouldn't stop. We were mostly
ahead of the system, with 30-50 knots batting at us. it was really
windy and the top of the waves dashed on the boat. Just to get
through the weaves, we told ourselves. They were falling on us,
loud, crashing, shuddering. And everyone shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo van Kretschmar, the commodore of the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizers, promised a review into all aspects
of the way the race was conducted and the safety standards
employed. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which
coordinated the massive search and rescue operation for stricken
yachts and missing crew, has agreed to help.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kretschmar said there was a case for more frequent and
comprehensive weather reports, but he was opposed to delaying the
start because of adverse forecasts. He said that because of the
length of the race and the difficulty in accurately predicting
weather more than two days ahead, a delay could result in the
yachts ending up in even worse weather.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet, which left Sydney in bright sunshine on Saturday, was
torn apart the next day by the storm that strafed the 115 starters
with 60-to-80-knot winds and mountainous waves. According to John
Finch of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Australian
navy frigate Newcastle and local fishing and merchant vessels also
joined in the three-day effort over 8,600 nautical miles. The
Newcastle's final assignment was assisting police in towing the
40-foot yacht, Business Post Naiad, with two dead sailors aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was horrendous,'' said Finch, a veteran mariner and
Maritime officer. ``We are career mariners and ex-pilots and this
was as horrendous as we've witness. We have suspended the search
and rescue at 5:15 p.m. Australian time today. We may never find
the two who are still missing. It's a big ocean out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the missing sailors, 33-year-old Briton Glyn Charles, had
represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Summer Olympics
in Atlanta. The other missing sailor was John Dean of Australia, a
crew member on the yacht Winston Churchill, which sank.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two Winston Churchill crew members, Jim Lawler and
Michael Bannister, were found on Tuesday. Two other Australian
sailors, skipper Bruce Guy and crewman Phil Skeggs, were found dead
Monday after Business Post Naiad capsized.

</P>
<P>
   Of the 39 yachts that survived the storm, the 80-foot maxi yacht
Sayonara, skippered by the New Zealand America's Cup veteran Chris
Dickson and owned by the American billionaire Larry Ellison,
crossed the finish line first in a winning time of 2 days, 3
minutes, with Brindabella second and Ragamuffin third. The last
boat is expected to finish on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison was distraught and did not wait around for the winner's
ceremony on Saturday, immediately flying home to San Francisco.
Before he left, however, he lambasted officials and said he would
never return to the race, ``not if I live to a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``Everyone lines up for this race
expecting a difficult race, but no one expects a dangerous race.
You know this is not what this is supposed to be about ...
Difficult yes, dangerous no, life-threatening definitely not. And I
think a lot of us are upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Erklens, Sayonara's captain and Ellison's boat project manager,
put Ellison's words in context with the rest of the crew, ``He
hasn't done a lot of this kind of sailing,'' said Erklens. ``It
brought it home how dangerous it can be when you are at the mercy
of the weather. Somehow, I doubt he will ever return here. We all
have mixed feelings. The adventure of our achievement was one piece
and then the human loss. That changed our whole psyche and dampened
the rest of our race.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kretschmar, who sailed in the 1979 Fastnet race, said there
were similarities between the two disasters. In both cases the
problems arose from the weather turning suddenly and unexpectedly
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unsinkable and uncontrollable yacht, like the Titanic,
doesn't exist,'' van Kretschmar said. ``But we must learn from this
experience and seek to make the sport safer.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended the international rules that the Australian
club follows, which place the responsibility on deciding whether to
retire firmly on individual skippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 54 years, we've only had two deaths before now,'' van
Kretschmar said. ``On an international scale, Hobart sets the
highest standards. We've learned a lot from the experience. I've
sailed 18 races and I'm confident I will do another. But I fear
others don't know how this race is run and we risk the regulation
of government authorities. That would run us out of business.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Rick Burleigh
supported him. ``In the end, it's the skipper's responsibility if
he wants to race or not,'' he said. &QL;

INNOVATIVE COLLEGE TRAINS NEXT GENERATION OF INVENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES RYAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Breeden and his classmates at Hampshire College in Amherst,
Mass., are eagerly awaiting fresh powder at nearby Ascutney
Mountain. It's not that they plan to do much skiing. Rather,
they'll be testing a new snowboard for the disabled that they are
developing under an unusual program to foster inventors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last semester was frustrating,'' said the 21-year-old Breeden,
who devotes much of his spare time to the project. ``We finally got
a prototype together, and all the snow melted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hampshire program, financed by the Lemelson Foundation, has
helped reshape the image of a small, experimental central
Massachusetts college, long saddled with the nickname Frisbee U.
because of its eccentric student body and grade-free curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Prince Jr., Hampshire's president, has championed the
5-year-old program as a way to promote the college among business
and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They suddenly see us as a very entrepreneurial,
business-friendly institution,'' Prince said. ``Prior to that, we
were seen as somewhat radical, different and, I suspect, a little
bit flaky.''
</P>
<P>
   While the college, founded in 1970, has not entirely shed that
reputation _ there are no grades, no departments, no majors _ the
Lemelson program has given students a grounding in real-world
economics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the snowboard, undergraduates have dreamed up an
ergonomic bass guitar, off-road in-line skates and an inflatable
playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is that the inventions created under the program
someday be marketed. Grants ranging from a few hundred dollars to
several thousand are awarded to students, teams or professors to
develop their ideas. Mass Ventures, a company based in Amherst, has
been enlisted to help students get their inventions to market. One
student product, an Internet calendar, has raised $150,000 in seed
capital, and an organic method of pest control for corn is expected
to be on the market next year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created by Jerome Lemelson, an independent
inventor who died last year. Lemelson held more than 500 patents,
including one on the cassette drive mechanism that made the Sony
Walkman possible. He spent much of his life battling corporations
for royalty payments, and ultimately won hundreds of millions of
dollars in settlements. He devoted himself in later years to
helping the next generation of entrepreneurial inventors.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Hampshire program was hatched over dinner in
1993. Lemelson, whose son and daughter-in-law attended Hampshire
and who believed in the college's cross-disciplinary approach,
asked Prince whether it was possible to teach creativity. ``I said,
`All I want to do is just unleash it,''' Prince recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Lemelson Foundation _ currently endowed at $30
million but with a commitment from the Lemelson family for an
endowment of at least $100 million by the end of 1999 _ has spent
$5 million on the Hampshire program, with $705,540 awarded in
grants. A separate national program, also based at Hampshire, has
awarded more than $1 million to innovation courses or individual
inventors at some 80 universities and colleges since its inception
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Courses offered at Hampshire under the Lemelson banner have
names as unusual as their subjects: ``How People Move,''
``Pesticide Alternatives'' and ``Is the Mouse Dead: The Psychology
of Human-Computer Interface.'' College officials estimate that 20
percent of their 1,000 or so students take one or more Lemelson
courses by graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The classes are spawning grounds for ideas, although only a few
of those ideas get to the design stage or even closer to
realization, as prototypes. None of the student-developed products
has yet been widely marketed or made it through the patent process,
which can take years.
</P>
<P>
   But several patent applications are pending, among them one for
the snowboard designed for the disabled. The patent would be in the
name of Collin Twitchell, the instructor who conceived the idea,
and two students, Matt Capozzi and Nate Henshaw-Plath, who helped
develop the prototype. Hampshire would actually own the patent,
however, and then grant commercialization rights back to the
inventors, who would be entitled to all royalties except 5 percent
divided between the college and the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a paint-spattered blue jumpsuit, Breeden now spends four
or five nights a week working on the snowboard prototype in the
on-campus machine shop of the program's Center for Assistive
Technology, devoted to design for the disabled. The shop is
equipped with a lathe, welding equipment and a machine for plastic
injection molding.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden and his class inherited the snowboard project from the
original team after its members graduated. In fact, few students
seem to want to see a project through to completion, an inclination
that has frustrated the program's officials. Capozzi, who has since
graduated, chafed at what he perceived as pressure from the program
to start a business based on the snowboard prototype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fight tooth and nail not to set up shop in a
garage,'' said Capozzi, who had received $8,000 in grant money. Of
the snowboard, he said, ``I want to see it out there, I just wasn't
willing to commit the rest of my life to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the program are beginning to understand that most
students, no matter how focused and independent, are like Capozzi:
not ready to start a business right out of college.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Praeger, vice president of the foundation, acknowledges
the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Bill Gates every once in a while,'' Praeger said,
``but it doesn't happen very often. Maybe we should take a longer
view: They'll go work for a big business and then start their own
business at 28 or 29, when they are mature enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not its graduates ever create businesses of their
own, the program will have benefited them, says its director,
Brenda Philips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thinking skills that you learn, can be very
effectively applied in work settings,'' she said.

<P>
   Students agree that the program helps focus their career goals
and gives them an inside track in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   One recent graduate, Jerome Little, developed a bass guitar with
a twisted neck so aging rockers could avoid carpal tunnel syndrome.
He has since landed a job with the renowned guitar maker Ken
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   When he enrolled at Hampshire, Capozzi thought he would study
ornithology. ``But after taking all these classes, I found I was
doing all this design in my spare time,'' he said. ``The program
gave me confidence to go out there and do something.'' Having
graduated last year, he now works in product design at Burton
Snowboards in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, who previously was an associate dean at Dartmouth
College, expresses pleasure at the strides Hampshire has taken
toward providing a practical education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in as president 10 years ago, my colleagues tended
to be supportive, but basically dismissed Hampshire,'' he said.
``It was quaint, different and irrelevant. Ten years later they see
Hampshire and they know that we are doing what they want to do.''

UNION LEADER TAKES MANAGEMENT JOB AT RAYTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top union leader has stepped down from his post respresenting
Raytheon Co. workers to take a management job at the Lexington,
Mass. defense contractor, surprising many former allies.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Osborn Jr. announced his resignation as president of
Local 1505 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
earlier this month. He accepted a new job in Raytheon's personnel
office that begins in January.
</P>
<P>
   The move eliminates one of longer-serving officers of the local,
which represents several thousand employees and is one of the
state's more powerful labor group.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn faces some criticism for changing sides. ``Because he was
president and held other offices for so long, (some members) felt
that he was running out on them,'' said one union member who
attended a meeting in Waltham about ten days ago where the change
was announced. ``People were upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Tuesday Osborne said the change wasn't
improper because he won't have a role in future negotiations. He
also noted the job he has accepted at Raytheon was previously
filled by other former union officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went as long as I could for as hard as I could'' for the
IBEW, Osborn said. He added he wasn't leaving because of any
disagreements over union business. ``I just decided to make a
change in my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn also resigned from the executive board of the state's
AFL-CIO, surprising colleagues at the group where his father,
Arthur Osborn Sr., was president throughout the 1980s. ``He's a
solid trade unionist, so in that sense (his departure) is
disppointing,'' said Bob Haynes, the organization's current
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Haynes defended Osborn's shift. ``It has become a great
strategy of the business community to take the best people from the
labor movement...and companies like Raytheon need the kind of
expertise that Arthur has. He can bring them some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new job Osborne will help assure the company abides by
previous seniority agreements in its dealings with employees said
Raytheon spokesman Alan Csiky.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight-year tenure as second-in-command of the IBEW
local, Osborn ran the organization's internal operations and
participated in contract negotiations including a controversial
round in 1995. Then, the union agreed to wage concessions that
Raytheon executives said were needed to keep its missile plants in
the state competitive with firms in lower-cost states in the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal angered many rank-and-file members, who the next
year voted to oust many key union officers who involved in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn was a rare exception, keeping his job and continued to
serve under the union's new business manager, Michael Zagami. Other
IBEW members, who asked not to be named, said Zagami's popularity
had increased since a more generous contract was negotiated last
summer, and that Osborn probably wouldn't advance further within
the IBEW or the AFL-CIO. Moreover, changes promulgated by Zagami
meant the president's position was no longer a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arthur Osborn saw that this was it for him'' within
the local, one IBEW member said. Osborn said he didn't have major
differences with with Zagami or others but said he felt it was time
for a new president to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Zagami was travelling Tuesday and couldn't be reached for
comment. Other union officers declined to comment. As president,
Osborn has been replaced by Stanley Lichwala, an assistant business
manager, according to the local's site on the World Wide Web.

FIRE-RELATED DEATHS REVIVE NYC DEBATE ON SPRINKLERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DAN BARRY and MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two recent deadly fires in high-rise apartment
buildings have prompted the Giuliani administration and the City
Council to consider legislation that would require sprinkler
systems in at least some residential buildings. But the renewed
interest in an old debate also has each side accusing the other of
failing to champion similar measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that he supported in
principle some form of legislation that would require sprinklers in
residential buildings. But he added that he had directed his aides
to study such issues as which buildings should be covered by such a
law and where the sprinklers would be required. ``Sprinklers are a
good idea; they certainly help,'' he said. ``The question is just
exactly how they're used.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council members said the coming debate was likely to center
on whether the city should require sprinklers only in new
buildings, or whether it should require their installation in
existing buildings as well. A further point of contention is
whether to call for sprinklers only in hallways and other common
areas, or in all apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Council members say privately that they expect to pass a bill
that would require sprinklers only in hallways and other common
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Any bill is likely to face opposition. Last year, a
Council-sponsored bill calling for sprinkler systems in high-rise
apartment buildings died quietly because it was opposed by the
Giuliani administration, ignored by the Council leadership, and
lobbied against by the real-estate industry, whose ability to make
sizable campaign contributions has historically made it a force to
reckon with in city politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Fire Department drafted a proposal to require
sprinklers in new multiple-dwelling buildings. But that plan, which
was also opposed by the real-estate industry, was eventually
dropped by the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Giuliani and City Council leaders accused each other of
not pursuing past legislative proposals that would have brought the
city in line with sprinkler regulations that are standard in many
other parts of the country. That squabble played against a backdrop
of ongoing lobbying by the real estate industry and sprinkler
manufacturers, whose interests are opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Spigner, the chairman of the City Council's Housing and
Buildings Committee, said Tuesday that he received a telephone call
this week from developer Donald Trump, who expressed concern about
the high cost of installation and other problems that he had with
sprinklers. Trump confirmed Tuesday that he had ``received and
placed calls'' from and to various city officials.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of easy access to city leaders by the opposition
that proponents of sprinkler legislation fear. ``It is a hard
battle, because real- estate interests make political
contributions,'' said John Viniello, the president of the National
Fire Sprinkler Association, which has also made contributions and
whose members stand to profit from laws requiring sprinklers. ``If
they are financially supporting the City Council and the mayor, it
is difficult for politicians to take action that is unpopular with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   While most cities across the country require sprinklers in
residential buildings, New York City's fire code relies heavily on
fire-resistant construction intended to contain a fire until
firefighters arrive. Both fire officials and people in the
real-estate industry note that fire deaths in the city have
decreased dramatically recently; 101 people have died in fires this
year, the fewest in 42 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New
York, an industry group, said Tuesday that most fatal fires occur
in two- and three-family homes, not in high-rise buildings that
have fire-resistant construction. He and Trump said that in
addition to being costly, sprinklers were also prone to vandalism
and mishaps, and widely disliked by tenants for esthetic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for sprinkler systems say they vastly increase
safety. A 1994 memorandum drafted by the Fire Department states,
``Statistics show that sprinklers are the most effective fire
prevention tool available _ aside from casualties due to
firefighting and explosions, there are no recorded multiple losses
of life in fully sprinklered buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest in sprinkler legislation came after two
high-rise fires in the last two weeks claimed seven lives.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19 three firefighters were killed in a fire at a
city-managed apartment house for the elderly in Brooklyn. Because
that complex was built with federal funds, it was required by law
to have sprinklers in the hallways. But those sprinklers were
turned off, and the city has begun an inquiry to determine why.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Dec. 24, four people were killed in a fire
in a 51-story building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when
they fled to the stairwells and were overcome by smoke. In keeping
with city regulations, there were sprinklers only on the first 10
floors of that building, which are for commercial, not residential,
use.

WHO IS IN CHARGE, ARIZONA PRISON GANGS OR GUARDS?
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER 
 WILLIAM HERMANN and BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They smuggle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They extort money.
</P>
<P>
   They kill people who get in their way.
</P>
<P>
   And they do it all from behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   They are prison gangs, locked in a struggle for control of their
cellblock homes, with criminal tentacles reaching outside jail
walls.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Arizona prisons director Terry
Stewart, who was allegedly targeted for assassination last month by
the New Mexican Mafia, a violent gang with growing influence in
Arizona prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart survived when gunmen were scared off by the chance
appearance of Phoenix police officers at a Valley restaurant. But
experts in Arizona and across the nation say the core issue
remains:
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge, the gangs or the guards?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haro, who spent 16 years as an Arizona correctional officer
and managed gang inmates at Arizona State Prison-Florence, said the
public cannot fathom what it's like for 18 guards to oversee a yard
with 600 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the prisons only because they let us run the prisons,''
said Haro. ``We're talking about organized crime, and they're good
at it... These guys play for keeps. They'll cut your heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fleisher, a former prison administrator and author of books
on prison violence and gangs, emphasizes that whoever holds the gun
has the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the staff has the M-16s,'' he says. ``They control
the fence line. As long as the staff controls the fence line, the
staff controls the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fleisher does not underestimate the influence _ or
ruthlessness _ of inmate gangs such as the Aryan Brotherhood, the
Mexican Mafia and the Mau Mau.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get in their way, they'll kill you,'' he said.
``They're like carpenter ants. They'll eat right through you.
They'll just keep coming and coming and coming, and they'll get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is reflected in the numbers of
inmates affected by prison gangs: An estimated 5.7 million adults
are behind bars or on parole nationwide, including 24,000 Arizona
state prison inmates, and thousands more in county or federal
institutions here.
</P>
<P>
   About one of every 10 federal prisoners is in a gang, experts
say, while many more are associated with gangs, while not full-time
members.
</P>
<P>
   State corrections officials don't know how many Arizona inmates
belong to gangs, but estimate affiliation at about 1,000 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs thrive wherever inmates live, said James Purpin of the
American Correctional Association. But Arizona is particularly
fertile ground, he said, because of its dense metropolitan areas,
as well as being close to to California gangs and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Like other experts, Purpin said America's prison gangs have
swelled in membership and influence, complicating the job of
correctional officers _ and police on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Haro, the former prison guard, said gang leaders rule by fear
and attain status ``by being the most vicious (expletives) you can
be. They talk the talk, but they walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangs control the prison econ omy, he added, and illicit drugs
empower them even more, because money is as much a commodity inside
the walls as outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys have hun dreds of thousands of dollars on
the books (within the prison),'' Haro said. ``And some of them have
hundreds of thousands of dollars on the street in banks.''
</P>
<P>
   But brutal discipline, based on violence and organization, is
the key to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison gang is always much more structured than a street
gang because they're adult criminals,'' said Fleisher. ``They have
a lot of experience inside institutions, a lot of experience in
crime. They share a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case the purpose is to engage in profitable criminal
activi ties, and to control the inside of the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Under guard and lockdown, gang leaders rely on elaborate communi
cation networks that reach beyond prison walls. Inmates whisper in
the yards. Trustees pass information while at various jobs.
Prisoners use an assortment of codes for tapping messages in the
cellblocks and exchanging mail with confederates outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a network estab lished that's better than our
radios,'' Haro said.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, it may seem incredible that criminals are able
to get drugs and weapons past metal detectors or armed guards. But
Haro said it happens every day.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt employees who earn meager salaries are paid to smuggle
narcotics or look the other way. A broken television is sent out
for repairs and comes back with syrin ges concealed inside. Female
visi tors hide drugs and pass them to prisoners when they give a
greeting kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The result: About one-fourth of the inmates at SMU II in
Florence register dirty on routine drug tests, Haro said, and
that's the maximum security facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had enough staff or resources to be able to
prevent it,'' he added. ``And the bottom line is, that's prison
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Subhead:
</P>
<P>
   New inmates, known as ``fish,'' are screened by gang leaders, as
well as prison authorities. If the newcomer is a child molester, he
becomes prey for beatings. If he has wealthy family, he is an
extortion target.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Det. Jack Ballen tine, who has investigated
prison gangs for about 10 years, said inmates are approached first
based on ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are Hispanic, for in stance, you want to be protected
from the white and Black gangs,'' he said. ``You don't want to be
punked when you get in there: jumped in the shower and made some
guy's girlfriend. You want them to know you have friends, so the
message is, `Don't mess with me or my guys will take care of
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ballentine said some try to re main neutral, ``But it's very
tough, because they always, always pay you a visit when you get in.
They always learn about you, it's a given... You either `clique-up'
with a gang and get yourself taken care of or you fight the system
and you have no protection.
</P>
<P>
   But earning a gang ``patch,'' or full membership, is no easy
matter. Experts all emphasize the ``blood-in, blood-out'' code of
prison gangs: An inmate must kill or do serious violence to join,
and faces a death sentence for renounc ing membership.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Benitez, an ex-member of the New Mexican Mafia, learned
that the hard way. In January, five years after renouncing his gang
membership, a death contract caught up with the 30-year-old
criminal. He was found slumped over a toilet in his Tucson prison
cell, dead from a blade imbedded in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez had been in protective custody for five years, was sent
to the Tucson facility despite com plaints that his life would be
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy director of the state Department of Corrections was dis
ciplined, along with three other employees. And U.S. District Judge
Richard Bilby ripped prison admin istrators, saying their
indifference to inmate safety was ``as close to voluntary
manslaughter as anything I have ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 290 state inmates have been classified as bonafide
gang members and housed in isola tion cells. But thousands more
form the web of associates that extends to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an estimated 700 state prisoners have requested ``pro
tective custody'' status _ apart from the main population _ be
cause they fear for their lives. The list includes not only former
gang members, but homosexuals, child molesters and snitches. But as
of June, only 418 beds were available.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stewart's system for dealing with gangs made him a
target.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, inmates identi fied as gang members must re
nounce their membership. Those who refuse are placed in solitary
confinement for the duration of their sentences. Those who acqui
esce must provide detailed informa tion, or ``snitch,'' on gang
structure and activities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the get-tough strategy, some say the gangs remain in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs the prison yards in this state? Any inmate _ and any
correctional officer who could tes tify truthfully _ would tell you
that the gangs run the yards,'' wrote attorneys Larry A. Hammond
and Debbie Hill, who represent Arizona prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decide where a prisoner sits in the chow hall, how much
of his `store,' or commissary, he turns over to the open
extortioners, whether he provides other `favors'... The `fish,'' as
every new inmate coming onto a yard is called, quickly discovers
who, from his racial or ethnic group, runs the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison gangs are a particularly difficult problem for law
enforcement because leaders are behind bars already _ often for
life _ so arrests and convictions have a negligible effect. And
moving them to new penitentiaries may only spread their influence.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 12 members of the Mexican Mafia were sentenced
this year for racketeering, murder, extor tion and drug conspiracy
that reached deep into Hispanic barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conviction of gang leaders who already were in the
state's toughest penal institution _ Eme, as the gang is called,
contin ued organizing local street gangs and levying ``taxes'' on
drug deal ers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is complicated by the difficulty in identifying gang
members.
</P>
<P>
   Haro said those with tattoos are relatively easy to classify.
Aryan Brotherhood members, for example, may wear their ``patch'' on
an arm, a knuckle _ even the penis.
</P>
<P>
   But that alone is not enough. Sgt. P.J. Ferrero of the Phoenix
police gang squad said members are ``get ting clever and not
wearing tattoos anymore. They have their gang tattoo, or patch, as
they call it, on a piece of paper they carry around with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the threats on his life, Stewart refused to back
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long had a problem with gang members victimizing other
inmates,'' he said. ``If you have a threat from an individual then
you can separate that individual and the threat is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's a gang then it's difficult to place a person
anywhere in a system where you can ensure the gang can't get to
them. When you are on a gang's hit list, you are in trouble.'' &QL;

<P>
   Delta Air Lines' business class will be in a state of flux from
now until next summer on flights to Europe, Asia and Brazil as the
company phases in a new service called Business Elite.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing both first class and existing business class on those
routes, Business Elite is described as a premium service at
business-class fares. It will feature new sleeper seats with more
leg room than the old business class; the seats will have electric
controls for reclining and other adjustments, and personal video
screens. They will also have hookups for laptop computers, and no
passenger will be more than a seat away from an aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is reconfiguring 57 planes and will also have the
new seating on 14 Boeing 777s scheduled for delivery starting in
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking customers to pardon our dust while we make the
conversion,'' said Katie Moussouri, a Delta spokeswoman. ``They may
have inconsistent experiences on Delta.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline stopped selling first-class tickets on the affected
routes this month, and passengers who buy business-class tickets
while the transition takes place may wind up in first-class seats,
in the old business-class seats, or in one of the reconfigured
cabins.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, cabin service will be the same as in Delta's old
business class until spring, when a new Business Elite meal service
will offer a choice of four entrees (including a vegetarian option)
and a self-service snacking station.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to the gradual transition was to have 57 planes
on the ground being reconfigured simultaneously, Ms. Moussouri
said, adding: ``Our financial guys wouldn't let us do that. Our
customers wouldn't like it either. It would be a big change in our
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline decided to introduce the new service, which is
costing about $314 million, because of the larger size and faster
growth of the business-class market, compared with first class, Ms.
Moussouri said.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   The 234-room Marriott Royal Hotel, set to open Jan. 12 with 234
rooms near the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, will be the third in a
troika of Marriott hotels in the Russian capital. The others are
the 392-room Moscow Marriott Grand and the 162-room Marriott
Tverskaya. Operated by Interstate Hotels Corp., the three hotels
are owned by Mospromstroy, a Moscow construction company. Each
hotel has a health club, business center and meeting facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the outlook for luxury hotels in Moscow given
Russia's economic woes, Jeroen Gerrese, general manager of the
Marriott Royal, said: ``There is certainly room at the top in spite
of recessionary times. Business travel to Moscow still takes
place.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``We have our challenges, no question about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitness in Pennsylvania
</P>
<P>
   Airport Fitness, a Dayton, Ohio, company that operates a health
club in Pittsburgh International Airport, plans to open its second
club next year, in Philadelphia. The Pittsburgh club, beneath the
airport concourse, has treadmills, a Versaclimber, stair steppers,
rowers, bicycles and weight equipment. Single visits cost $11.25.
Michael Michno, the company's founder, said he hoped for an opening
in July at Philadelphia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards Revamped
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide will begin a new
frequent-guest program, called Starwood Preferred Guest, in
February. Members of Sheraton Club International and Westin Premier
programs, which the new program will replace, will automatically be
enrolled. (Starwood earlier this year acquired Westin Hotels and
ITT, the owner of Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos.)
</P>
<P>
   The program will allow members to accumulate points and redeem
awards at more than 550 hotels around the world.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Delays Rule Change
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has delayed its planned reduction
in the reimbursement rate for business driving, after objections
from several companies that wanted more time to convert computer
software.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction from the current rate of 32.5 cents a mile to 31
cents for employees who drive personal cars for work was scheduled
to take effect this Friday, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRS decided earlier this month to postpone the effective
date until April 1 to give businesses time to reprogram computers
and change employee manuals.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are behind the proposed reduction: the falling price
of gasoline resulting from low inflation, and slow depreciation
rates for automobiles, which are holding their value longer, an IRS
spokesman said.

TY TY, Georgia: long time.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Similarly, Perry recalled getting a telephone call two years ago
from a friend who urged him to support Bishop's Republican
opponent. ``He said, `What would your Daddy say if he knew you were
voting for a black person?''' Perry said. ``I said, `Well, he would
think I was pretty smart if he knew the man was helping us.'''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the message that Bishop, 51, has promoted in
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who never would have imagined voting for me,
who didn't vote for me the first time,'' he said. ``But the
majority vote their pocketbooks. They understand the precarious
situation that the farming community is in and they'll support
people that help them.'' He added, ``That was actually the key
element of Dr. King's dream, that blacks could be known by the
content of their character rather than the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine blacks were elected to Congress from majority white
districts this year, including several, like Rep. Cynthia McKinney
of suburban Atlanta and Melvin Watt of Charlotte, N.C., who won
with notable white support. But none won in a more unlikely place
than the 2nd District of Georgia. Only 36 percent of the district's
registered voters are black. The largest city, Albany, has but
78,000 residents. While the 31-county district remains marginally
Democratic, whites now support Republicans regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape here is a patchwork of pecan groves, cotton and
peanut fields and quail-hunting plantations interspersed with small
towns built around courthouse squares and cotton gins. This time of
year, with the cotton crop just in, white tufts litter the
roadsides. Blue harvesters churn through the pecan groves, sucking
fallen nuts off the ground and spewing out a mulch of twigs and
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this land was first cleared and planted by slaves, and
the phrase ``plantation mentality'' still resonates with many
blacks. It was in Albany, where asphalt turned to dirt when white
neighborhoods turned to black, that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. encountered some of the staunchest resistance to the civil
rights movement. And while south Georgia now has black police
chiefs and county commissioners, time has not eased all tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, for instance, whites and blacks have feuded over
whether to rename Jefferson Street for King. A black-majority City
Commission approved the change in 1996. Two months after the signs
went up, a newly elected white-majority commission ordered them
down.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are signs of increasing sensitivity. A new
civil-rights museum in Albany opened in November with biracial
backing. A number of the city's civic leaders have started to meet
regularly to discuss racial issues, with one group calling itself
White Men Coming to Terms With Our Own Racism.
</P>
<P>
   But churches and country clubs remain largely segregated, and
whites tend to move out of neighborhoods that become more than 20
percent black, said Michael Rogers, a business professor at Albany
State University who leads the city's Coalition for Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And blacks in the 2nd District, the poorest district in the
state, are nearly twice as likely as whites to have dropped out of
school, more than three times as likely to live in poverty and more
than 10 times as likely to live in homes without adequate plumbing,
census figures show.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Bishop might not seem a natural fit with the farmers
of southwest Georgia. He was raised in Mobile, Ala., the son of a
black college president who demanded that his students register to
vote. At age 10, he defied a Mobile bus driver by sitting in the
whites-only section of an otherwise empty bus.
</P>
<P>
   At Morehouse College in Atlanta, Bishop became an admirer of
King, the school's most famous graduate. He marched in a downtown
civil-rights demonstration, served as student-body president in
1968, the year that King was assassinated, and sang with the
Morehouse glee club at his funeral. After graduating from Emory Law
School, he joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
New York City, and later accepted NAACP help in establishing a
civil-rights law firm in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop served in Georgia's General Assembly from 1977 to 1992,
the year he first ran for Congress. The state legislature,
encouraged by the Bush administration to create majority black
districts, had designed a 2nd District where the voting-age
population was 52 percent black. Bishop defeated a vulnerable white
incumbent in the Democratic primary, and then cruised to victory in
the general election. He won re-election easily in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, however, new lines had been drawn by federal judges
after the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to use
race as a dominant factor in redistricting. By redrawing the lines
to eliminate concentrations of blacks in Macon and Columbus, where
Bishop lived, the judges reduced the district's black voting-age
population to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop moved to Albany and won anyway, with 54 percent of the
vote and an estimated 36 percent of the white vote. This year,
against a capable and adequately financed Republican opponent, Joe
McCormick, he polled even better, winning 57 percent of the total
vote, an estimated 38 percent of the white vote and 98 percent of
the black vote, according to an analysis by Charles Bullock, a
University of Georgia political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop did not, however, do as well with white voters as did
some white Democratic candidates. For example, in the 12 Colquitt
County precincts where at least 90 percent of the registered voters
were white, Gov.-elect Roy Barnes won 53 percent of the vote and
Bishop won 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, A. Lee Parks Jr., the Atlanta lawyer who successfully
challenged the racial foundation of Georgia's redistricting plan,
said that Bishop proved that blacks could be elected to Congress
``without racially biased districts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanford actually represents people without regard to race, and
when he does that people forget his race,'' Parks said. Many black
politicians, he said, alienate white voters by ``communicating that
they prefer their black constituents, that their priority is
serving their black constituents. Often that's what polarizes
elections on racial lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of race-based redistricting counter that voting
remained racially polarized in Bishop's last two elections. And
they emphasize that a crucial advantage for candidates like Bishop
was that he was first elected in a majority black district and then
took the benefits of incumbency to his new white district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to conclude that we are suddenly a race-blind
electorate,'' said Laughlin McDonald, director of the Southern
office of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the farmer from Moultrie, put it a different way. ``We
haven't arrived yet,'' he said. ``I don't know if you ever arrive,
if you ever wipe every vestige from your mind. But what's most
important sometimes is what direction you're going.''

DISNEY IS MONEY-MAKING STUDIO SUPREME FOR 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Mickey's got bragging rights for another year
as the king of Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an asteroid (``Armageddon''), a Chinese heroine
(``Mulan''), an unlikely football star (``The Waterboy'') and a
bunch of bugs (``A Bug's Life''), Walt Disney Co. will edge
Paramount by $18 million to become 1998's domestic box office
champ.
</P>
<P>
   The victory _ Disney's fourth in five years _ is sweet because
the entertainment giant did not move into first until last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real `Rocky' story for us,'' said distribution
chief Phil Barlow. ``We had a hell of a comeback. We had four very
weak months at the start of the year with $90 million going into
May, but once we released `The Horse Whisperer,' we came on very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is expect to finish with $1.103 billion in gross domestic
receipts. Paramount's final total will be $1.085 billion, with
better than 40 percent of that coming from ``Titanic's'' 1998
grosses. That makes 1998 the only time two studios have topped $1
billion. Disney passed the mark in 1994, 1995 and 1996; Sony set
the record last year with $1.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A strong late-year performance by Disney is no surprise. It
usually weighs its schedule toward holiday periods when
family-oriented fare _ ``Toy Story,'' ``101 Dalmatians'' and
``Flubber'' in recent years _ reach the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also credit Disney as a strong marketer. ``Disney is a
well-oiled machine with a lot of good product and huge
distribution,'' said Arthur Rockwell, a former studio executive.
``They're very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen 1998 films topping $100 million, four belonged to
Disney and two to Paramount (``The Truman Show,'' ``Deep Impact'').
``It's remarkable that two companies have done this much business
in a year,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its four hit films, Disney generated respectable
performance from ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Six Days, Seven
Nights,'' ``The Parent Trap'' and ``Enemy of the State.'' The only
true disappointment for Disney came in October with the
back-to-back releases of a pair of pricey projects, ``Holy Man''
and ``Beloved,'' that performed very poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Armageddon'' took in the highest gross, Disney's
most profitable movies were ``The Waterboy,'' which cost a mere $23
million to make, and ``A Bug's Life,'' with massive receipts from
foreign, video and toy licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which slumped slightly in 1997 with $880 million at the
box office, has maintained fairly consistent performances despite
limiting the number of releases each to year to around 18 in order
to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret is to have good moviemakers making entertaining
movies,'' Barlow said ``It would be even more enjoyable if
production and marketing costs weren't so high.''
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox will finish a distant third with more than $730
million, and Sony and Warner Bros. will each have about $700
million.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S REAL ESTATE MARKET UP ANOTHER NOTCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The median home price in the San Fernando Valley
rose 14.8 percent in November compared with the same month last
year, outpacing the county as a whole and highlighting both the
robust economy and tight housing market, according to statistics
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Association of Realtors, homes in
the Valley sold during the month for a median price of $178,000, up
from $155,000 in November 1997 and a $10,000 jump from October's
price.
</P>
<P>
   The median price is the point at which half the homes sell for
more and half sell for less.
</P>
<P>
   The area still is being squeezed by the lack of existing homes
and condos for sale, which is driving the median price up, said
Leslie Appleton-Young, the chief economist for the statewide
association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there has been a rebound in consumer confidence, and
the creation of new jobs and income growth _ both marks of the
area's healthy economy _ are being reflected in the local housing
market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year when we saw the heart of the California
housing market recovery move from the Bay Area down to Los Angeles
County,'' she said. ``It's kind of running its course in a
reasonable way.''
</P>
<P>
   The median home price in Los Angeles County rose 8.4 percent to
$173,500 from last year's $160,000. The market in neighboring
Ventura County also showed signs of health, with an 8.2 percent
jump to a median of $210,000 from $194,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1998 is turning out to have the strongest housing market
the state has seen in the past 20 years, Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But the association expects an 8 percent drop in sales and a 4
percent jump in the median home price in 1999, in part because the
economy will show signs of slowing as the manufacturing sector
feels the effects of a decline in demand for exports.
</P>
<P>
   Even taking that into consideration, however, next year still
should be the fourth strongest market the state has seen in those
20 years, Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's all relative,'' she said. &QL;

FATHER FAVORS SOWARD RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ The father of USC junior wide receiver R. Jay Soward
said Tuesday that he is leaning toward telling his son to return
for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Soward said he will not pressure his son to bypass the
NFL Draft and return to USC, but is currently inclined to advise
him to come back because R. Jay Soward shares those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to decide, not me,'' Rodney Soward said. ``But I know
what's best for him. We're interested in him being a productive
individual, not just to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with everyone from NFL scouts to agents, Rodney
Soward said he was assured his son would be a first-round draft
choice if he makes himself available for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't mean anything to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Soward said he planned to hold meetings next week with
some of those same people he consulted, but might cancel them if
his son decides to return to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just might have to meet with Coach (Paul) Hackett,'' Rodney
Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward did add that no final decision has been made regarding
his son's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says he wants to go, that's another situation,'' Rodney
Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Good as gone: The Trojans' chances of retaining linebacker Chris
Claiborne are not nearly as good. After an observer told Claiborne
he would miss him after Thursday's game against Texas Christian in
the Sun Bowl, Claiborne just smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Hackett said defensive tackle Aaron Williams
(sprained ankle) was sore Tuesday and remains limited. Linebacker
David Gibson and tailback Chad Morton, who also have sprained
ankles, have improved enough that Hackett said both will probably
start.
</P>
<P>
   Huge favorite: Hackett is astonished that the Trojans remain
16-point favorites for the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine a team as young as ours being in a position
to be that kind of favorite,'' Hackett said. ``We remember the Cal
game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC led Cal 31-10 before losing 32-31.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales: About 38,000 tickets have been sold for the game
at the 51,171-seat Sun Bowl. The last time USC played in the
contest, in 1990 against Michigan State, the game drew 50,562, the
second-largest crowd in Sun Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   USC has sold more than 1,500 tickets while TCU has sold more
than 4,000 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the turf: USC returned to the Sun Bowl on Tuesday
because Hackett wanted an extra practice on the artificial surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we came here because a lot of things are different
(than on grass),'' Hackett said. ``The speed and timing change.
It's such a difference from what we're used to.''

 &HT;    Highly-regarded athlete Porter collapses, dies
 &HT;    By Darryl Maxie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dante Porter left church just before 1 p.m. Sunday, to
take his mother to work and to attend a 2:30 p.m. memorial service
for a fellow Chamblee High School athlete, baseball player Edward
White.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, the basketball team's star, never made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a funny feeling when I didn't see Dante in that crowd,''
said Becky Chambers, who taught Porter U.S. history all last year.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks after committing to play at Furman, Porter
collapsed in the driver's seat while backing his car out of a
driveway and died. And in the span of four days, a happy holiday
season in Chamblee has turned more tragic than anybody could have
expected.
</P>
<P>
   White, an All-DeKalb County first baseman who was to play next
year at Georgia Southern, died unexpectedly on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Like Porter, White was 17. Both were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we had projected (White) to help us out,
pitching-wise,'' first-year baseball coach Steve Adley said. White,
an imposing 6 feet 4 and 225 pounds, batted .439 last year with
three homers and 18 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was a 6-2 forward who started four years for the
basketball team and was averaging 31.2 points through eight games
this season _ including a 56-point effort in an 81-76 loss to
Etowah at a Thanksgiving tournament. He led DeKalb County in
scoring (27.9 points a game) and rebounding (11.3 per game).
</P>
<P>
   He died of heart problems that went undetected despite three
physical exams in the last four months. He was the nephew of
Chamblee coach Perry Abrams and his wife, Julia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical examiner said he had an enlarged heart,'' Julia
Abrams said, ``and we never knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter had a heart murmur since he was a young boy, but it was
never considered serious, and doctors said it was something that
might pass as he grew bigger and stronger. Perry Abrams said he
never took any problem lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could've figured this,'' the coach said. ``He had
three physicals, man. I checked. I looked. When I was growing up
and going out for the basketball team, James Tate fell slap out,
died of a heart attack. That stuck with me all my life, so I'm
overly careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even experts on enlarged hearts _ a condition known as
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy _ concede that the condition can be
difficult to detect. Screening tests known as echocardiograms can
reveal it, but because the test costs between $400 and $800, it's
seldom given unless a doctor knows to look for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably only pick up one case in a thousand kids,''
said Dr. Bruce Brundage, a cardiologist in Bend, Ore., and a
spokesman for the American Heart Association. ``The only time we
recommend screening (for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) is if someone
in your family has it.''

OUTCASTS AT THE BLUE WALL: POLICE WHO INFORM ON CORRUPT PEERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST NEW YORK, N.J. _ On a sunny afternoon four years ago,
Richard Rivera stood up from his couch, blew a tense stream of air
between his lips, picked up the telephone and changed his life
forever.
</P>
<P>
   He called the FBI to say that the West New York Police
Department, where he worked as a police officer, was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   For months, he had heard the rumors and seen the indications in
this town of 37,000 people across the Hudson River from
mid-Manhattan. Brothels flourished. Illegal after-hours clubs
stayed open. Gambling parlors were never raided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had to ask myself,'' he said, ``whether I could let
the corruption just go on, or whether something had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rivera, who comes from a family of police officers, said he
did something many officers would never do. He offered to work with
the FBI to gather information on his corrupt colleagues and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial contact with the FBI, Rivera said he embarked
on an 18-month undercover journey into the criminal underbelly of
West New York, posing as a crooked officer, taking bribes from
businessmen and wearing a body wire to tape shopkeepers and tavern
owners, some of whom he had known his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   He spent hours reviewing taped transcripts, and said he was so
highly esteemed by federal investigators that one official told him
he had done as much work in his first six months as three full-time
agents. (The FBI has refused to confirm or deny whether Rivera
engaged in undercover work.)
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's call to the FBI ignited the largest police-corruption
investigation in New Jersey history, which has resulted in the
indictment of 34 people in West New York, including the chief of
police, on charges that included taking bribes to protect
prostitution; illegal gambling; illicit liquor sales, and extorting
money from towing companies. Twenty-two people, including the
chief, have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In the courthouse, officers like Rivera are known as
confidential informants. But in the station house, they are known
as Serpicos (after the officer who exposed extensive corruption
among the New York City police in the early 1970s), rats and cheese
eaters. In most cases, police officers who go undercover to catch
their colleagues in wrongdoing have no choice. Most have committed
crimes themselves, and strap on body wires to please the
authorities and reduce whatever penalties they face.
</P>
<P>
   But a rare handful, like Rivera, come forward of their own
accord. Untouched by allegations of corruption, these officers are
driven by forces from altruism to a simple desire to know whether
corruption really exists. If their motives vary, the consequences
rarely do. They often receive harassment and death threats. They
are sometimes fired by the very police departments they put
themselves at risk to help.
</P>
<P>
   Since making that call in 1994, Rivera said, he has been
threatened by fellow officers and has moved a half-dozen times out
of fear for his safety. Most cruelly, he said, he was dismissed
from his job in July 1996. He said police officials fired him in
retaliation for his undercover work. Town officials, however, said
Rivera was fired over several disciplinary charges, including an
accusation that he asked for a bribe from a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say these honest police officers often suffer
terrible pangs of guilt even as they uphold the law, and contend
that calling an officer who helps the government an informant or a
rat reverses the true nature of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It buys into police culture, the darkest side of it, to call
them informants,'' said Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of New York, whose office is preparing to
prosecute several New York City officers who are accused of
torturing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, and then trying to
cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Informant, in the vernacular of the street, connotes
betrayal,'' Carter said. ``But when a police officer bears witness,
it's not betrayal. It's honoring an oath of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having volunteered for the job, Rivera said, he is still
surprised that he was able to turn his back on people he had known
since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined myself betraying another police officer,'' he
wrote in an account of his experience that appeared in Law
Enforcement News, a publication of the John Jay College of Criminal
Justice, ``until I discovered that it was me, along with law
enforcement and the general public, who was actually being
betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many police officers are willing to pay the price of honor.
``I think the best that can be said, given the culture of police
work,'' Carter said, ``is that there are police officers who are
prepared, if asked, to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One is Laurie Calvert, who was a paid auxiliary police officer
in Palisades Park, when the Bergen County prosecutor's office asked
her in 1995 to wear a body wire to tape several officers in her
department suspected of committing a series of burglaries. Ms.
Calvert was in a good position to gather information: she had been
socializing with police officers since she was a teen-ager, when
she kept score for the department's softball team.
</P>
<P>
   She said she initially agreed to wear a wire to determine the
truth of the charges against a few of her friends. But once she
started, she wrote in a letter describing her experiences, ``It
snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she was wearing a body wire to tape conversations with
several officers, their spouses, even their spouses' friends. Once,
Ms. Calvert said, she took the keys to a department squad car from
the station house, ran across the street to have them copied at a
hardware store and returned them before anyone noticed they were
missing. Prosecutors needed the keys, she said, to bug the squad
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spying on my friends and ratting them out almost every
day,'' she said, and the guilt preyed on her mind. ``I always
thought I would lie or die for my friends. I never thought the day
would come when I'd actually become a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   But as her undercover work increased, so did the threats against
her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that late one night, during the investigation, she was
drinking coffee with several officers in the station house when one
began complaining that he had found some squirrels and groundhogs
digging up the grass in his backyard. The officer then turned to
Ms. Calvert, she recalled, and asked where he might find a rifle to
shoot the pests.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to dissuade him from violence, the officer looked
her in the eye, she said, and told her in an icy voice, ``I just
want to send a message to all the rats, rodents and varmints out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calvert, who was never a suspect in the burglary
investigation that led to convictions or guilty pleas from five
Palisades Park officers, now wonders if it was a mistake to help
prosecutors. ``I had nothing to gain,'' she said, ``and everything
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rivera, she has lost her police job and her reputation, and
has suffered physically and mentally. Most days, she said, she is
too depressed to rise before noon.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems are common among police officers who turn in peers
suspected of corruption, law enforcement experts say, and that they
are brought on by upholding the law can be cold comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always worth it to be at peace with yourself,'' Frank
Serpico said in a telephone interview. ``But sometimes you realize
that to do the right thing you have to go against the system. It
takes a strong character to go against a system of beliefs that is
a total lie, especially when you're the one left holding the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Rivera sued the town of West New York and its
municipal officials, seeking $17 million in damages and his job
back. Ms. Calvert said she planned to renew her own lawsuit for
wrongful dismissal against the town of Palisades Park. (She allowed
the suit to lapse last year.) The borough attorney said he had no
comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's suit contends that the disciplinary charges that led to
his dismissal were a form of revenge by police officials who could
not attack him directly for cooperating with the government. West
New York officials disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think he was a good cop, and we don't want him back
as one,'' said George Campen, the town attorney. ``If he was out
there helping the feds, that's great. But it wasn't a situation
where we terminated him because of his actions with the feds.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he lost his job, Rivera said, he always believed that the
federal government would come to his aid if he were fired. But when
he told federal officials that he had been thrown off the force, he
said they told him it had nothing to do with what he described as
his role in the corruption investigation, which is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his most frustrating experience with federal
officials came, according to his account, when they turned down
repeated requests for a letter that would have stated he worked as
a confidential informer. The letter, he said, would have eased his
search for another job and given potential employers an explanation
for his dismissal from the police force.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Newark, which is handling the West New York case, said it is not
his agency's policy to admit the existence of confidential
informers, especially in a continuing investigation. Usually, he
said, such silence is imposed to protect the informer as well as
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera now spends his days working part time as an insurance
investigator, a job he says does not provide him with enough income
to pay his bills. Many nights, he said, he swings between
exhaustion and insomnia and suffers dizzy spells and headaches from
the stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nights when I sit up and think about what's
happened, what the future holds,'' he said. ``My life has been on
hold since this investigation began. I'm still in limbo to this
day.''

 &HT;    Against Cards, Smith could become playoff rushing king
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emmitt Smith has broken so many records during
his nine seasons in the NFL, he was unaware that another milestone
is within his reach.
</P>
<P>
   Smith needs 153 yards to catch Hall of Fame running back Franco
Harris as the No. 1 rusher in the history of the NFL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dallas Cowboys prepare for Saturday's playoff game
against Arizona at Texas Stadium, Smith took several moments to
ponder the significance of another record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take 149 yards and a victory,'' said Smith, breaking into
a big grin.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows his legacy in league history is secure. Winning
playoff games is more important to him than reaping individual
honors. Besides, if the Cowboys beat the Cardinals, he'll have
another crack at Harris' record.
</P>
<P>
   For players such as Smith and good friend Michael Irvin, the
playoffs mean everything in their professional lives. Both remember
the pain and humiliation of last year's 6-10 season. A year ago,
they spent the end of December cleaning out their lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming in, getting my stuff together, and
leaving,'' Smith said Tuesday. ``There was a feeling of relief
because of everything we went through. I'll put it like this: Last
year was like suffering. You don't want to suffer any more. You
just want someone to put you out of your misery. When it finally
ended, I was glad it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   With that failure behind them, the Cowboys are eager to return
to the playoffs. They are 12-3 in playoff games during the 1990s.
Meanwhile, the Cardinals have not been to the playoffs in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona might be the perfect team for Smith to play against. In
two games against the Cardinals this year _ both resulting in
Dallas victories _ Smith rushed for 118 and 122 yards,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas won those games by a combined 73-38 score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had success against them, but there's no guarantee I'll
have success again this week,'' Smith said. ``If we play like we're
capable of playing, with the line performing like it's been all
year, there is a good chance we'll all have success.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be particularly sweet for Irvin, whose string of 117
straight games with at least one reception ended the last time the
Cowboys played the Cardinals. Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman rarely
looked Irvin's way, partly because he was coverered by one of the
league's best defenders, Aeneas Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has accepted the loss of the streak. He did not accept his
team's absence from the 1997 playoffs, though.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, like Smith, has tasted individual success in the
playoffs. He has 83 playoff catches in 15 games, which ranks second
to Jerry Rice's 120. As he stood in front of his locker Tuesday,
the 11-year receiver reminded some bystanders about the importance
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was a shock when (the season ended),'' he said.
``We knew it was coming. We were on such a downslide. Today is a
stark contrast to the way we felt then. It's great now. Everything
is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Including a few records.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES _ One day after cornerback Deion Sanders visited a foot
specialist in South Florida, he was listed as doubtful for
Saturday's game. Sanders said the sprained big toe on his left foot
has not improved, but he wants to try to return to practice this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had the easiest schedule in the league, according to the
NFL. The combined winning percentage of the Cardinals' opponents
was .395 (101-155). By contrast, the winning percentage of the
Cowboys' opponents was .461 (118-138). The first five picks of the
1999 NFL draft will be taken by Cleveland, Philadelphia,
Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Washington. Depending on the results
of the first week of the playoffs, Dallas will pick between 22nd
and 24th.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 tickets remain for Saturday's game.

 &HT;    UT facing Bulldog defense in Cotton Bowl
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Greg Davis got a VCR for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Not as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   As a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, on bowl selection Sunday, the Texas offensive
coordinator quickly realized his holiday visions would not be of
the sugarplums-dancing-in-the-head variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out Mississippi State was our bowl opponent, I
thought, 'There goes Christmas,''' Davis said. ``There's a lot of
extra time in the film room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The basis of their defense,'' said Texas quarterback Major
Applewhite, ``is confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two seasons, the Bulldogs have run an
unconventional 3-5 set with a noseguard and two ends up front
backed by an inside linebacker, two outside 'backers and two strong
safeties (a.k.a. ``Dog'' backs) bracketing the offensive set.
</P>
<P>
   The key isn't the alignment. The key is the multiple looks the
Bulldogs give once the ball is snapped, with a variety of line
twists, and off-beat blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scout team probably had its most fun week,'' Davis said.
``We lined them up and told them to move to a certain spot at the
snap and let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State's hopes of stopping an offense led by Heisman
Trophy-winning halfback Ricky Williams and a potent passing game
rest on using its speed and as much deception as it can create. The
Bulldogs haven't been particularly stout against the run, allowing
147.4 yards a game, but ranked third in the Southeastern Conference
in pass efficiency defense.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lee Dunn, the Bulldogs' third-year defensive coordinator who
as one of the pioneers of the pressure defense built successful
units in stays at South Carolina, Mississippi and Arkansas, said
the Bulldogs' frenetic style is a byproduct of the evolution of
passing offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much choice,'' Dunn said of the move. ``People
give you so many four-wide (receiver) looks that you have to have
five DBs. It's really not fair to put a defensive end or linebacker
on a wideout.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he considered switching to a more conventional defense
to take on Williams' strong rushing presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to shelve what we were doing and change everything
for the ballgame,'' Dunn said. ``But we've had so many kids hurt we
had to shelve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to put backup linebacker Barron Simpson (5 feet 11
inches, 221 pounds) at linebacker alongside Edward Smith and Larry
Campbell in a 4-3 set, replacing one of he defensive backs. But
Simpson and Campbell have been hurt, forcing Dunn to stick with the
nickel secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have something up our sleeve,'' Campbell said. ``We
might change things up.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing they can't do is bulk up overnight. The Bulldogs
defense has a 5-11, 235-pound noseguard, a 176-pound strong safety
and and average weight of only 218 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a couple of engagements with Texas this week. I'm
sure they looked at our size and saw how small we are,'' Smith
said. ``I'm sure they think their size will make up for it. But we
have speed.''
</P>
<P>
   At South Carolina, Dunn's defense was known as the ``Fire Ants''
because they made up for a lack of size with a nasty bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard to figure out a nickname for this bunch,'' Dunn
said. ``They can make you feel wonderfully happy one minute and the
next minute you want to choke them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's hoping for the wonderfully happy bit, and his team is
eager to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams don't know about us,'' said cornerback Robert
Bean. ``Then they play us and give us our props. When we stop Ricky
Williams and the passing game, they'll see how good we are.''

OFFICERS' KILLING OF WOMAN IN CAR LEADS TO DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ A 19-year-old black woman was killed here in
a hail of police bullets as she sat in her disabled car early
Monday, a gun in her lap, leading relatives to accuse the officers
of murder and local civil rights officials to ask for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want us to march and protest against the
police,'' said Don Bardo, president of the Urban League of
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. ``But I'm telling people to
be cool until the investigation is completed. Let's not make the
tragedy any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That the death of the woman, Tyisha Miller, is a tragedy is
about the only thing everyone can agree on about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 2 a.m. on Monday, the authorities received a 911
call saying that a woman in a car at a gas station in Riverside was
asleep or unconscious with a pistol in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:01 a.m. four Riverside police officers, three white and one
Hispanic, arrived and tried to wake the woman as she sat in her
locked Nissan Sentra with the windows rolled up. A few moments
later, Ms. Miller was dead. Her family said her body and car were
riddled with as many as two dozen bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the shooting, police said that Ms. Miller had
shot at them once and, fearing for their lives, the officers
returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, a police spokesman, Sgt. Chris Manning, said
it was unclear whether Ms. Miller had fired. But, Manning said, Ms.
Miller did grab the gun after the officers smashed the driver's
side window to get to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continued interviews,'' Manning said, ``we weren't as
absolute that a round was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller's cousin, Anthonete Joiner, 18, who had placed the
call to 911, was 30 or 40 feet away from the car during the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner had gone to the gas station before the police
arrived, to help her cousin with a flat tire. But when she and a
friend arrived at the station, they found Ms. Miller either asleep
or unconscious, her seat reclined.
</P>
<P>
   The car's radio was blasting and the heat was turned to high.
</P>
<P>
   The police were unable to wake her, even after knocking on the
windows. They also saw the gun on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Butler, the cousins' uncle, said that Ms. Joiner had called
911, thinking that an ambulance would be sent to the scene, and had
no idea that the police would arrive instead. But because of the
report of the gun, the police came, Manning said, ``so that they
could remove the threat of a handgun, so the medical personnel
could respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Press-Enterprise reported Tuesday that Ms. Joiner
said her cousin ``was lying in her car shaking,'' her eyes rolling
and mouth foaming. Ms. Joiner could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that Ms. Joiner told him that when the police
arrived at the gas station, they ordered her to step back and
immediately began pounding on the window and screaming at Ms.
Miller to open the door. The next thing Ms. Joiner saw, said her
uncle, was the officers shooting her cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't a criminal,'' Butler said of Ms. Miller. ``She was
a young girl with a flat tire and she fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthonete is devastated,'' Butler said. ``She is so upset. She
feels guilty because she thinks it's her fault her cousin got
murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, whom the police would not identify, have been
placed on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of what
will surely be a carefully watched investigation. Two of the
officers had less than five years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside County district attorney's office is investigating
the shooting, which Michael Soccio, a spokesman, said could take
weeks. ``We will be attempting to determine if any criminal conduct
occurred,'' Soccio said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the yard and the street in front of the Millers' home here
filled up, the city of Riverside and civic officials such as Bardo
were working to calm tensions. On Monday night, Bardo, a
representative from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and several other neighborhood advocates were
briefed by Chief Jerry Carroll of the Riverside police on the
shooting. ``There wasn't a lot of information,'' Bardo said. ``But
there was a whole lot of gray.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, family and friends gathered in the front yard of the
yellow ranch-style house in nearby Rubidous and quietly talked
about organizing a neighborhood car wash on New Year's Day to raise
money for Ms. Miller's burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might as well have lynched her,'' said the Rev. Bernell
Butler, a friend of the family. ``This might as well be
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bardo said, ``Nobody knows what to believe,'' adding, ``I'm
not taking any side until I find out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a difficult year for race relations in Riverside,
a city of about 250,000 people 60 miles east of Los Angeles. In
January there was a bitter and embarrassing debate about whether to

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first official data from the federal government
show that most states are meeting the work requirements of the 1996
welfare law, with 28 percent of adults on the rolls participating
in some type of work activity, administration officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether states will be able to meet the more
stringent requirements that take effect in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare reform law was designed to promote work, and
that's exactly what's happening,'' President Clinton's chief
domestic policy adviser, Bruce N. Reed, said. ``More people on
welfare are working, and more people are leaving welfare to go to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The new data attest to the work effort of welfare recipients but
do not show whether people who leave welfare have found good jobs,
as Congress intended. Jodie Levin-Epstein, a welfare expert at the
Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group,
sounded a note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption that any job is a step up the ladder,
and that's true for some welfare recipients,'' she said. ``But many
people get stuck on the first rung of the ladder and remain in
poverty because the jobs do not lead to higher wages, even over
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   All 36 of the states reporting data for 1997 met the work
requirement, with work participation rates ranging from 13.5
percent in Louisiana to 96.7 percent in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law reversed six decades of social welfare policy,
eliminated the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the
nation's poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run
their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the law stipulates that adults must be working in no
fewer than 25 percent of the families on welfare, or else states
are subject to financial penalties. This figure rises by 5
percentage points a year, to 50 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, states get credit for reducing the number of
people on welfare. The federal work requirements are reduced, or
liberalized, for states that have reduced their welfare rolls since
1995, as almost all states have. Nationwide, the number of people
on welfare has dropped by nearly one-third, to 8.4 million, since
August 1996, when the welfare bill was signed.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many welfare experts doubted that the states could
meet the law's work requirements. State officials say doing so
required fundamental changes in the expectations of welfare
recipients and the culture of welfare offices, shifting the focus
from the issuance of checks to employment and jobs. In 10 states,
fewer than 25 percent of the adult welfare recipients were working
in 1997, but the states still met the law's requirements, because
these states reduced their welfare rolls and were rewarded by
having their work requirement lowered.
</P>
<P>
   States in this category include California, with a work
participation rate of 20.6 percent, Georgia (20.6 percent),
Louisiana (13.5 percent), Maryland (18.3 percent), Mississippi
(17.2 percent) and Texas (19.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Iowa, Oregon, Wisconsin and Wyoming were among the
``high performers.'' In each of these states, more than half of the
adult welfare recipients were working or participating in work
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Data for 14 states were unavailable, incomplete or unverified.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie R. Marino, acting commissioner of the Connecticut
Department of Social Services, said the state, with a 58.4 percent
work participation rate, had a strong economy and had helped people
move from welfare to work by providing Medicaid, child care, rental
assistance and transportation services. Ms. Marino said the 1996
law provided ``a sense of empowerment, allowing people to realize
that they could do something productive with their lives, and that
we would do something to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the metropolitan region, New York state, with 27.9
percent of its adult welfare recipients working in 1997, was right
around the national average, while New Jersey, at 20.7 percent, was
below. New York has about one-tenth of the nation's welfare
families, and slightly more than two-thirds of the state's welfare
recipients live in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   James D. Neely, deputy director of Oregon's welfare program,
said the state had enforced stringent work requirements since the
early 1990s and had spent ``a substantial amount of state money,
over and above what we had to spend,'' to help people move from
welfare to work. ``Anybody who comes through the door has to work
or perform some activity to get ready for work as soon as
possible,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, welfare experts said, people who remain on the rolls
will be harder to place in jobs because they have fewer skills,
less education and less work experience, and are more likely to
have physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, states will have more money to spend on
training and preparing each person who remains on the rolls,
because the amount of the federal grant for each state is fixed
even though the welfare rolls are plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Very few welfare recipients are exempt from the work
requirements of the 1996 law. States may, if they choose, exempt
single parents caring for children under 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon M. Daly, vice president of Catholic Charities USA,
said: ``If you, as a single mother, have one or two children
between the ages of 1 and 5 and you have to work too, it's very
hard. Often you don't have time for school or training, so you're
locked into a low-paying job.''
</P>
<P>
   The new calculations were made by the federal Department of
Health and Human Services, from data submitted by the states. They
are consistent with new data from the Census Bureau that show a
substantial increase in the proportion of single women on welfare
who have earnings from employment. Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for
the department, said the census data also showed an increase in
average monthly earnings for welfare recipients with jobs, to $592
in the final months of 1997 from $500 at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While most states have been focusing on the numerical goals for
employment of welfare recipients in general, the 1996 law set
separate goals for two-parent families, and many states have failed
to meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 percent of two-parent families were working or
participating in work activities in 1997. The basic goal, set by
the 1996 law, was that 75 percent of such families should have been
working in 1997, but the specific goal for each state was adjusted
to give states credit for reducing their welfare rolls. A family
was in compliance if one parent, or both parents together, worked
35 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 states reporting data on two-parent families, 17
failed to meet their goals, even after the goals were reduced.
Two-parent families account for a small proportion of all welfare
families, just 7 percent of the national total.

FIERCE STORM MADE RACE A STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to ADD background, details throughout; changes

(rl) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Christmas dawned bright and sunny in Sydney
harbor, creating a flawless backdrop for the start of the 54th
annual yacht race that runs from the shadow of the famous Opera
House to the island of Tasmania just south of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Powerboats by the hundreds bobbed through the blue water and
spectators lined the shores, the tens of thousands of picnickers
drinking beer or champagne as they waited for the noon cannon that
would launch the 115 yachts. The start of the race, which draws
vessels from around the world to the Southern Hemisphere, is
considered one of the most effervescent days of Australia's summer.
</P>
<P>
   The headlands a mile apart that frame the harbor were especially
packed in this year's 84-degree weather, and the crowds burbled as
the sleek vessels flowed out into the Tasman Sea, lofting their
spinnakers to catch the warm breeze. This year was considered
something of a banner start because _ for once _ none of the giddy
revelers sent a motorboat slamming into a yacht, knocking it out of
the race before it left the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But far worse than an inadvertent collision lurked beyond the
headlands.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, winds of hurricane force and waves like mountains
slammed into the tender thoroughbred boats, frequently sending crew
members into the chilly water, saved only by their harnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The wind howled with a ferocity that made simple conversation
impossible, and the cold, lurching sea prompted horrible bouts of
seasickness. By the time it was over, several yachts sank and at
least four yachtsmen died. Two more are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if I were on a wild bronco and 60-mile-per-hour fire
hoses of water were shot at me,'' said Bill Erklens, captain of the
80-foot American yacht Sayonara, the first to finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   Why did one of the five great ocean races in the world spin so
quickly out of control, forcing the largest maritime civilian
rescue operation in Australia's history?
</P>
<P>
   In part it was because of the unexpected fierceness of the
storm. Although severe weather was forecast, winds of 90 mph are
unusual for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In part it was because of the nature of the race. It is known as
something of a macho challenge, one of the few such races that
takes the boats out into the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, for some yachting experts, it was a sign that the
sport may have lost a sense of balance, with rich yachtsmen
ignoring the possibility that the ocean might throw up conditions
they do not have the experience to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some crews are more experienced than others, but there are
amateurs out there for fun,'' said John Rousmaniere, a boating
writer who is a veteran of the last major yachting disaster, off
England in 1979, when 15 people died in the Fastnet race.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, satellite images and long-range forecasts
have made weather predictions much more sophisticated. Many boats
now carry fax machines to get up-to-the-moment weather maps or can
see the latest predictions by calling them from the Internet. In
addition, experienced sailors can get a sense of approaching
conditions by the gathering of the clouds and the change in the
motion of the waves.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this year's Sydney-to-Hobart race, weather
forecasters quoted by The Sydney Morning Herald said that they
informed the race organizers 24 hours before the storm hit that
severe weather was approaching. But even so the scale of the winds
caught many by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would get much worse than 50 to 55 miles per
hour,'' said Roger Badham of Maritime Weather systems, the
meteorologist for 20 boats that all made it through the race. ``By
Sunday at 9 a.m. it was clear that it would be horrendous. The
land-based lighthouse reporting 100 mile per hour winds was
shocking. I was a bit nervous then.''
</P>
<P>
   Erklens, the Sayonara's skipper, described the conditions at
sea. ``A solid wave would come in the black night in unexpected
moments and knock you flat,'' he said. ``It hits hard and bruises
your ribs. One crewman broke his ankle when he was pushed off the
high side of the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sayonara's crew included its owner, Larry Ellison, chairman
of the Oracle Corp., one of the largest software makers in the
world. As he looked back on the ordeal, he said: ``This is not what
it's supposed to be about. Difficult, yes. Dangerous, no.
Life-threatening, definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Race organizers said it was not up to them to call off the race
as the weather intensified. For one thing, yachting rules generally
specify that it is the skipper's decision whether to sail or not.
For another, once the boats are at sea there is little that can be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you can go into the dugout when it starts to
rain at Yankee Stadium,'' said Rousmaniere. ``If you are 50 miles
offshore it would take six to eight hours to reach land. And in a
big storm it is sometimes more dangerous near land than out in the
ocean. You can get tossed up onto the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a tough decision to back out of a competitive event,
especially one that involved months of preparations and about 10
crew members apiece on the 35 to 80 foot boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race so people want to keep going, they want to get
there, they have their families waiting for them,'' said
Rousmaniere. ``People tend to be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But with waves running three and four stories high, towering
over the racing vessels, 70 boats abandoned the race and sought
shelter. Six were abandoned or sank and 39 finished the race. Among
those stuck in the tempest, Royal Australian Navy helicopters
plucked almost 60 people out of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   For some the help came too late. Three of the sailors were lost
from the yacht Winston Churchill, a 56-year-old vessel that sank;
two were confirmed dead and one was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Two Australian sailors were found dead after their yacht, the
Business Post Naiad, capsized.
</P>
<P>
   The other missing sailor, Glyn Charles, 33, was swept off the
Sword of Orion. He had been a member of Britain's sailing team at
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

MOST BOWLS SUFFER IN BCS FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At a team press conference in Century City on
Tuesday, UCLA's Tony White recalled how, as a budding linebacker in
New York and Texas, he dreamed of playing in every bowl but the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said, `I'm going to play in (begin ital)this(end
ital) bowl. I'm going to play in (begin ital)that(end ital) bowl,'
'' White said. ``The Rose Bowl was just too big (to contemplate).''
</P>
<P>
   I hope White's first Rose Bowl _ Friday afternoon against
Wisconsin _ will be everything he couldn't imagine. Just as I hope
the peewee linebackers of 1999 will hold the Rose Bowl in as much
awe as he did.
</P>
<P>
   But sadly, neither seems likely. And you can blame the BCS, the
first-year Bowl Championship Series, whose unintended consequence
is the dented prestige of 22 of the 23 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS, by letting a computer grind all season, has given us a
national-championship game at last. This time it will match No. 1
Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State on Monday in the Fiesta Bowl in
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   That once looked like a promising idea, at the very least a step
in the right direction, toward an eight- or 16-team playoff system.
But now we know the BCS system, as it stands now, is a New Year's
Eve glass of warm champagne, a net loss for college football.
</P>
<P>
   Because if you proclaim one bowl as (begin ital)the(end ital)
championship game, you turn the rest of them into a kind of
football NIT. Consolation prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by declaring that (the Fiesta) is (begin ital)the(end
ital) bowl game to play in, it does take a little something from
all the others,'' White agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, none of the Bruins is willing to say he's disappointed
to be playing in the Rose Bowl, although all of them regret the
loss to Miami that cost them a shot at the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose Bowl is still a big game, and we're playing a good
team,'' said Ryan Nece, another UCLA linebacker. ``I don't think
you can downplay the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a good game, too, with each team going to Pasadena
with a chip on its shoulderpad; UCLA because of the ridicule
directed at its defense, Wisconsin because of the general
skepticism about its 10-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rose Bowl (begin ital)is(end ital) being downplayed. So
are the Holiday, Gator, Cotton, Sugar and Orange bowls, not to
mention a dozen bowls that probably deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Or haven't you read?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's USA Today devoted a full inside page to four articles
on the Fiesta Bowl. Other games, all being played (begin
ital)before(end ital) the Fiesta, get a line each under ``1998-99
bowl schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's Sports Illustrated features a 10-page, three-article
Fiesta Bowl Preview. For other games, refer to ``The Week in TV
Sports,'' where third-ranked Ohio State is described as ``holding
fast to the slimmest of hopes for a national title.''
</P>
<P>
   Slimmest, or none? This year, if you aren't in the official
title game, how are you going to win the official title? And if
there's some unofficial title at stake here as well, then why did
the manufacturers of the BCS go to all the trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of the pure bowl system was that in most years
it kept more than two schools in contention for the national
championship _ at least through the New Year's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A school ranked as low as No. 3, No. 4 or even No. 5 in the
Associated Press and USA Today/ESPN polls could imagine some weird
combination of events that would get it to No. 1. Let's see, if we
win by 40, and they lose a close one, and they won big, and they
(begin ital)tie(end ital), and an asteroid hits the state of
Florida . . .
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to move on, leave those innocent days behind. Fans
demand a champion be crowned on the field, not in the fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. But can't we do better than this half-baked chunk of
fruitcake?
</P>
<P>
   Of course we can: Set up a playoff that restores the major bowls
to their glory by using them as the quarterfinal, semifinal and
final games.
</P>
<P>
   The major obstacle, bigger than the scheduling headache, is the
political power of conferences like the Big Ten and the
Southeastern, each of which will bank a projected $28-$33 million
in bowl payouts under the current system, hard to match even with
the TV riches a playoff should produce.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll bet that after this season, when the non-Fiesta bowls
get as much attention as a Libertarian Party convention, the bowl
promoters will be quite willing to make a playoff work. Even a
lover of bowl tradition has to favor a playoff over this.
</P>
<P>
   Nece tried to blame the slow Rose Bowl ticket sales on the fact
``you've got a president who's a little shaky and an economy that's
unbalanced,'' and on UCLA's disappointment in Miami and this year's
$100 ticket price. Why don't we blame El Nino, for auld lang syne?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's fall and the prices' rise have a lot to do with making
Friday's Rose Bowl one sick granddaddy. But don't be surprised if
stadiums are emptier and television ratings are down for most of
the non-title games across the country this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a full-fledged playoff is the only way to return
the Rose Bowl and its brothers to the stature that you and I and
Tony White remember. &QL;

TROJANS' LARRY MEANS BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ Around the house he shares with four other USC
football players, Lawrence Larry is the safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Rent check due? Lawrence will take care of it. Problem for the
landlord? Just tell Lawrence. Did somebody forget to pay the cable
bill? Lawrence will remind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Lawrence, we'd be in trouble,'' roommate and wide
receiver Billy Miller said. ``Our entire household falls apart. He
thinks he's the daddy of the house. He's like the brother everybody
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry just turned 22 this month, but acts with the composure and
style of a man years older. His USC career ends Thursday against
Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl, and he's handling it with the same
grace he does in most situations. Not too sad about leaving
college, or too happy to finally graduate. He's always on an even
keel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is everything comes to pass,'' Larry said. ``I'm
thankful for the years I've had at USC. Who knows about the future?
I live day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   It might sound like Larry lives in a potential Animal House _
considering he shares a large house near campus with Miller,
cornerback Daylon McCutcheon, fullback Marvin Powell and tight end
Lonnie Ford _ but Larry's tunnel vision toward academics will allow
him to graduate from USC in May with a degree in business
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with him four years,'' Miller said. ``We all joke
about how hard Lawrence studies in school, but whatever he does we
know he'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry's football career hasn't always gone the way he hoped, but
he's never let it affect him academically. It's an example of the
responsible nature he has demonstrated since coming to USC as a
prep All-American from Littlerock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very mature,'' USC defensive line coach Ed Orgeron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that a lot,'' Larry said. ``A lot of it has to
do with experience. I was driving a car in the sixth grade. I went
to clubs with my brother when he turned 21, and I was only 16. I've
already experienced a lot of things that most guys are just now
learning about.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times at USC when Larry could have transferred, or
quit, or complained to coaches. But instead he decided to take
things ``like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some adversity early in my career. My expectations were
high,'' Larry said. ``But it made me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the problems occurred two years ago. After making
an impression as a reserve defensive end during his freshman
season, Larry was poised to become a starter at linebacker his
sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, then-defensive coordinator Keith
Burns lost faith in Larry and basically shut him out of the playing
rotation. He appeared in 10 games, but had just six tackles his
sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good freshman season. Then I had a year where I was
missing in action,'' Larry said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns admitted after the season that he did not have confidence
in Larry, and the rift was eventually patched up, although Larry
never complained about his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The following season, Larry moved back to defensive end. He
seemed to find his niche, starting several games. He had his best
game against Stanford, forcing a fumble that set up a field goal
and recovering a fumble that set up a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although coach John Robinson _ and Burns _ were fired after his
junior season, Larry felt this year would be his best, in part
because he would get a fresh start with a new coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Only an ankle injury has slowed him down, but he
has started the Trojans' past six games and been one of their most
consistent defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence is a conscientious person and fought hard to come
back from that injury,'' Orgeron said. ``He's playing his best
football right now. He does a lot of unseen things for us. He's got
so much leadership and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't exactly be considered a star-studded career, but Larry
will leave USC a contented person. He doesn't think he would have
been happier at Notre Dame, or Colorado or any of the other schools
he considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been what I wanted football-wise,'' he said. ``I
don't look at my career as being miserable. I don't regret
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry wouldn't mind trying out for an NFL, World League or even
Canadian Football League team, but he's also planning to become an
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   He's already lined up investors to start a trucking business
that will probably be based in the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the first of many ventures,'' Larry said. ``I want
to start a trucking business. This summer. We're going to be
transporting sand and gravel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry makes it clear that even if he starts with just one
truck, he'll be the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan on being a truck driver,'' he said.

NEW SAFETY RULES MULLED IN WAKE OF N.J. BUS CRASHES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As investigators seek the causes of three serious bus accidents
in five days, federal regulators and lawmakers in New York and New
Jersey are considering tough new rules and enforcement measures,
ranging from requiring seat belts or defensive-driving instruction
to restricting drivers' time behind the wheel after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the heightened concerns prompted by the recent
tour-bus crashes on the busy route between New York and Atlantic
City, including one that killed eight people last Thursday,
transportation officials say that riding a bus remains one of the
safest ways to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas Eve accident on the Garden State Parkway was a
statistical anomaly, officials said: Nationwide, over the last
decade, an average of only six people riding on tour buses have
died annually in crashes, according to the federal Office of Motor
Carriers, which regulates interstate truck and bus companies.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 37,280 fatal crashes and 41,967 deaths on the nation's
highways in 1997, only 32 crashes and 41 deaths involved tour
buses, the agency said. By contrast, large trucks accounted for
4,572 fatal crashes and 5,355 deaths last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Office of Motor Carriers, part of the federal
Highway Administration, is revising its rules dictating how long
bus drivers may stay at the wheel before resting.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bus drivers must keep track of their hours at work, and
once they have accumulated 10 hours of work, not including short
breaks, they must rest for eight straight hours. But trips to
Atlantic City often include three- or four-hour stretches of work
with six- or seven-hour breaks between. A driver thus could legally
make an overnight trip from New York to Atlantic City and back and
then make another run to Atlantic City before being required to
take an eight-hour break, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A number of accidents on the Atlantic City route in recent years
have taken place in the early morning hours, including a 7:34 a.m.
crash Sunday on the New Jersey Turnpike, in which passengers said
they believed the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. State
police have not determined the cause of that accident, and they are
investigating a third crash, which occurred Monday night on the
Garden State Parkway near Wall Township.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brennan, director of the Office of Motor Carriers, said
that the numbers of fatal bus accidents were too few to be able to
draw conclusions about whether the time of day was a potential
factor.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that a study of 80 long-haul truckers in the United
States and Canada who were hooked up to monitors and videotaped in
their cabs had found that signs of fatigue, from drooping eyelids
to slumping chins, were most evident between midnight and 6 a.m.,
even if a driver was accustomed to his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circadian forces on the body are very prevalent,'' he
said, referring to the human body's natural rhythms. ``During the
hours of particularly 1 to 6 a.m., your body is telling you you
should be sleeping, no matter how much sleep you've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The office is considering several recommendations by experts on
sleep deprivation, Brennan said. It could set new rules according
to a 24-hour clock, to insure that drivers would reliably work the
same hours every day. Or it could limit, perhaps to 18, the hours
in a week that a driver could work between midnight and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency had been studying the issue well before the
recent crashes, representatives of the bus industry said they were
concerned that the spate of accidents could lend undue urgency to
the study.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Parra, director of the United Motorcoach Association,
which represents 760 tour bus companies, said it would be unfair to
tighten rules for bus drivers based on a study of truckers, who, he
asserted, operate under vastly different conditions. Noting the
paucity of bus accidents due to fatigue, he said, ``My question is,
`What's the problem that you're trying to solve?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last few days, lawmakers ranging from Sen.-elect Charles
Schumer to City Councilman Noach Dear, both of New York, have
called for mandatory seat belts on buses, now required in several
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is studying bus
crashes and preventative measures, is considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bus operators, again, oppose any changes, saying the relative
rarity of fatal accidents means regulators should not fix what is
not broken. Parra said there was no evidence suggesting seat belts
would help and even some indications that they could do harm,
especially with young children, whose pelvises are more vulnerable,
he said, to the strains of a lap safety belt.
</P>
<P>
   Bus owners, who could be required to pay the huge costs of
retrofitting their buses if the rules are changed, also say that
seat belts can be an obstacle in evacuating a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments are not convincing to lawmakers, however. Dear,
chairman of the Transportation Committee, who has set hearings on
bus safety for Jan. 27, said he anticipated resistance to a push
for seat belts. ``People come up with every story they can,'' said
Dear, who also advocates required defensive-driving instruction.
``But it's been proven, time in and out, that seat belts do save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the National Transportation Safety Board's bus safety
study, a team of five investigators has begun an inquiry into
Thursday's fatal accident in Sayreville, N.J. A spokesman, Matthew
Furman, said Tuesday that investigators had found two mechanical
irregularities: a jammed brake shoe and a push rod that was too far
from its brake drum, reducing the brake's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too soon to tell whether the two problems were caused
before or during the crash, Furman said, and investigators will not
determine the probable cause of the crash for at least six months.
Among the other factors being examined are weather conditions and
possible driver error.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, Democrats in the state Senate have used the recent
accidents to criticize Gov. Christie Whitman for her
administration's three-year delay in exacting tougher penalties for
operators of unsafe buses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Legislature passed a bill that would sharply
increase fines against unsafe buses from $40 to a range of $500 to
$5,000, depending on the infraction. But the state Department of
Transportation delayed implementation of the new fines because of
opposition from lobbyists for bus companies, a department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, the minority leader, a Democrat of
Essex County, said the failure to adopt the stricter penalties was
unfair to the 10 million passengers who traveled to Atlantic City
by bus each year.
</P>
<P>
   James Weinstein, who recently left a job as a lobbyist for
Mirage Casinos to become the state's new transportation
commissioner, said he planned to announce the new regulations next
month and implement them by spring. ``There's no excuse for it
taking so long,'' he added.

HANS OESCHGER, 71, WHO WARNED OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hans Oeschger, a Swiss geologist who sounded early warnings
about the risk that emissions of industrial waste gases might bring
on climate change, died on Friday, after a long illness, according
to press reports from Bern, Switzerland. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   He spent nearly 40 years in the Department of Physics at the
University of Bern before retiring as emeritus professor of physics
in 1995. He was honored for his life's work a year ago by the
American Geophysical Union, which awarded him its Roger Revelle
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Oeschger believed that the emission of greenhouse gases had to
be brought under control. To that end he pleaded for scientific and
political action and for international documentation of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   His specialty was isotope geochemistry, and he contributed more
than 200 articles to scientific publications. He was an advocate
and practitioner of ice core research in both polar regions to
track the world's climate as far back as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The American Geophysical Union, in its citation, said his teams
of fellow scientists and students ``pioneered many innovations,
which have led to a better understanding of how the carbon cycle
currently operates, how it might have differed during glacial time,
and how human activity might alter it in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The carbon cycle is the exchange of carbon between living
organisms and the nonliving environment. Oeschger's research
covered many of its vital aspects as he studied climate changes
occurring over many thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Snow that fell on woolly mammoths during the last ice age turned
to solid ice and remains in place to this day. Oeschger suspected
that the air breathed by the mammoths was there as well, trapped in
bubbles for scientists to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   He analyzed bubbles of fossil air locked deep into the layers of
polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica and developed new methods for
gaining information from the ice, including applying radiocarbon
dating to this process. He invented the Oeschger counter, a
contraption that measures tiny amounts of natural radiation.
</P>
<P>
   His work, going back 40 years, made him a world authority on the
greenhouse effect. While he hypothesized that recurring ice ages
brought drastic climate shifts throughout the earth's geological
history, his research indicated that carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere had markedly increased over the past 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Oeschger was born in Ottenbach, near Zurich, Switzerland.
He studied at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and
earned his doctorate in 1955 at the University of Bern, where he
became a professor.

STUDENTS AT HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS IMMERSED IN MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., N.J., Wash.)  (rl) 
 By LUCILLE RENWICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excursion to a boulder field in northern Pennsylvania seemed
like any other field trip. Ninth graders from Ed Greaney's earth
science class at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in New
Jersey collected slivers of mammoth volcanic stones, measured them,
snapped pictures and recorded the rushing of waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the students were armed with digital
cameras, laptop computers, tape recorders and the technological
capability to transfer their information directly to computers,
capitalizing on their school's sophisticated use of technology. The
images are now on the school's Web site; they emerge in a 3-D
panoramic tour complete with sound. In the classroom, pairs of
students huddled before computer screens awash in multicolored
graphics as they clicked, downloaded and typed in the information
they had collected for 12-page multimedia reports on the field
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the computer a lot better than just the teacher telling
us or stapling pictures to a piece of paper,'' said Jennifer
Bastian, a 14-year-old in the class.
</P>
<P>
   At Hunterdon Central, in Flemington, N.J., cutting and pasting
no longer means construction paper and glue. The school is among a
handful nationwide that are infusing computers into almost every
aspect of learning. Multimedia software programs, once the province
of graphic art classes, are now being absorbed into every subject.
</P>
<P>
   At Napa New Technologies High School in northern California,
students take notes on computers at their desks and turn in
assignments on disk or by e-mail. In the Olympia, Wash., school
district, students coach teachers in new technologies. In Tucson,
Ariz., students design the layout of computer labs and create and
maintain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology sucks the students in to the point where they
end up doing additional research and more work on a project simply
because it's fun,'' said Pamela Lee Hopkins, an English teacher who
leads the Tucson program.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Harper of the Olympia school district agreed. ``If we're
training kids to be the future workers in the 2060s, then we've got
to at least move beyond the teaching tools of the 1960s and reach
them on a level and with materials they're used to,'' he said.
``And that's computers and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Salpeter, editor of Technology and Learning magazine, says
that Hunterdon, Tucson, Olympia and Napa are among only 20 to 30
high schools in the United States using computer technology. Most
schools are just beginning to delve beyond word processing and
surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon Central officials began in 1990 with a plan to embrace
multimedia technology, which combines text, sound, animation and
still and video images. Today, Hunterdon has more than 1,200 PCs
for its 2,160 students. Every classroom has at least six computers
linked by a high-speed network. All students have e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Florence McGinn's creative writing class, which looks more like
a computer lab than a traditional classroom, is a hotbed of
experimentation. Two-dozen computers line the walls, and several
have digital cameras mounted on them for videoconferencing with
student mentors at Rider University, 30 minutes away in
Lawrenceville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGinn created the school's online multimedia literary
magazine, Electronic Soup, which some 50 Hunterdon students produce
with peers at Asbury Park High School and at a high school in
Bangladesh. The students edit poetry together by e-mail and digital
video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGinn's desk is an L-shaped workstation with a 21-inch
monitor linked to her personal computer. A second monitor connects
with each computer in the room so she can scan students' work or
the Web sites they are visiting from her desk, allowing her to make
immediate corrections or suggestions by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity of their interest becomes so strong that the
learning goes beyond grades,'' Mrs. McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner, Rick Morrison, 17, was revising his multimedia
interpretation of a poem he wrote using Milton's title, ``Paradise
Lost.'' ``You can convey your feelings so strong, even more than on
paper,'' said Rick, a senior who knew little of computers and less
of poetry last year.
</P>
<P>
   He slid a disk into the CD-ROM drive. The poem came to life in a
presentation that conveyed a feeling of isolation. Images of Rick's
face and body swirled around the screen, superimposed on backdrops
of New York City and a deserted beach and accompanied by classical
music and the fading words of the poem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely more interested in poetry and creative writing
now that I can use the multimedia graphics as part of the
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neela Mookerjee, a junior in Mrs. McGinn's class, was also
relatively unacquainted with computer graphics in September. In
three months, Neela, 16, has become so adept at graphics programs
that she now opts for multimedia presentations for most of her
large assignments. In a project on censorship for a history class,
she created a Web site rather than a written report.
</P>
<P>
   In the Napa Valley of California, the idea for a
technology-centered high school was proposed by local business
leaders. Napa New Tech opened in 1996 with a $250,000 grant from
the federal Department of Education, plus help from nearby
technology companies. There is a computer at every classroom desk
for the 220 11th and 12th graders. Teachers recruited for their
knowledge of technology create lesson plans from online video
files, CD-ROMs, Web sites and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Students are assigned to unpaid internships at technology-based
companies in the Napa Valley for 15 hours a semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through technology the kids see what they can do differently
in school, and better in many cases,'' said JoAnne Miller, director
of external relations at Napa New Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At Desert View High School in Tucson, Ms. Hopkins' business
technology students often arrive with C averages, but improve to
B's or better, spurred on by the prospect of admission to Desert
View's business technology program. Financed with federal
school-to-work funds, the program operates like a small business
inside the school, a sort of internal consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cuban, a Stanford University education professor and
critic of education technology, concedes that computers engage
students around enticing projects. But he worries about a growing
technology gap.
</P>
<P>
   Computer access depends in part on a community's wealth and in
part on administrators who know how to apply for grants. Hunterdon
Central was blessed with both. The school is located in a
reasonably affluent area in southern New Jersey, and district
officials have been able to secure grants from large foundations
and companies like AT &AMP; T. This has enabled the school to pay
$40,000 per classroom for computer equipment, said Ron Pare,
director of information systems at Hunterdon.

<P>
   For nearly six months the 19 National Basketball Association
players on the union's negotiating committee have stood in the
background and flanked their leader, Billy Hunter, like a support
group with clinched jaws and firm stances. But now they have been
placed under intense scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee rejected what the owners say was their final
proposal on Sunday, Commissioner David Stern called those 19
players a runaway group who will be to blame if the season is
canceled Jan. 7. He also said they were holding the other 400-plus
members hostage and expressed thinly veiled suspicions over the
influence of agent David Falk on the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his remarks are unprofessional, and I think they're
beneath his dignity,'' said Falk, who represents three major stars
on the committee: Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Juwan Howard.
``What he says is out of desperation. It's like a player
complaining about a referee because he's losing the game or he's
not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stern is not the first person to have raised the issue of
how and why 19 players were granted the only authority to endorse
an owners' proposal and present it to their members for a vote to
save the season.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it was simple: In the summer of 1997, the union's
executive committee was voted into office by the league's 29 player
representatives. And Ewing was elected president. The executive
committee then chose a cross-section of players to make up the
negotiating committee from the low-end salary ranges (Atlanta's Ty
Corbin) to the upper-middle (Knicks' Allan Houston) and the
high-end (Mourning, Howard).
</P>
<P>
   This summer, when 250 players gathered in Las Vegas for a
meeting, a vote was taken to give the negotiating committee the
power to decide when and if to bring a proposal to the membership
for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been led to believe that if a player expressed that it
wasn't such a good idea, he was disciplined,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Players on the committee take issue with Stern. ``We don't
muzzle our players,'' said Danny Schayes, a member of the
committee. ``Stern is the one who does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the union said they wished Stern would have listened
in on the over 100 players who were on a conference call with
Hunter and Ewing on Tuesday. Union officials said that of the 30
players who spoke out on the call, 25 were willing to scrap the
season if the owners failed to move on their last proposal.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that even Karl Malone _ who has flip-flopped
on several issues this summer _ changed his view that the owners
deal was fair and charged that it was not good enough. Not one
asked for a vote, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been reports of players, some who wish to stay
anonymous and some, like Kevin Willis, very public in their concern
with the union's negotiating strategy. Several players, from John
Stockton to Steve Kerr, have been shouted down when they've asked
for a more pragmatic approach. Even those who believe the owners'
current proposal is not favorable and is not a deal that should be
voted on have concerns about the makeup of the negotiating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a monopoly _ in that the stars people listen
to are Falk guys _ it's not good for everyone,'' said Jayson
Williams, an All-Star for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Williams noted that the owners' deal fell well short of the
acceptable threshold for the masses. ``I wanted to be on the
committee,'' he said, ``but they didn't want me. They wanted all of
Falk's guys as the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk's name has surfaced through the lockout. He has been
accused _ and has even admitted _ to putting thoughts in the heads
of players like Ewing. And when Michael Jordan came swooping in to
stir up a collective bargaining session in November, Falk took
credit for it. But as far as leading the negotiating committee down
a destructive path, agents call that an insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disservice to Billy Hunter and the committee,'' the
agent Arn Tellem said. ``It shows a lack of respect for the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not as if Falk has not tried to wiggle his way into
the forefront of negotiations. He said he has asked repeatedly to
be part of the union's negotiating team and wants to pull up a
chair to the bargaining table. Falk said all requests have been
denied by Hunter and the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had more authority and influence,'' Falk said.
``David is accusing me of doing the same thing that he is doing. I
say this in a praise-worthy way, but if David weren't the ultimate
manipulator, why would he gag 29 owners? He assumes total control.
No one speaks without his direction. If David Stern wanted to be
candid _ instead of being incredibly political _ he would say this
is a negotiation and our sole goal is to significantly roll back
costs so that the owners can make more profit. His fight is not
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, Falk has been viewed as a hindrance to the
negotiations and as a shadowy figure lurking in the background of
the negotiating committee. In response to Falk's remarks, Stern
said Tuesday that Falk should ``stop professing his
noninvolvement.''

PLAYOFF PROTOCOL: PARCELLS WROTE BOOK

<P>
   You have heard the litany over and over: the pro football
playoffs are starting. It is a new season. The intensity level
rises. Players must rise with it or be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above are true. And many football people will say
that one other truism applies: No coach can get players to rise to
the occasion better than Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   In his 13 previous years as a National Football League head
coach, notably with two Super Bowl titles with the Giants and an
American Football Conference crown with the New England Patriots,
Parcells has made his players understand how to win the big games,
especially the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces the same task with his Jets, who take a 12-4 record
into their playoff game on Jan. 10, their first with Parcells as
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   How does Parcells get his players to become more intense?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Carl Banks and Steve deOssie, who played for him in
the past, and Pepper Johnson, David Meggett and Keith Byars, key
players for him then and now. They remember what Parcells did
before and think they know how he will prepare the Jets for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says you have to step it up a notch now,'' Johnson
said, ``but we've been pushing it the last five or six weeks. You
don't have to push any more. You know how long we've been waiting
for this? He won't let anybody slack up now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten better because we practice hard. A lot of teams
are like a country club. Our practices are physical during the
year. I remember Bill saying years ago: `There are 28 teams in this
league. If we practice harder than the other 27, we will win.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's rookie season of 1986, the Giants won Super Bowl
XXI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Simms and Harry Carson and other veterans told us then
that the intensity rises, the sense of urgency rises and it better
rise with everyone,'' Johnson said. ``Because if those other guys
on your team aren't fighting as hard as you are, it doesn't matter
how hard you're trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't there yet. We aren't anywhere. Joe Namath has a
Super Bowl ring with the Jets. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, an old Giants hero, is now in the Jets' front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``At playoff time your attention has to go up another notch,''
he said. ``It just doesn't happen quickly. You build all year. This
time of year he lets you know it isn't OK if you drop a ball, that
mistakes are not OK because it's a one-game elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll tell you he won't take a chance on you in the playoffs
if he's not sure. He'll say point blank, `If you're not ready, I'm
not going to play you.' That's not a passing comment. That's in
your face. If you're not practicing well, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks remembered his rookie season in 1984, when the Giants
played a wild-card playoff game in Los Angeles against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the punt-return team,'' he said, ``and I drew a
roughing penalty. Bill shot me a look and he followed me off the
field with his eyes until I got to the bench. Then he said: `You
sit there the rest of the game. Don't move.' I was sure I was going
to lose my job. He just wanted me to know penalties are
unacceptable this time of the year. I didn't ever want to see that
look again, and I don't think I ever did that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many fringe guys he's not sure of. He wants to play
them. He wants them to contribute and he may pressure them all
week, every day in practice to see how they respond to it. Dave
Meggett got pressure like that a lot and responded. So did Solomon
Miller and Stephen Baker, who made big catches. To a degree, so did
Jeff Hostetler when Phil Simms couldn't play in Super Bowl XXV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett said Parcells did not climb over veterans who had been
through the playoff grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some of us,'' Meggett said, ``he doesn't do much. He lets
you exercise your responsibilities because he feels confident in
you. He hasn't treated the younger guys different yet, and I'm not
sure if he will. I don't think they need a whole lot of minding.
Guys on this team don't. They've been playing big games. But Bill
Parcells is going to be Bill Parcells. He's a different coach at
playoff time.''
</P>
<P>
   DeOssie, now a sports broadcaster in Boston, said Parcells'
preparation involved a building process rather than flicking a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they played Buffalo the week before last, so
physically, that was a step up,'' deOssie said. ``He tries to make
you understand the closer you get to the playoffs, the more you've
got to step up, even if you think you have stepped up already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, he puts pressure on guys a little more. He'll rely
on Pepper Johnson, Curtis Martin, Bryan Cox and Dave Meggett, guys
who have playoff experience. He'll get them to explain to the other
guys what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   DeOssie recalled when the Giants won Super Bowl XXV in Jumbo
Elliott's second pro season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo had to play against Richard Dent and Pierce Holt in the
playoffs and Bruce Smith in the Super Bowl,'' deOssie said. ``I
remember Bill telling Jumbo: `What we do in the playoffs depends on
you. If you play up to your capabilities, we will win the Super
Bowl. It's all on you.' Bill was on him every day, and Jumbo
responded and dominated those three great defensive ends. Jumbo got
edgy, but you want your guys on edge. Football is not a game for
the relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars said that Parcells has made it easy to understand why he
does what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't keep winning in the playoffs,'' Byars said,
``some people say, `Wait till next year.' But next year never
comes. You've got to start meeting the opportunities now.''  &QL;

   Britain: Child Prostitute as Victim
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ The government issued guidelines aimed at treating
child prostitutes as victims of abuse rather than as criminals and
at marking their employers and clients for prosecution. The latest
annual figures, for 1995-1996, show that 177 youths under 17 were
convicted of prostitution and another 207 were formally cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Britain: Batons vs. Truncheons
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British police are being warned that the growing
substitution of longer and heavier American-style batons for the
11-inch wooden truncheons traditionally carried by officers has
resulted in an increased number of brutality complaints. The report
from the independent Police Complaints Authority says that British
police forces should instruct their members in restrained use of
the new weapons to reduce the possibility of serious injury.

   MADRID _ Spain's highest tribunal, the Constitutional Court,
authorized the release from jail of former Interior Minister Jose
Barrionuevo and his deputy, Rafael Vera, while it considers their
appeals. The men were convicted in July for their roles in a
kidnapping in 1983 during a campaign against Basque separatist
terrorists. The government last week reduced their 10-year

DESIGNING MEN: CAZZIE RUSSELL, FORMER KNICK, COACHES FROM THE
HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Students at Hunter College were making posters for
the game Saturday on campus. ``They'll read,'' Mike Brown, the
Hunter basketball coach, was saying recently, ``come see us play
Savannah College of Art and Design _ and their legendary coach,
Cazzie Russell!'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown considered that for a moment. ``Well, I hope kids around
here will recognize the name,'' he said, uncertainly. He meant
``Cazzie Russell,'' who played for the Knicks in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, and not necessarily the Division III Savannah College
of Art and Design, which is not quite as widely known as he is in
basketball circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the kids don't know about Cazzie Russell, I do,'' Brown
said. ``I was a high school student from Taft, and I'd go to the
old Madison Square Garden and with my student G.O. cards sit way up
at the top with my friends and cheer him and the Knicks. Cazzie was
a great scorer _ instant offense. I remember the chant _ `Caz-zie!
Caz-zie!' It's a thrill now for me to be playing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has moved around quite a bit since his days with the
Knicks. The 6-foot-5{-inch forward was traded to Golden State, then
the Lakers and ended his National Basketball Association playing
career with the Bulls in 1978. He has coached in the Continental
Basketball League and was an assistant coach under Mike Fratello
with the Atlanta Hawks. He coached the Centennial High School
basketball team in Columbus, Ohio, before moving to Savannah, Ga.,
three years ago with his wife, Myrna, a former Alvin Ailey dancer
in such Broadway shows as ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to
the Forum'' and ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russells reared three children _ all boys, all grown and
living in Los Angeles _ and Cazzie also found time to become a
Baptist minister, being ordained in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He is now 54, his hair shows signs of gray and he is not quite
as spry as once-upon-a-time after hip-replacement surgery a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coaching here,'' Russell said recently, by telephone
from Savannah. ``Nobody expects anything from us _ a team of
graphic designers, cartoonists, architects. We come into another
team's gym and they're going, `Yummy, yummy.' But we often fool
'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm looking forward to coming back to play in New York.
Love it there _ it's the No. 1 city for the greatest sport.''
</P>
<P>
   After Russell took over the Bees, who regularly had losing
seasons, his charges went 16-9 the first season, 18-6 the next and
this season they are 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great man and a great coach,'' said Richard Rowan,
president of the college and a former basketball player at Furman.
``The amazing thing about him as a coach is that, when he was a
player he was not known for his defense. But here, we win because
of the defense. He's a very good teacher, and he's concerned about
the whole student, not just the basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's co-captain and high scorer, Trokon Nagbe, a senior
art major, had an offer last year to be an intern at Marvel Comics
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean that he would miss a good part of the basketball
season,'' Rowan said. ``Another coach might have been unhappy. But
Cazzie said, `That's great. Go.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a question about it,'' Russell said, ``that's
what they're here for. To prepare for their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagbe returned this season to contribute to the coach's future,
leading plays in which they call out, ``Picasso,'' in a halfcourt
offense, or ``Van Gogh,'' for their press.
</P>
<P>
   Little else is fancy about the Savannah team's trappings.
Because of the demands of schoolwork _ Division III schools do not
offer athletic scholarships _ Russell says he may see his players
``maybe three times a week.'' There is no adequate gym on campus,
though plans call for one in a year or two, so the team practices
at either the nearby YMCA or the Salvation Army. Home games are
played in the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the NBA. ``What's this I heard about you
being drafted No. 1?'' one of his players said to him one day.
``Oh, I played a little,'' Russell told him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, their coach was the first player chosen in the NBA
draft in 1966 as a first-team all-American at Michigan. ``Red
Holzman scouted me and signed me,'' Russell said. ``And I played on
the Knicks' first championship team. No one will ever be able to
take any of that away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that he had, as he describes it, ``certain
limitations'' as a player. Mostly it was his defense. And he
eventually lost his starting position to Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I was traded, I was hurt, but I understood it wasn't
personal, and that professional basketball is a business,'' he
said. A few days after the trade, Russell sent a plant to Selma
Holzman, the wife of the then Knick coach, who was hospitalized
after an automobile accident. ``Selma thought that was wonderful _
it was so unexpected,'' the late Red Holzman had said. ``She loved
Cazzie.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has seen some of the people he played with and against,
from Pat Riley to Phil Jackson to Lenny Wilkens, become
high-profile N.B.A. coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any remorse,'' he said. ``Maybe I've been
overlooked. I don't know why. But I'm not going to lose any sleep
over it. I do know that when I was an assistant with Atlanta, I
worked well with the players, like Kevin Willis, helping to develop
his jump hook, and Austin Carr and Spud Webb.''
</P>
<P>
   Fratello, now coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, said: ``Cazzie
was with me about 10 years ago. I run into him on occasion and he's
just as upbeat, just as positive as he's always been. I thought he
was terrific with the players. And I liked a guy who had been on a
championship team _ who knew what it took _ to work with my
players. Why someone doesn't get a certain job and someone else
does is many times a mystery. There's a lot of twists and turns in
the coaching business. And if you want to stay in it, you have to
decide how choosy you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Hunter coach, said, ``I don't know Cazzie, but it's
obvious from where he is that his heart is really and truly in
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, Russell and his group of artists are devising
strategies and plays to deploy against Hunter. Who knows _ a
Rembrandt may come out of it.

BADLY BURNED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT EXUBERANT UPON RELEASE FROM
HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 (Also moving in the ``n'' California news files) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Patricia Farrell Aidem contributed to this
story) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leaving the hospital where he spent more than a
month recovering from life-threatening burns, Christopher James
paused, popped up through the sunroof of a limousine carrying him
home and pumped his fist triumphantly in the air.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of pure joy Tuesday in the middle a miraculous
recovery from burns to his face, hands and windpipe caused when a
science experiment went awry in November.
</P>
<P>
   With youthful exuberance, James, 17, exchanged high-fives with
friends and exulted in his recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. When I go home I'm going to have a party,''
James said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Carolyn, was more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put into words,'' she told reporters Tuesday
during a reception at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks
Hospital. She compared his release to his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than when we brought him home for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   James and two other Hart High School students were burned Nov.
25 during a science experiment on the Santa Clarita Valley school's
football field. Students were using cans to launch tennis balls
when methanol fuel used in the experiment exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said there was a chance James wouldn't survive the
third-degree burns sustained to his face, hands and upper body in
the experiment gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he did, burn victims can suffer so much
psychological trauma it alters their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Go tell that to James.
</P>
<P>
   When the young man was released Tuesday, he not only looked and
sounded exuberant _ but he possessed the same wise-cracking humor
friends say pulled him and them through the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they liked me but I guess they do,'' James
joked of the outpouring of support from loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, the Hart High School senior offered
thanks to his family, to God and to Jesse Honea, 17, crediting him
for saving his life. Honea threw James to the ground, putting out
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think personally it's made me a stronger person,'' James
said. ``Normally, you don't go through something like this _ so I'm
now a stronger person inside.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, doctors feared his vocal cords might have been burned
beyond repair since he had inhaled superheated air during the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   However, James' throat has healed well, evidenced Tuesday as the
young man fielded rounds of questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Leading surgeon Dr. Peter H. Grossman called James ``an amazing
man'' who maintained such a strong spirit he wound up comforting
his visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time ... when I wasn't sure if Chris was going to
survive,'' Grossman said. ``I wasn't sure. But Chris was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cake and punch party at the hospital drew a small
group of close friends and relatives. Friends gave him a
compact-disc player and a radio in the shape of a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Looking confident in a baseball cap, James' facial scars
appeared to have healed well, except for reddening across his face.
He's expected to return to high school and he plans to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, James and a few of his buddies were
whisked away in a dark blue limo to a party awaiting him at home.
</P>
<P>
   James' humor was little surprise to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Chris he's always like that. Even in the worst
possible situation he's cracking jokes,'' said his friend Ivan
Pecel, 17.
</P>
<P>
   James' neighbors posted signs on his street and at his house
welcoming him home to Stevenson Ranch, a suburb about 25 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Balloons were tied to his street sign and
giant greetings hung on the garage of the family home.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors checked in, elated that the teen was home
and showing good signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the accident, doctors began removing dead skin and
replacing it with grafts, covering the burns with cadaver skin.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said James will require continued therapy to help him
regain full use of his upper body, arms and hands and that he
likely will undergo reconstructive surgery on his face and hands.

managed to attract white support in urban, New South areas like
Atlanta. But Bishop's electoral success demonstrates that even in

but not one in which mortal elected officials would have the power

DOLPHINS BULK UP AT TACKLE FOR BILLS' VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The Miami Dolphins have been through an emotional
wringer over the last three weeks. Down, up, down. Now, as they
prepare for Saturday's wild-card playoff game against the Buffalo
Bills, they are finding two huge sources of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Their names are Richmond Webb and Kevin Donnalley. The two
offensive line regulars _ the 320-pound Webb at tackle and the
305-pound Donnalley at guard _ are coming off the injured list for
this game.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Troy Drayton's face brightened Tuesday at that
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys being back will really help us big time,'' he said.
``Webb is a Pro Bowler who always blocks well against Bruce Smith.
And Donnalley is Donnalley. He's scrappy and intense and he's going
to give 1,000 percent. Maybe we can get our running game going
again with them in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' running game, never that great, evaporated over
the last two weeks of the regular season, with Karim Abdul-Jabbar,
having suffered a concussion, missing the 38-16 loss to Atlanta
last Sunday. That has left them with an all-too-familiar problem _
relying solely on Dan Marino's passing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Miami totaled 62 rushing yards in its final two regular-season
games. Coach Jimmy Johnson is acutely aware that his team can't
live by Marino alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the running game, whether or not we're gaining yards,
has to be a factor,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not saying we're going to
gain a lot of yards. I'm saying we have to have some attempts
running the ball because if we don't, we're going to allow the
defense to tee off and rush the passer every down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened in last season's playoffs, when New
England sent the Dolphins home early, 17-3, as Marino was sacked
four times and intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
   Miami unquestionably has a better defense this time around. It
is first in the league in interceptions with 29 and rated third
over all. Even so, end Jason Taylor, who has 9 of the team's 45
sacks, will be missing Saturday. He broke his clavicle in last
Sunday's 22-point loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Dolphins' offense is more fit for the playoffs is
more debatable. The team's receivers have been widely criticized
through much of the season. That's what prompted Lamar Thomas, who
caught three touchdown passes in Miami's 31-21 upset of Denver, to
launch into a profanity-laced attack on a South Florida columnist
after the bitter loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're easy to criticize, because we don't have a lot
of big-name guys,'' Thomas said Tuesday. ``In a lot of games, we
were just being consistent and not putting up the big numbers, and
people were calling for our necks to be split. We're definitely
underrated.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marino, now 37, this is one more try at an elusive Super
Bowl ring. The National Football League's most productive passer
has played in 14 playoff games in 16 seasons, including one Super
Bowl, a loss to the San Francisco 49ers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you work all year for,'' Marino said. ``This is why
I play. And I believe we have a chance, I really do, if we can play
consistent. We've shown at times this season where we're a strong
football team and we can beat anybody. We just need to be more
consistent and understand what the circumstances are.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino now fully embraces how imperative the running game is to
Miami's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we intend on going deep into the playoffs, we have to be
balanced,'' he said. ``If you look at the history of playoff games,
teams throwing the ball 50, 60 times, it's difficult for them to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is a familiar and intense division rival. The Bills have
ended Miami's season three times in the 1990s, though they have
lost four straight at Pro Player Stadium, where Saturday's game
will be played.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dolphins have been anything but consistent in recent
weeks. A loss to the New York Jets started the roller-coaster ride
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Trace Armstrong, a 10-year pro, was asked if the
Dolphins are a better team than last season. He paused. Finally, he
said: ``I honestly don't know. We'll find out Saturday.''  &QL;

HE KNEW ANDREW JOHNSON BEFORE HE WAS FAMOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (See also BC-IMPEACH) 
(bl) 
By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Johnson, the only U.S. president other than
Bill Clinton to be impeached, is suddenly a media personality of
the late 20th century. Imagine what he would say to Geraldo. (``It
was petty vindictiveness by my Radical Republican enemies''?)
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, people are making do with Eric Foner, DeWitt
Clinton Professor History at Columbia University and author of a
definitive work on Reconstruction, the era of Johnson's political
demise. Foner knows Johnson better than most, and perhaps more than
he would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason they tried to get rid of him is that he was a
total incompetent,'' the historian said Tuesday, cheerfully, about
the nation's 17th president, who was impeached in 1868, then
acquitted by one vote in a Senate trial. ``But unfortunately, that
is not an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, he added, was ``a strange, strange person'' _ Foner's
book describes him as self-absorbed, lonely and racist _ who was
``really not that equipped for the position.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of Johnson's impeachment to Clinton's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are culminations of long periods of hostility,'' Foner
said. ``And the immediate cause, or catalyst, is not the real
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Johnson, Foner said, it was not his apparent
violation of the Tenure of Office Act when he ousted Edwin Stanton
as secretary of war, but the three years of conflict between the
president and Congress over what kind of nation post-slavery
America should be.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, he said, it was not the relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, but the continuation of the cultural wars of the
1960s _ the decade, Foner said, that saw both anti-war protests and
the rise of Barry Goldwater. ``Conservative Republicans have hated
Clinton since he was elected,'' Foner said. ``He represents
draft-dodging in Vietnam, he represents moral decay, he represents
feminism and the decline of family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Foner, 55, describes himself as ``on the left'' (he is on the
editorial board of The Nation) and says he has little respect for
Clinton. ``He's going to be seen as a big wasted opportunity,''
Foner said. ``I'm not a fan of his, because I think that his
personal recklessness has helped to sabotage whatever hopes people
had for his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Foner thinks that both impeachments were ``not the
right mechanism for solving these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Foner talked in his office in Columbia's Fayerweather Hall,
built in 1910 and seemingly not touched since. Foner, who has a
large office entirely lined with books, likes it that way. He
talked happily for an hour and a half, as rain fell moodily on the
red brick walkways outside. After the interview, he took his
11-year-old daughter, Daria, to the Christmas show at Radio City
Music Hall, and said he liked the camels.
</P>
<P>
   Foner's wife, Lynn Garafola, is a dance critic and dance
historian. The family lives in a big Columbia faculty apartment on
116th Street. It seems like a nice life, although Foner does not
necessarily recommend that spouses who are historians work together
on a project, as he and his wife have for an exhibit about 50 years
of the New York City Ballet at the New-York Historical Society next
spring. ``It's like playing mixed doubles with your wife,'' Foner
said. ``It's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Foner said he had ``a minor little career as a public
figure'' when he went on a tour promoting ``The Story of American
Freedom,'' his latest book. And now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, with impeachment,'' he said, ``I've had a new lease
on life.'' The radio shows are calling, and so on. His best-known
book is ``Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution,''
published in 1988, which won numerous awards and synthesized the
revisionist view of Reconstruction that began in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Johnson was not trying to carry out Abraham
Lincoln's magnanimous policies toward the South. Rather, Johnson
was a racist opposed to black suffrage, and the blacks themselves
were central actors in Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   One of Foner's lesser-known works is his five-minute version of
American history for the Hall of Presidents at Disney World. ``Even
Disney realized that the idea that the United States had begun
perfectly and was getting better ever since was not right,'' he
said. His version suggested ``that the history of the United States
is on ongoing conflict between ideals and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Foner learned that in part growing up in Long Beach, N.Y., where
his father, a historian, struggled to make a living by free-lance
writing and lecturing after he was fired in 1941 from City College
_ along with some 50 others _ for what was called ``subversive
activities.'' (Foner described his father as part of the ``Old
Left.'')
</P>
<P>
   Foner went on to Columbia, wanting to be an astronomer, but by
his junior year couldn't handle the math. At the same time, he was
inspired by a course he took in Civil War history, in 1962, which
made him realize that the racial crises of the time were rooted in
the events of a century before. He was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   How will historians look back on political America in 1998 and
1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton is removed from office, it will be a major turning
point,'' Foner said. ``If the Senate ends up censuring him,
historians will view the whole episode with a certain bemusement,
and will wonder how it got to be such a big thing in Congress for a
while.''

A CHARTER SCHOOL LEGISLATOR SAYS RELIGIOUS USE IS MISUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Ariz.) 
(bl) 
By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A legislator who helped negotiate New York state's
charter school law said Tuesday that ministers and religious groups
who sought public funds to establish charter schools on church
property were ``on shaky ground,'' and could easily run afoul of
the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan, who is chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, said it would be a perversion of the
bill for ministers to set up charter schools that would be in any
way associated with their churches. The Rev. Floyd Flake of Queens
and the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker of Harlem have both said they want to
set up secular schools, possibly on church property, with religious
instruction available before and after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff that Wyatt Tee Walker and Floyd Flake are suggesting
they can do, they can't do,'' Sanders said. ``You can't take
charter school money and put that charter school money in religious
schools that have unused space.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who pushed the law
past resistance from the Democratic-controlled Assembly, disputed
Sanders' interpretation. They said that while the law clearly
prohibits the public funding of religious schools, it does not
prevent a charter school from leasing property from a church or
from including ministers and members of religious groups in its
board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that even now, some New York City public
schools lease unused school buildings from the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
said his organization would monitor any church-initiated charter
schools on the separation of church and state. He said that
providing religious instruction outside school hours might raise
questions about the use of public money for religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that charter schools can't be a pretext for
religious indoctrination,'' Siegel said. He said the NYCLU would
also monitor the new schools to insure that they were not racially
segregated and that they upheld due process rights like free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   United Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said
Tuesday that she feared religious leaders intended to use charter
schools as a first step toward government-funded vouchers to pay
for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the ink being dry on the bill, someone is trying to
make this a subterfuge for directing funds into private schooling,
whether it's religious schooling or other schooling,'' Ms.
Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders acknowledged that ministers could not be barred from
opening charter schools. But he said the law specifically prohibits
private schools from converting to charter schools, and it sets up
a series of criteria to make sure a charter school is distinct from
existing private or church-affiliated schools. This includes
showing that each school has substantially different officers and
employees. He said this meant a janitor from a charter school could
not then ``walk across the hall and pick up the garbage from a
religious school.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake, pastor of the Allen AME Church in Queens, said Tuesday
that his goal was to provide strong education, with a curriculum
approved by the state, for any child, not just church members.
``Whether those schools are chartered under faith-based charters or
not is irrelevant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if charter schools might be racially segregated, he said:
``No more so than the public schools are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chester Finn, a senior fellow and expert on charter schools at
the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization in
Washington, said he was not at all troubled by the idea of clergy
starting charter schools. He said that if universities with
religious affiliations, like Brandeis and Notre Dame, are entitled
to public money in the form of loans and grants, then charter
schools should be also.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing about the charter phenomenon in
America is the number of different needs that it meets, the
problems that it solves and the opportunities that it creates,''
Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in Arizona, it is common for children in charter
and public schools to walk across the street to a Mormon seminary
for religious instruction during free periods.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter, a spokesman for the New York State Board of
Regents, which will monitor and approve charter schools, said
applications would be examined to insure that they do not ``allow
any inappropriate influence of religion.'' But he said the Regents
would not ``automatically reject an application from anybody,''
whether clergy or not.

GLORIA STRADTNER, 72, PROTECTOR OF ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Conn. ) 
(rl) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you saw her at all, you'd see her in a cemetery
late at night. She'd be clambering about one of those huge
cemeteries in Brooklyn and Queens, the ones beneath the flight
paths to La Guardia and Kennedy; graveyards with names like
Evergreen, Mount Neboh and Cypress Hills. She was there on the
hottest summer night when New Yorkers without air &UR; - &LR; conditioners
couldn't sleep &UR; ,  &LR; and she was there when the temperature was below
zero and the snow was hip-deep and nobody was awake.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the polished marble sentries guarding the dead of a great
city, Gloria Marie De Martini Stradtner looked only for life.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stradtner, who died on Dec. 22 at the age of 72, looked for
stray animals. She looked for the thousands of dogs and cats
abandoned every year by people who, having tired of their pets,
thought not of bringing them to an animal shelter but of leaving
them in a cemetery. Humans may think of cemeteries as woodland-like
sanctuaries. But for animals, they are only places to starve to
death in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But Gloria _ as everyone called her _ was determined that this
was not to be. Not for her strays.
</P>
<P>
   And so for 50 years or maybe more (nobody can remember when she
did not make the rounds of the graveyards at night), she would go
forth, lugging large bags of dog food and cat food and traps of the
type that cannot hurt animals. She would bait these traps and go
back to her car and wait. In an hour or so, she would return to her
traps. Sometimes, she would entrap a dozen animals or more in a
single night, her prisoners of love. And then she would feed them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stradtner never had much money, and so to supplement the
dog and cat food she bought with her Social Security money she
would take jobs working in catering halls, even when she was
getting on in years, so she could scoop up the scraps and bring
them to her strays. When she was younger, back in the 1950s, she
worked as a clerk and data entry specialist for IBM. But she did
not mind doing menial work in a catering hall. Not if it meant she
could feed the animals.
</P>
<P>
   And after she fed them, she would spend the next day making the
rounds of veterinarians, imploring their help to neuter the dogs
and cats (they usually charged her reduced fees). And then she
would visit the shelters, asking them to take and care for the
abandoned pets.
</P>
<P>
   One shelter was Pegeen Fitzgerald's Last Post Animal Sanctuary
in Litchfield County, Conn., near the Massachusetts line. They try
to specialize in housing cats there, but when Mrs. Stradtner showed
up with dogs from the graveyards of New York, they took in dogs,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would estimate she saved thousands of animals,'' said Jeanne
Toomey, who runs Last Post. ``She was wonderful. She'd name dogs
and cats in the cemetery and she'd bring them up here. Nobody could
refuse her.''
</P>
<P>
   She visited animal sanctuaries in Long Island, upstate and in
New Jersey, too, and nobody refused her in those places, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, her friends would go with her on her night visits.
Michael Puccino, an executive with a Manhattan computer consulting
firm, and his wife, Anne Marie, a veterinary nurse, would help
whenever they could. And the cemetery workers helped, too. When it
was bitter cold, the workers in at least one cemetery opened the
door to a heated mausoleum so the strays could spend the night
there. In another cemetery, they built little igloos in the
bitterest part of the winter, hoping that Mrs. Stradtner's strays
would use them to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Puccino told her more than once that cemeteries are not the
safest places to be after dark. But she scoffed at such advice.
``She was the most adventurous, the liveliest individual you'd ever
meet,'' Puccino said. When she was in her 70s, everybody thought
she was in her 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, somebody stole her car, which was parked on a
Brooklyn street near the house on Chestnut Street where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me, and she didn't care about the car,'' Puccino
said. ``She was angry because there were 100 pounds of dog food in
the trunk.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last summer, there was a dog she was worried about. She called
the dog Peekaboo because it peeked around gravestones at her.
Peekaboo kept having litters; one time, she delivered 10 pups. Mrs.
Stradtner was determined that Peekaboo be spayed, but Peekaboo was
elusive. She would come when Mrs. Stradtner called her name, but no
closer than 10 feet. Peekaboo was quite wild, covered with fleas
and ticks, and she trusted nobody.
</P>
<P>
   One day about six weeks ago, Mrs. Stradtner's speech became
slurred. Puccino spoke to her on the telephone and asked her if she
had been drinking. He knew she had not been drinking. She never
drank and had not smoked for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed with the Puccinos briefly, and Puccino had her
examined at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. Doctors said she had
cancer. It had started in her lungs and spread to her brain. Then,
she moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; she knew somebody
who worked there.
</P>
<P>
   She called Puccino on Dec. 20, two days before she died. Puccino
said she wanted to make sure that Peekaboo had been spayed (she
was) and that her own two dogs, Lance and Ivy, would be taken care
of after she died (he promised her they would be).
</P>
<P>
   People who knew her were not sure Tuesday about her next of kin.
She had been married to a man named Stradtner for three years,
maybe 40 years ago. They had no children. Her sister, Gladys
Semino, had predeceased her.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody found a poem she was believed to have recently written,
and at her funeral last Saturday, it was read. It was entitled
``Weep Not'' and began this way:
</P>
<P>
   Do not weep for me when I am gone
</P>
<P>
   For I have friends in the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   All the little ones I used to feed
</P>
<P>
   Will come to me in my time of need.
</P>
<P>
   They will purr and bark in great delight,
</P>
<P>
   And I will hold and hug them tight.
</P>
<P>
   Oh what a great day that will be
</P>
<P>
   When my furry friends all welcome me.

PLAYER AGENTS RIP STERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA players union is run by agent David Falk?
Hogwash. The union is only interested in protecting high-salaried
players? Nonsense. Players have not made significant concessions?
Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the primary messages Tuesday as three player agents
who represent primarily the NBA's lower class addressed a
conference call of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Glass, Steve Kauffman and Jerome Stanley _ all members of
the union's agents advisory committee _ pleaded the players' case
while shooting down ``tremendous misconceptions'' being promoted by
commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of agents _ who represent 33 players, only one of whom
makes more than $5 million a year _ said the union has conceded
most of the Kevin Garnett-type high-end salaries. What they're
holding out for, they said, are measures to restore the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stern) has the best deal he could have ever hoped for,'' said
Stanley. ``This is the first sports industry to cap the top-end
salaries. The top end has already been sacrificed. At what point
does it become enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the players' most recent proposal, players with fewer than
10 years in the league would be subject to firm caps on their
salaries. Players with 10 years or more would still be entitled to
earn whatever a team is willing to pay _ but even those deals would
be subject to a heavy luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   The union has also agreed to longer rookie contracts and lower
annual raises for all players, and the agents predicted a majority
of owners would vote for the union's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think David Stern a few years ago, in his wildest
dreams, thought he could get this (cap on salaries),'' said
Kauffman. ``This is a monumental concession.''
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point, however, is the union has not backed away
from its insistence on earning up to 57 percent of league revenues.
Stern hasn't budged beyond 53 to 54 percent, with each percentage
point representing about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the agents aren't convinced the commissioner even wants a
deal. Glass said he is baffled at Stern's stance in light of the
union's concessions and wondered if he hadn't decided long ago to
cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does appear to me, when you look at what's been given . . .
that they may not want to have a season. That may be a
possibility,'' Glass said. ``And I don't know what the reason is
for that. You'd have to ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the agents' comments Tuesday, Stern said, ``They
can say anything they want about me, but they are not neutral
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern has scheduled a meeting of NBA owners Jan. 7 and will
recommend cancellation of the season unless the union accepts the
league's current offer. Union leadership has already rejected that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the final offer has been rejected, I don't understand why
you need to wait until the seventh,'' Stanley said. ``If it's over,
then it should be over today, and if it's not over then everybody
needs to strap up and get back to work and lets stop the
gamesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kauffman, ``Commissioner Stern has to move an inch. . . .
He can't just sit up there in his palace and continue with his
condescending attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's threats, and his attempts to divide the union by calling
for a players vote on the league's deal, are simply part of the
league's strategy to extract every possible concession, the agents
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been a well-orchestrated, preplanned
negotiation,'' Stanley said. ``It's probably been in the works for
24 months.''

LIGHTNING UPEND SLUGGISH ISLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Not so long ago, the Islanders dominated the
Lightning. Really, really, dominated the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night they faced a Tampa Bay team that everyone but the
Islanders seems to be dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (9-23-3) has the worst record in the National Hockey
League. The Lightning had not won in six games and was trying to
avoid losing its ninth straight game at the Ice Palace, which would
have been two short of the NHL record for home futility.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was reeling, all right, but all the Islanders could
muster before a small Nassau Coliseum-like crowd was another
halfhearted effort that landed them a 3-0 loss and sent them on to
Chicago with a two-game losing streak after a 5-1 thrashing by the
Florida Panthers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After running off six consecutive victories against the
Lightning, many of them snapping lengthy losing streaks, the
Islanders (13-21-2) have dropped two straight to Tampa Bay, which
had last won on Dec. 9 _ against the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, which was without its sniper, Chris Gratton,
because of a suspension, was outshot, 35-17, by the Islanders, but
was saved by Bill Ranford's sublime effort in goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford was impenetrable, notching his 15th career shutout and
winning for the first time since Oct. 23, 11 games ago. His best
save came in the first period when he turned away Zigmund Palffy on
a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game was sloppy. Passes seldom connected. Shots
clanked off the back boards and the side of the net. But it was the
Lightning that made the most of its chances, scoring two goals on
its first 11 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier, the Lightning's talented rookie center and
the league's top draft pick last spring, scored the first goal 6
minutes 43 seconds into the second period. On a breakaway, he beat
Marcel Cousineau, the Islanders' third-string goalie, with a shot
through the pads. Lecavalier was dragged down by Islanders
defenseman Zdeno Chara as he released the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau was making his ninth NHL start because of an injury to
Tommy Salo and the ineffectiveness of Wade Flaherty. Salo has
missed three games with a broken finger on his stick hand; he could
return as soon as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy McCarthy, the Lightning enforcer, scored the second goal
at 14:29 of the second period on a power play, which was five
minutes long because of a flagrant foul by Claude Lapointe.
</P>
<P>
   The Islander was ejected for leaving the ice before slamming
defenseman Mike McBain into the corner boards. Aleksandr Selivanov
clinched matters for Tampa Bay when he scored a power-play goal at
17:42 of the third period. That fashioned a 3-0 lead, big enough
even for a team as poor as the Lightning.

REGIONAL BIA OFFICIAL ENDORSES PLAN FOR CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Buoying the hope that the Catskills may
someday be transformed from their Borscht Belt past into a gambling
destination of the future, a key federal agency has endorsed an
Indian tribe's proposal to operate a $500 million casino at the
Monticello Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo dated Dec. 9, Brenda Bennett, acting director of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs' eastern office, wrote that the proposal
tendered by the St. Regis Mohawks of northern New York State
``satisfies all requirements'' and would ``positively impact the
tribe and the surrounding community'' by creating 3,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said the casino would eventually result in ``4.4
million day trips to the area, inducing spending outside the
proposed casino of $337 million.'' In so doing, the memo concludes,
the casino ``will revitalize the area's tourism industry and
provide the impetus for additional tourist-related developments.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan still must be approved by BIA headquarters in
Washington. Then it must be approved by Gov. George Pataki, who to
this point has not disclosed his leanings. ``The governor
recognizes that gambling might be a valuable option for resort
areas like the Catskills,'' said Charles Deister, a spokesman for
Pataki. ``But we're going to have to wait and see what the federal
decision is.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Tarbell, the Mohawks' former legislative chairman, who
helped to draft the casino plan, said, ``I think it's a crucial
step because the central office very seldom overrules the area
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Washington office nor the eastern office, in
Arlington, Va., returned calls seeking comment on the agency's
endorsement, which was reported Tuesday in The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the construction of a 700,000-square-foot
casino and convention center at Monticello Raceway, under a
partnership between the Mohawks and three New York developers _
Watermark Investments, America Towers Partners and Alpha
Hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other tribes that offer gambling, the Mohawks are
planning to operate a casino far from their home territory, which
is several hundred miles to the north. The casino would be built on
a piece of land that would be placed in trust, and not subject to
taxes. The tribe would share its revenues with various local
governments.

KINGS' BODGER OUT; COYOTES' DRAKE SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kings defenseman Doug Bodger received a right
neck, chest cervical and shoulder strain and bruise, was left black
and blue from shoulder to elbow, can't lift his right arm above his
shoulder and probably will miss at least one game.
</P>
<P>
   And for inflicting this smorgasbord of damage with a nasty
boarding penalty during the Kings' 4-2 victory Monday night in
Phoenix, Coyotes winger Dallas Drake received a four-game
suspension from the NHL on Tuesday. At the time of the incident,
Drake received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct
from referee Mick McGeough.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension -- one game longer than what Kings defenseman Rob
Blake received for a slashing major earlier this month that left
Vancouver's Harry York with a bruised arm -- was issued following a
telephone hearing involving Drake and Colin Campbell, the NHL's
vice president of hockey operations. Campbell ruled that Drake had
intent to injure on the play.
</P>
<P>
   `The league views hits from behind as dangerous play,` Campbell
said, `and injuries resulted from Mr. Drake's illegal conduct.`
</P>
<P>
   Bodger is doubtful for the Kings' game tonight against the San
Jose Sharks at the Forum. The suspension will cost Drake $20,833.33
of his $1-million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Solid Storr (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   A key to Monday's victory was the play of goalie Jamie Storr,
who kept the Kings in the game early with numerous difficult saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie came up with a couple of huge stops at key times,''
Coach Larry Robinson said. ``It's what goaltending is about. It's
not stopping 50 shots, although when a goalie does that he can
steal a game. But when a goalie makes key stops at the right times,
that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also praised defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has been
the Kings' biggest disappointment this season, a player who
frequently has been an offensive non-factor and a defensive
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Duchesne probably played his best game since he's been
with the team,'' Robinson said. ``Things were working and he made a
much more concerted effort not to do anything too fancy, just play
good, safe hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne created several scoring chances with deft
stickhandling, avoided the turnovers that have plagued him, and
several times chose to remain in a safe defensive position rather
than go deep into the offensive zone to pursue a puck he had less
than a 50-percent chance of reaching. Bad decisions on such plays
have been one of his biggest problems all season.

BOTHA DISSECTING TYSON ON TAPE 
HOLMES GETS A TEXAS LICENSE 
HOLYFIELD-LEWIS A HOT TICKET 
JOHNSON TO RISK TITLE VS. TAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Nev., Texas, N.J. , Fla.)  
 (bl) 
By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a sacrificial lamb is not part of the strategy for
Francois Botha when he meets Mike Tyson on Jan. 16 in Las Vegas in
a heavyweight bout. Botha has been watching tapes of Tyson's two
losses to Evander Holyfield, and he plans on deploying the same
strategy that Holyfield did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys, like Bruce Seldon, who went against him were
scared,'' Botha said during a telephone conference call from his
training camp in Las Vegas on Tuesday. ``They ran away from him and
closed up so he was able to pick his shots. That's when Tyson wins.
You have to hit him, counter him or tie him up. Smothering him is a
good move. You've got to get him back on his heels, moving back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson believes that Holyfield was deliberately head-butting him
in the second fight, and he believes it was part of Holyfield's
strategy. Cut and bleeding, Tyson snapped and bit both of
Holyfield's ears. He was disqualified in the bout and the Nevada
State Athletic Commission subsequently revoked his license. Tyson's
license was reinstated Oct. 19 and Botha is his first opponent in
18 months. Botha doesn't believe Tyson will snap in the ring
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows all eyes are on him,'' Botha said. ``If he does
something wrong he'll never fight again in his life. After I beat
him, he'll still be able to make money. But if he snaps again,
he'll never make money again.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha is looking for bigger and better things after his Tyson
bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight most heavyweights wait for,'' Botha said. ``It
can put you up there where you belong. If I knock out Tyson, I'll
be the biggest thing in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes Gets a Texas License
</P>
<P>
   Even though his Jan. 23 bout in Houston against George Foreman
is on the ropes, Larry Holmes is moving forward. Holmes obtained
his Texas boxing license on Monday and is awaiting the letters of
credit from the promoter Roger Leavitt that will assure the purses
for the fight. Those letters were supposed to be forwarded to
Foreman and Holmes last week, but they weren't. Leavitt did not
return a telephone message left at his New York office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman already has $1 million of the $9 million he is supposed
to earn for the fight and Holmes has $400,000 of the $4 million he
is to earn. Both deposits are nonrefundable to Leavitt in the event
the bout is scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no postponement, no cancellation, no change in
anything; the fight is going forward,'' said Jay Newman, a
spokesman for Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreman-Holmes bout is in a tough spot in terms of possible
pay-per-view sells. It falls between Tyson-Botha, which will be
broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime Entertainment Television on
Jan. 16, and Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey, which will be shown on
TVKO on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield-Lewis a Hot Ticket
</P>
<P>
   With no Knicks basketball on the schedule, the hottest ticket at
New York's Madison Square Garden is for the Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification bout March 13. With
more than two months to go before the fight, 15,000 of the 19,800
seats have been sold and the bulk of the promotion for the bout has
yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are priced from $1,500 for ringside to $100 for seats in
the upper level of the arena. Most of the remaining tickets are for
middle-level seats that cost $1,000, $750 and $500. The bout will
be broadcast on pay-per-view by TVKO.
</P>
<P>
   Two other shows will keep the Garden busy until the
Holyfield-Lewis show. A welterweight championship fight between
Felix Trinidad and Pernell Whitaker is close to being completed for
the main arena Feb. 20 and a heavyweight bout between Shannon
Briggs and Lou Savarese is being scheduled for the Theater on Feb.
27.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson to Risk Title vs. Taylor
</P>
<P>
   _ Reggie Johnson, the International Boxing Federation
light-heavyweight champion, will defend his title against Will
Taylor on the undercard of the Briggs-Savarese show Feb. 27. The
fight could pave the way for Johnson to meet Roy Jones Jr. in April
for a light-heavyweight unification bout. Jones is scheduled to
fight Richard Frazier, a New York City police officer, in
Pensacola, Fla., on Jan. 9 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy Thunder has been selected as the opponent for Andrew
Golata on the Jan. 30 heavyweight doubleheader in Atlantic City,
N.J.. Michael Grant will fight Ahmad Abdin in the other bout. &QL;

LAWS OF GRAVITY NO MATCH FOR LAWS OF PARKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did Einstein know such humiliation? Would Galileo sit
still for this? Probably not, but Sam Dordoni, inventor of the
gravity-powered people-moving vehicle _ something like a perpetual
motion machine _ is stuck.
</P>
<P>
   His problem? His machine, which at first blush appears to
overcome the laws of physics, has been unable to overcome the laws
of New York City parking, and it is going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dignity won't stand for this,'' said Dordoni, a 51-year-old
mechanic, truck driver and bearded visionary from Watkins Glen,
N.Y., who has spent 20 years developing his device, the Gravtran.
Pelted by a cold rain, he mused about his predicament on Tuesday
across the street from the memorial arch in Washington Square Park,
where he has been day and night, protecting his contribution to
21st century technology, since Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a small tram or shuttle bus system best suited to
airports, stadiums, shopping malls or other congested hubs of human
activity, the Gravtran uses simple gravity _ no fuel whatsoever _
to propel people down slightly declining tracks or monorails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as though I'm pushing some kind of newfangled mouse
trap here,'' Dordoni said. ``This is something that can benefit
millions of people around the world, but I've got to get moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The stationary fate of his Gravtran prototype is, perhaps, a
cautionary tale of a grand idea gone awry, or of how pesky little
annoyances like no-parking signs and a Police Department tow truck
can alter the course of human progress.
</P>
<P>
   Dordoni, whose gravelly voice, cowboy hat and slightly bloodshot
eyes offer only brief distractions from his imposing command of
mechanical engineering, is by no means short on public support for
his invention.
</P>
<P>
   Without a patent, corporate support or government grants, he has
been pursuing publicity and financial backing aggressively,
particularly in New York City, for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a seemingly triumphant tour of Manhattan in December 1997, he
towed the Gravtran behind a gleaming new Chevy pickup from Times
Square, where he attracted film crews from MTV, to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, attracting crowds of curious onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dordoni's dream turned sour when he and his people-mover,
again powered by his pickup, returned to Manhattan a month ago. As
luck would have it, he had been issued three $115 parking tickets
during the 1997 tour. With interest and penalties, that left him
with a bill to the city of $364.29 by the time his truck was towed
on Dec. 7, leaving the Gravtran itself parked on Washington Square
North near Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the late December nights turn frigid inside his unheated
Gravtran, he has been forced to accept contributions of food,
blankets and warm clothing from students and faculty members at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it has been a blessing to be here because of the
unbelievable wealth of people who pass by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parked by a curb that is often thronged by students and
professors, he said he had fielded hundreds of questions about his
invention, and had often been overwhelmed by people peering inside
the vehicle. Although he has not been robbed or accosted _ even
when he has left the Gravtran to use a public telephone and
bathroom in Washington Square Park _ he said he has had to face the
occasional annoyance of students looking in late at night.
</P>
<P>
   All that, it might seem, is serving one of Dordoni's objectives
_ public attention. But he scoffs at any suggestion that his ordeal
of 22 days and nights has been staged as a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I want publicity, but not fame, and this is all just
getting in the way,'' he said. More to the point, he insisted, are
the opportunities he is missing to show his invention off elsewhere
in Manhattan, Connecticut and other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   For now, sleeping in conditions that he compared to the inside
of a refrigerator, he said his sole intention was to move on.
Although he has no money to pay for assistance, he said he could
offer the potentially lucrative, or worthless, alternative of stock
in a company that he hopes to form to market his dream of

BOWL IS A FIESTA FOR HOTELIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the greenbacks they will spend, Arizonans should welcome
Tennessee fans singing ``Rocky Top'' and the Florida State faithful
whooping it up with their war chant.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, those collegiate battle cries can fray the
nerves, but local hoteliers and other tourist-related businesses
like the sound of ringing cash registers associated with Fiesta
Bowl visitors _ to the tune of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Fiesta Bowl officials estimate the championship
college football game Monday and all the associated festivities
will pump into Arizona's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, a championship game between
Nebraska and Florida, contributed $96.8 million to the local
economy, according to an economic impact study that the Arizona
State University College of Business completed for the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical economics professor thinks that figure is inflated,
but hotel managers say there's no disputing the fact that the game
brings a surge in visitors at a time when most leisure and business
travelers are home for the holidays and when many hotels are
virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-related economic-impact studies are at best an estimate,
and the accuracy varies widely, said Mark Eschenfelder, an
associate professor of economics at Robert Morris College in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to think of the Fiesta Bowl is how different will
the community be because the event was held there,'' said
Eschenfelder, who teaches a course on the economics of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, based on the size of your economy, it's not that much
of a boost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The game will bring in a lot of visitors and a positive economic
impact from spending on lodging and souvenir T-shirts, but many of
the items are manufactured elsewhere, so the ``money leaks out of
the area pretty quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eschenfelder also rains on the Fiesta Bowl's parade of
volunteers and corporate sponsors who make the game and dozens of
other related events possible.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Fiesta Bowl, he asked, what other charities and
causes would benefit from those corporate donations and volunteer
efforts?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Fiesta Bowl gives Arizona a lot of
national exposure, Eschenfelder said.
</P>
<P>
   And that does influence people's decisions to visit Arizona,
said Brian Kinghorn, director of sales at The Buttes in Tempe,
which is hosting Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   More directly, the Fiesta Bowl fills hotel rooms. Not only for
The Buttes and the Scottsdale Plaza Resort, which is hosting
Tennessee, but for other Valley hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 game attracted 50,000 visitors who stayed an average of
four nights, according to the ASU economic-impact study.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in Tempe and Scottsdale, closer to Sun Devil Stadium,
benefit the most from the influx of football fans, said Tom
Silverman, owner of Embassy Suites Scottsdale, which will fill all
of its 311 rooms Sunday and Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the hotels are full, it goes right down the line to help
restaurants, rental-car agencies and retail shops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many hotels, the Fiesta Bowl surge helps at a slow time of
year, according to Joe Forster, vice president of sales and
marketing at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort. Hotel occupancy drops off
from the middle of December through the first or second week of
January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no demand for rooms, so visitors can get a nice room in
a Scottsdale resort for as little as $90, but during the Fiesta
Bowl that same room goes for $240 a night, Forster said.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale Plaza Resort has the advantage of hosting
Tennessee. The football team is occupying 150 rooms. Without the
team, the resort would have sold only 34 rooms on Monday night,
said Forster, a Fiesta Bowl committee member.
</P>
<P>
   From an economic standpoint, this year's Fiesta Bowl probably
will be the best ever, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a championship year, anybody could make this successful,''
Forster said. ``The trick with the bowl is to find a way to impact
the economy and have people here in a non-championship year.'' &QL;

FORMER QVC HOSTS TO SUE, CHARGING DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Minn., Pa.)  (rl) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two former hosts of the nation's largest home
shopping network are expected to file a $100 million class action
lawsuit Wednesday in Manhattan federal court accusing the
television network of discriminating against its black and Hispanic
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Velez and Gwen Owens, two former hosts of the QVC
network, say that the network relegates its black and Hispanic
hosts to late-night programs that have fewer viewers, and therefore
lower sales. The lawsuit says that in its 12-year history, QVC has
never featured a black or Hispanic salesman or woman as the
permanent host of one of its lucrative daytime or prime-time
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just a glass ceiling,'' Velez said. ``It's
concrete. You can't penetrate it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Rubin, a spokeswoman for QVC, said Tuesday that she would
not comment on the specific allegations. But she called the suit's
central charge an ``erroneous statement,'' saying that black and
Hispanic hosts do appear on QVC during the day and prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our hosts, who is an African-American, just hosted a
two-hour, prime-time special on Harley Davidsons which was a huge,
huge hit,'' Ms. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit offers a rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse of the home
shopping networks. QVC, based in West Chester, Pa., near
Philadelphia, is the nation's largest network, followed by the Home
Shopping Network in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Minneapolis-based
Valuevision. QVC made more than $2 billion in sales in 1997,
according to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubin said hosts are paid a fixed salary no matter how much
they sell. But Velez, a 34-year-old from Astoria, Queens, who is
now pursuing an acting career, said Tuesday that hosts are under
pressure to sell. A host's salary is not formally based on sales
commissions, Velez said, but he contended that sales volumes
affected raises, bonuses and contract renewals.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said that as a late-night host, he earned $80,000 a year.
Some hosts working the prime-time periods earned more than
$500,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and other black or Hispanic hosts were
occasionally offered prime-time specials _ such as the one Ms.
Rubin cited _ as ``bones'' to keep them happy. But white hosts
repeatedly leapfrogged over them onto the busier daytime and
prime-time programs during his two-year stint at QVC, Velez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their idea of being politically correct is to do a Kwanzaa
show at 2:30 in the morning when no one is watching,'' Velez said.
``I repeatedly suggested that we do something for Hispanic Heritage
month, but nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rich, Ms. Owens' lawyer, said his client did not wish to be
interviewed. He said that Ms. Owens, a native of Philadelphia and a
former television news anchor, worked as a host for QVC for just
under four years.
</P>
<P>
   Velez's contract with QVC was not renewed in December 1997 and
Ms. Owens' contract was not renewed this November.

ALLEGED RAPIST USED INTERNET TO LURE TEEN, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM WALSH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is a 13-year-old who chatted up a storm on the Internet, and
had connected with what she thought to be a genuinely nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed and impressionable, the Gilbert teen took up his offer
to meet in person _ she even lied to her grandparents to cover up
their rendezvous, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be a monstrous chat-room mistake. Police say
the man drove the girl 1,400 miles to Memphis, Tenn., where at a
trailer park, over a three-day period, he raped her, snapped
pornographic pictures of her and held her captive.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and scared, the girl managed a call to her grandfather on
Christmas Day. Four days had lapsed since she fibbed to her
guardians that she was going shopping with a friend, authorities
say.
</P>
<P>
   She told her grandfather that ``she was scared and afraid,''
said Sgt. Ken Fixel, a Gilbert police spokesman. ``He told her to
call 911. It was fantastic advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Her call to Memphis police led to the arrest of Patrick Neal
Champion, 35, of Memphis, and his girlfriend, Debra Kay Williams,
46. The pair were accused of rape in a case that Tennessee
authorities say could mushroom into a nationwide child pornography
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Champion also is accused of taking pornographic pictures of the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was reunited with her grandparents in Memphis on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of relieved she's coming back home,'' said Sgt. Larry
Wilson of the Memphis sex crimes unit. ``She was thousands of miles
away from home, around a bunch of people she didn't know.
Obviously, she had to be terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   When Memphis police arrested Champion, they seized a dozen
cameras, a computer and notebooks listing names and what appeared
to be the sexual preference of victims, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Memphis police are examining pictures and trying to
identify additional victims, but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also will join the investigation to determine whether
federal laws were violated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Joe Bonner, an FBI spokesman in Memphis, said the
agency is willing to help Memphis police in any way possible, but
added that state laws on pornography usually have more teeth than
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Larry Jacobs of the Phoenix police vice unit said the girl's
victimization is far from unusual as pedophiles flock to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Phoenix police arrested a Seattle man who thought
he was setting up a rendezvous with a 12-year-old boy who was
actually a detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the Internet is the new location that pedophiles
have used because of the anonymity it offers them,'' Jacobs said.
``It used to be that pedophiles had to go where the children were
to groom them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he is aware of cases where pedophiles have even
mailed airplane tickets to children, hoping they would come visit
and have sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are naive. That's what it comes down to. And kids need
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs warned parents to never allow children to use Internet
chat rooms without parental supervision. He said children should
not reveal personal information about themselves on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I tell any parent is to take a computer out of
a child's room and put it in the living room so they can monitor
it,'' Jacobs said. &QL;

JUDGE ORDERS HONOR SOCIETY TO ADMIT TWO PREGNANT STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ky.) 
(Eds: Chasity cq in 6th graf) 
(sw) 
By WILLIAM HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal court on Tuesday ordered the National Honor Society to
admit two Kentucky students who were denied membership last spring
because they had become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The young women must now be admitted to the society for the rest
of their senior year while they wait for their case to come to
trial. In issuing a preliminary injunction, Judge William O.
Bertelsman of federal District Court in Covington, Ky., asserted
that the women had ``a high probability'' of winning their case.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsman accepted the plaintiffs' argument that membership
would not do ``much good if they get admitted after they graduate
from high school in May.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Honor Society had argued that ``the public interest
requires support of the public school's efforts to encourage high
morals and strong character as part of the educational process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelsman ruled that a higher public interest is always
``to uphold the legal rights of others.'' Therefore, he wrote,
``the balance of equities favors the plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The two woman, Somer Chipman, 17, and Chasity Glass, 18, of
Grant County High School in Williamstown, Ky., were represented by
Sara L. Mandelbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's
Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision sets a very important precedent,'' Ms.
Mandelbaum said on Tuesday, ``because it gives teeth to the
under-enforced federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination,
pregnancy discrimination and marital status.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Cassidy, the lawyer for the Grant County School
District, the superintendent of schools and the faculty committee
that selected the society members, said her clients would comply
with the order even though they still believed the district ``did
not practice discrimination against the two students when it made
the decision not to grant them admission to the honor society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass said she was ``in a state of shock'' after receiving
word of Bertelsman's decision. ``I'm really, really excited about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of their junior year, Ms. Chipman's grade-point
average was 3.9 on a scale of 4.0, and Ms. Glass' was 3.7. They
said they were never officially told why that out of 33 students
with the required academic standing, they alone were denied entry
to the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   When they asked for an explanation, they say they were told that
they had not measured up to the criteria for admission.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass is single, and she and her daughter, Shelby, who is 20
months old, live with her parents. Her daughter's father, she said,
is in the National Guard and sends her $40 a week for child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman's daughter, Cheyenne, was born in June. Ms. Chipman
and her child's father, Shawn Hurston, were married in August.

LASSITER PICKS OFF WEEKLY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals safety  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter is expected to be named NFC
Defensive Player of the Week today for his four interceptions in
Sunday's victory over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the third Cardinals defender to win that honor this
season, joining defensive end &UR; Simeon Rice and strong safety  &UR; Tommy
 &UR; Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter's four interceptions tied an NFL record and helped the
Cardinals advance to Saturday's NFC wild-card game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was, if he paid off the quarterback or
the (San Diego) coach, but he just had an incredible feel for the
ball,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter received another honor Tuesday when he was named the
Miller Lite NFL Player of the Week. He is only the second defensive
player to get that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals quarterback &UR; Jake Plummer won the award last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter had eight interceptions, an NFC high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how things work out,'' Lassiter said. ``I only
start five games and have eight interceptions. It's the most I've
had at any level.'' &QL; 
Call waiting &QL; 
Cardinals defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis learned Tuesday that
he and Buffalo offensive coordinator  &UR; Joe Pendry are on the Chicago
Bears' short list to replace  &UR; Dave Wannstedt as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting,'' said McGinnis, a longtime assistant
with the Bears. ``Again, I've never pursued any of that stuff.
Obviously, us winning is the catalyst to anything anybody wants to
do. That's all I'm concerned about, us winning and doing the job I
have here. I've got a good job and good situation here, and
obviously, all we have to do is keep winning and all that other
stuff will take care of itself.'' &QL; 
Calling all fans &QL; 
The Cardinals will have a fans playoff celebration from 1 to 5 p.m.
Thursday at the new Warner-Hardy Sports Complex, just north of the
training facility. There will be food vendors, interactive games,
autographs and free merchandise from the team shop. Admission is
free.
</P>
<P>
   And for those fans wanting to attend Saturday's game in Dallas,
the Cardinals are offering a chartered travel package for $749. The
cost includes round-trip airfare on America West Airlines, ground
travel to the Holiday Inn Select in North Dallas as well as to
Texas Stadium on game day, a game ticket and a Cardinals T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will depart Phoenix on Friday and return after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested should call Baker's Travel at 998-8922. The
trip is subject to cancellation if a minimum requirement is not
met. &QL; 
Still hurting &QL; 
Receiver  &UR; Frank Sanders, who suffered a bruised left knee against
the Chargers, missed practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said no structural damage was found in
Sanders' knee and he should be able to play against the Cowboys. &QL; 
In God's hands &QL; 
A day after he was declared out for Saturday's game, Cowboys
All-Pro cornerback  &UR; Deion Sanders was upgraded to doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``With God, all things are possible,'' said Sanders, who has
played only 25 snaps since suffering a sprained big toe on his left
foot against the Cardinals on Nov. 15.
</P>

ADVERTISING: ETHNIC HOLIDAYS AS WAY TO REACH NICHES

   During a season when consumers are bombarded with marketing that
is wrapped in messages of holiday greetings and good will, some
companies are expanding their campaigns to include cultural
holidays and festivals like Kwanzaa and the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell everything from banking services to apparel
view such marketing as a way to build credibility and broaden their
appeal to ethnic consumers, who have a rapidly accelerating amount
of purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to the essence of good marketing, which is tying into
something that is important to the consumer,'' said Lisa Skriloff,
president of Multicultural Marketing Resources Inc. in New York.
``Certainly there are opportunities where marketers reach out to
the general market, whether its Presidents' Day sales or a seasonal
holiday shopping opportunity,'' she added. ``It is the smart
marketers who are looking for opportunities that are not
overexploited and where they can cut through the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations looking to reach new markets not just by expanding
across the globe but also by reaching more underserved markets in
their backyards are creating ads and commercials tied to occasions
like Kwanzaa, the African-American holiday that runs from Dec. 26
to Jan. 1, Three Kings Day on Jan. 6. and the Lunar New Year in
February.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is running Kwanzaa ads created by Caroline Jones Inc.
in New York that do not show a single Big Mac. The message is not
so much about french fries and burgers as it is to show the company
as understanding and respecting African-Americans' sense of family
and community. One commercial, for instance, shows families in
festive settings, including a choir performing to a jubilant
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will continue to use Christmas
advertizements in Hispanic communities until Three Kings Day, when
many Hispanic families worship and exchange gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a marketer that has obviously made a commitment to
your community, that will be the one that wins out,'' said Alex
Lopez Negrete, whose agency, Lopez Negrete Communications in
Houston, specializes in marketing to the Hispanic community. The
agency assists Wal-Mart, Nationsbank and Goya Foods with marketing
aimed at this consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that while speaking to an ethnic market during
cultural festivals or holidays can provide access to new consumers,
companies should take caution not to offend or patronize potential
new customers by not doing their homework or by reaching out to
them only during festive times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise our clients to be committed throughout the
year,'' said Michelle Flowers, president of Flowers Communications
Group in Chicago, a public relations firm that specializes in
marketing to the African-American market. ``But during times of the
year of major significance to the market, you can make sure you are
visibly showcasing your commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers Communications has advised companies like Mary Kay Inc.
and the Lawry's Foods Inc. unit of Unilever PLC on ethnic-specific
promotions. Lawry's, for one, promotes Martin Luther King Day and
Black History Month. The maker of Lawry's Seasoned Salt also
supports the Billiken Day Parade, a large parade held each August
in Chicago and sponsored by African-American newspaper, The Chicago
Defender, to pay tribute to a mythical figure that protects
children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawry's conducts a ``Jeopardy''-like quiz show in Chicago public
schools during Black History Month, and the winners ride on the
company's Billiken Day Parade float. The company is also coming out
next month with a cartoon video called ``Our Friend Martin'' in
celebration of Martin Luther King and the holiday commemorating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, companies are not simply being altruistic. The
ultimate goal is to persuade more consumers to view the companies
in a favorable light and therefore to buy more of their goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it measurable in sales?'' said Wanla Cheng of Asia Link
Consulting Group in New York, a research and consulting firm that
specializes in the Asian market. ``Nobody can say, but it goes a
long way toward building good will. I think it's the cost of doing
business in a way if you want to court these audiences. And it
really is a good time to reach them because holidays are a very
festive time and to be part of that creates a very positive
atmosphere that I think adds to the impact of the message.''
</P>
<P>
   For Asian consumers, for instance, the Lunar New Year in
February provides an opportunity to target these potential new
customers. Companies tend to run celebratory ads in Asian
newspapers for the occasion as well as to participate in parades
tied to the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheng maintains that while numbers for sales generated by
promoting such events may be hard to come by ``everything we have
done says these immigrant consumers are very appreciative of
American companies that recognize them as a valuable customer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they are being respected in their own way and for
who they are as an immigrant,'' she added, ``and they listen.'' &QL;

`2 1/2 JEWS': WINNING OR LOSING IN LAW AND LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nathan Minter is one of those overbearing men who
believe that success in their chosen professions makes them,
without further effort, successful sons, husbands and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   As Alan Brandt sets out to demonstrate in ``2{ Jews,'' his
understanding and compassionate debut play, which bares a man's
flaws but shies from tragedy, Nathan Minter is a winner as a
humanitarian lawyer but a loser in his personal relationships. Oh,
his 78-year-old immigrant father, Morris, may refer to him as the
``Jewish Clarence Darrow,'' and his Yale-educated son, Marc, may
call him the ``Albert Schweitzer of the legal profession,'' but the
descriptions are drenched in bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, played by Richard M. Davidson, may boast of his
victories against the odds and his commitment to hopeless and
indigent clients, but he is blind to his self-absorption, his anger
and the damage he inflicts on those closest to him. His gentile
wife of 34 years can no longer accept his repeated absences, for
professional reasons, from important family occasions like their
son's graduation and Thanksgiving dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes being married to a winner'' is Nathan's arrogant
explanation for why he is certain she will understand his latest
failure to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's son (Tyagi Schwartz) may have followed in his father's
footsteps to become a lawyer and a newly minted partner in a
white-shoe law firm. But he is the object not of his father's
unalloyed pride but of suggestions that he should have spurned
upscale lawyering in favor of partnership with Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   And while the obstreperous Morris (Sam Gray), a free-thinking
immigrant who arrived at 16 from Lithuania and settled in the
Bronx, can see Nathan clearly from the vantage point of his years
and experience, Nathan doesn't want to listen to him, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan will have to pay a price before he can begin to achieve
self-understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, the author of ``2{ Jews,'' which is playing until Feb. 7
at the Raymond J. Greenwald Theater in Chelsea, comes to play
writing at 75 after a career as a lyricist of songs like ``That's
All,'' a publicist and, more recently, a dealer in primitive art.
So, like Morris, he brings the experience of a lifetime to his
intergenerational drama.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt spends too much time at the outset trying to milk humor
from a brush with the law that brings Nathan to Morris' defense,
and his warm heart makes him opt for a convenient ending after his
exploration of family relationships raises other interesting
subjects like residual bigotry in the midst of philosophical
altruism. But ``2{ Jews,'' sprinkled with lighthearted moments,
remains an easy-to-watch cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Joe Brancato, the conflicts are clear,
and the cast is well chosen, with Gray as the feisty Morris a
particular delight.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Because everyone else even remotely involved in the 183-day NBA
lockout seems to be holding conference calls these days, the agents
decided to have their voices heard Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agents Steve Kauffman, Keith Glass and Jerome Stanley, all of
whom represent mostly middle- and lower-class players, claimed NBA
commissioner David Stern is attempting to use strong-arm tactics to
get a new collective-bargaining agreement that will greatly benefit
owners, even if it means canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' response to such a threat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have the season, they have the season; if they don't,
they don't,'' said Glass, who called the owners' negotiating
tactics ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman, Glass and Stanley said the negotiations had been
scripted in an effort to drive a wedge between the union members
and their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been the case,'' Stanley said. ``I think this
has been a well-orchestrated, pre-planned negotiation. It's
probably been in the works for 24 months, ever since they began to
see what the effects were of the '95 deal (when player salaries
began to skyrocket).
</P>
<P>
   ``And they realized that during the '95 deal they should have
done things differently; they decided that what they were going to
do is push the issue to this point. I believe it is a scripted
negotiation on the part of management.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik say if there is no
progress in negotiations, they will recommend canceling the season
when the league convenes a meeting of its Board of Governors on
Jan. 7. Union executive director Billy Hunter and a large number of
players and agents insist they are bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   All three agents took issue with the league's insistence the
season should not fall by the wayside without a vote by the union
membership on the owners' latest proposal. Hunter, who rejected the
NBA's proposal at a Sunday meeting with Stern, has stated many
times he will not present an offer he thinks is unacceptable for a
vote of the union membership.
</P>
<P>
   The agents agreed with Hunter's stance and cautioned against a
secret ballot by the union, even though several players have said
lately they will ask for just that before allowing the season to
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is another calculated, manipulative gesture by
management,'' said Stanley of the call for a vote. ``They know that
to open it up to a vote at this time and allow them a chance to
turn their P.R. machine on would create some dissension. They know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley contested the league's stance by demanding the owners
vote on the union's proposal, apparently forgetting the league
plans to do just that at the Board of Governors meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be doing that on Jan. 7, and it is the unanimous
recommendation of our committee that it be rejected and no further
proposals be made,'' Granik said. ``So we're doing it on Jan. 7.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents stressed the concessions the union has made _
limiting high-end salaries, agreeing to a four-year rookie scale
and reducing annual raises _ while blasting the inflexibility of
the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary,'' said Kauffman, who characterized Stern
as arrogant and condescending. ``I can't overstate the concession
that's made when you sacrifice the top-end guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think David Stern a few years ago in his wildest
dreams thought he could get this. It's a monumental concession.
That can't be understated.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Figure out) how much money the Los Angeles Lakers will save
by not having to pay Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant what they
would have had to pay under the old deal,'' he said. ``That's the
offer we're making. At what point does it become enough? At what
point do owners stand up to their negotiator and say, `Hey, we've
already gotten enough. Let's move forward.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stern points to the concessions the owners made in their last
proposal _ increasing the percentage of revenues that will be
devoted to salaries, increasing minimum salaries, adding an
exception to the salary cap to help beef up the league's middle
class and accepting the union's 10-percent limitation on the escrow
fund, which is designed to act as a hedge against salary
overspending _ as proof they are interested in negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern said the owners do not want to give in on such items
as ending opt-out clauses and voiding a player's Larry
Bird-exception status should he be traded in the last year of his
contract, because they drive salaries beyond the percentage of
revenue they would like to devote to salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, if the percentage is too high, it's not
a good deal for the owners,'' Stern said. ``The concessions we have
made still retain some risk, but that's all the risk the owners are
prepared to take on.''
</P>
<P>
   So the battle lines have been drawn.
</P>
<P>
   No more negotiating sessions are scheduled, even though the
agents indicated the union likely will draw up one final
counterproposal to submit to the owners in a last-ditch effort to
save the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern and Granik insist the owners will not give up any more
concessions and say Sunday's proposal was basically a
take-it-or-leave-it deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stern expects the players to accept the deal under duress,
just because he's threatened to cancel the season, that won't
happen,'' Stanley said. ``To hold hostage the game for anything
more than what's available right now borders on greed.''

OFFICERS' KILLING OF WOMAN IN CAR LEADS TO DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) 
(Eds: SUBS 21st graf bgng, On Tuesday, family ..., to clarify that
it's Miss Miller's home.) (lb) 
By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ A 19-year-old black woman was killed here in
a hail of police bullets as she sat in her disabled car early
Monday, a gun in her lap, leading relatives to accuse the officers
of murder and local civil rights officials to ask for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want us to march and protest against the
police,'' said Don Bardo, president of the Urban League of
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. ``But I'm telling people to
be cool until the investigation is completed. Let's not make the
tragedy any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That the death of the woman, Tyisha Miller, is a tragedy is
about the only thing everyone can agree on about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 2 a.m. on Monday, the authorities received a 911
call saying that a woman in a car at a gas station in Riverside was
asleep or unconscious with a pistol in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:01 a.m. four Riverside police officers, three white and one
Hispanic, arrived and tried to wake the woman as she sat in her
locked Nissan Sentra with the windows rolled up. A few moments
later, Ms. Miller was dead. Her family said her body and car were
riddled with as many as two dozen bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the shooting, police said that Ms. Miller had
shot at them once and, fearing for their lives, the officers
returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, a police spokesman, Sgt. Chris Manning, said
it was unclear whether Ms. Miller had fired. But, Manning said, Ms.
Miller did grab the gun after the officers smashed the driver's
side window to get to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continued interviews,'' Manning said, ``we weren't as
absolute that a round was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller's cousin, Anthonete Joiner, 18, who had placed the
call to 911, was 30 or 40 feet away from the car during the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner had gone to the gas station before the police
arrived, to help her cousin with a flat tire. But when she and a
friend arrived at the station, they found Ms. Miller either asleep
or unconscious, her seat reclined.
</P>
<P>
   The car's radio was blasting and the heat was turned to high.
</P>
<P>
   The police were unable to wake her, even after knocking on the
windows. They also saw the gun on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Butler, the cousins' uncle, said that Ms. Joiner had called
911, thinking that an ambulance would be sent to the scene, and had
no idea that the police would arrive instead. But because of the
report of the gun, the police came, Manning said, ``so that they
could remove the threat of a handgun, so the medical personnel
could respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Press-Enterprise reported Tuesday that Ms. Joiner
said her cousin ``was lying in her car shaking,'' her eyes rolling
and mouth foaming. Ms. Joiner could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that Ms. Joiner told him that when the police
arrived at the gas station, they ordered her to step back and
immediately began pounding on the window and screaming at Ms.
Miller to open the door. The next thing Ms. Joiner saw, said her
uncle, was the officers shooting her cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't a criminal,'' Butler said of Ms. Miller. ``She was
a young girl with a flat tire and she fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthonete is devastated,'' Butler said. ``She is so upset. She
feels guilty because she thinks it's her fault her cousin got
murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, whom the police would not identify, have been
placed on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of what
will surely be a carefully watched investigation. Two of the
officers had less than five years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside County district attorney's office is investigating
the shooting, which Michael Soccio, a spokesman, said could take
weeks. ``We will be attempting to determine if any criminal conduct
occurred,'' Soccio said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the yard and the street in front of the Millers' home here
filled up, the city of Riverside and civic officials such as Bardo
were working to calm tensions. On Monday night, Bardo, a
representative from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and several other neighborhood advocates were
briefed by Chief Jerry Carroll of the Riverside police on the
shooting. ``There wasn't a lot of information,'' Bardo said. ``But
there was a whole lot of gray.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, family and friends gathered in the front yard of
Miss Miller's home, a yellow ranch-style house in nearby Rubidous
and quietly talked about organizing a neighborhood car wash on New
Year's Day to raise money for Ms. Miller's burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might as well have lynched her,'' said the Rev. Bernell
Butler, a friend of the family. ``This might as well be
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bardo said, ``Nobody knows what to believe,'' adding, ``I'm
not taking any side until I find out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a difficult year for race relations in Riverside,
a city of about 250,000 people 60 miles east of Los Angeles. In
January there was a bitter and embarrassing debate about whether to
name the new high school after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
In the end, it did receive that name.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, a black man shot and wounded the mayor, two
city council members and three police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a former city employee, had objected to what he said
was unfair treatment of young black and Hispanic residents.

HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN OF POWERFUL FLU STRAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the first confirmed case of influenza in Los
Angeles County, public health officials warned Tuesday that the
Type A virus identified might not be covered fully by vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The county, state Department of Health Services and the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will examine a sample
taken Christmas Eve from the first confirmed case of the flu in Los
Angeles County, a 17-year-old boy from West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe that the boy became sick with the A/Sydney
strain, which is covered by the vaccine. But they cautioned that
the virus may have mutated even slightly, which means people sick
previously with Type A could fall sick again, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it can keep changing, you can be infected by a flu
which your body has never seen before,'' said Dr. Loring Dales of
the state Department of Health Services' communicable disease
division. ``You can have full-blown influenza, and you just feel
like you've been hit by a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that some doctors are predicting a
fairly mild influenza season because it has started later than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the brunt of the flu season to be coming in the next
two to four weeks. I don't think it's going to be a particularly
heavy season,'' said Dr. Pamela H. Nagami, staff physician for
internal medicine and infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center in suburban Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Nagami also believes that the vaccine in use will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good match this year. Last year was one of
those rare years where the vaccine was missing a key strain,''
Nagami said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the vaccine did not include the A/Sydney strain of
the virus, but this year it includes that strain and both the
A/Beijing and B/Harbin strains.
</P>
<P>
   County health officials believe Los Angeles' first case is
A/Sydney because that strain is turning up in most of the
California cases, as compared with the B/Harbin strain in the
Northeast, said Dr. David Dassey, deputy director of acute
communicable disease control for the county Department of Health
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the type of influenza virus is important particularly
because Type A strains tend to produce more severe illness, Dassey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sicker longer and are more likely to develop the
complication of pneumonia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend that the elderly and young adults and children
with chronic illnesses get flu shots, because influenza can be
deadly for them or they can develop serious complications.
</P>
<P>
   And there still is time to get a flu shot. ``Although it's
getting late, it's still not too late,'' Dales said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials advise people with symptoms including fever,
cough, headache, muscle ache and fatigue to stay home during the
first three to five days of illness. The recommended treatment is
to eat lightly and drink plenty of fluids.
</P>
<P>
   People should contact their doctor if they encounter severe
symptoms or have chronic illness or heart disease. Influenza can be
deadly, killing 10,000 to 30,000 people annually, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The antiviral drugs amantadine or rimantadine are available with
a prescription for adults, and can shorten the duration of the
disease and lessen its ability to be transmitted, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin substitutes are advised for children to control fever.
</P>
<P>
   With school out, health officials don't have one reliable
measure of the depth of flu _ absentees from school.
</P>
<P>
   The seven confirmed cases in the state so far likely are only
the ``tip of the iceberg'' because many doctors do not participate
in the national influenza reporting system overseen by the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dales said. But he said
those few cases are a good indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we haven't seen is any evidence of outbreak activity. No
health department is telling us they are getting calls from doctors
or medical facilities saying cases are just pouring in,'' he said.
``But of course, if it is going to happen, it would happen about
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dales noted that the lack of flu outbreaks among the elderly is
a sign of the vaccine's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places like nursing homes and senior citizen residences
where usually everyone gets a flu shot, we're getting no reports of
clusters of cases. I think it's having an effect. It keeps flu from
reaching the high-risk people,'' he said.

By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first official data from the federal government
show that most states are meeting the work requirements of the 1996
welfare law, with 28 percent of adults on the rolls participating
in some type of work activity, administration officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether states will be able to meet the more
stringent requirements that take effect in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare reform law was designed to promote work, and
that's exactly what's happening,'' President Clinton's chief
domestic policy adviser, Bruce N. Reed, said. ``More people on
welfare are working, and more people are leaving welfare to go to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The new data attest to the work effort of welfare recipients but
do not show whether people who leave welfare have found good jobs,
as Congress intended. Jodie Levin-Epstein, a welfare expert at the
Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group,
sounded a note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption that any job is a step up the ladder,
and that's true for some welfare recipients,'' she said. ``But many
people get stuck on the first rung of the ladder and remain in
poverty because the jobs do not lead to higher wages, even over
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   All 36 of the states reporting data for 1997 met the work
requirement, with work participation rates ranging from 13.5
percent in Louisiana to 96.7 percent in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law reversed six decades of social welfare policy,
eliminated the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the
nation's poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run
their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   Public attention has focused on one objective of the law,
reducing the number of welfare recipients, but a related objective
was to insure that people who still remain on the welfare rolls
would work.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the law stipulates that adults must be working in no
fewer than 25 percent of the families on welfare, or else states
are subject to financial penalties. This figure rises by 5
percentage points a year, to 50 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, states get credit for reducing the number of
people on welfare. The federal work requirements are reduced, or
liberalized, for states that have reduced their welfare rolls since
1995, as almost all states have. Nationwide, the number of people
on welfare has dropped by nearly one-third, to 8.4 million, since
August 1996, when the welfare bill was signed.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many welfare experts doubted that the states could
meet the law's work requirements. State officials say doing so
required fundamental changes in the expectations of welfare
recipients and the culture of welfare offices, shifting the focus
from the issuance of checks to employment and jobs. In 10 states,
fewer than 25 percent of the adult welfare recipients were working
in 1997, but the states still met the law's requirements, because
these states reduced their welfare rolls and were rewarded by
having their work requirement lowered.
</P>
<P>
   States in this category include California, with a work
participation rate of 20.6 percent, Georgia (20.6 percent),
Louisiana (13.5 percent), Maryland (18.3 percent), Mississippi
(17.2 percent) and Texas (19.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Iowa, Oregon, Wisconsin and Wyoming were among the
``high performers.'' In each of these states, more than half of the
adult welfare recipients were working or participating in work
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Data for 14 states were unavailable, incomplete or unverified.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie R. Marino, acting commissioner of the Connecticut
Department of Social Services, said the state, with a 58.4 percent
work participation rate, had a strong economy and had helped people
move from welfare to work by providing Medicaid, child care, rental
assistance and transportation services. Ms. Marino said the 1996
law provided ``a sense of empowerment, allowing people to realize
that they could do something productive with their lives, and that
we would do something to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the metropolitan region, New York state, with 27.9
percent of its adult welfare recipients working in 1997, was right
around the national average, while New Jersey, at 20.7 percent, was
below. New York has about one-tenth of the nation's welfare
families, and slightly more than two-thirds of the state's welfare
recipients live in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   James D. Neely, deputy director of Oregon's welfare program,
said the state had enforced stringent work requirements since the
early 1990s and had spent ``a substantial amount of state money,
over and above what we had to spend,'' to help people move from
welfare to work. ``Anybody who comes through the door has to work
or perform some activity to get ready for work as soon as
possible,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, welfare experts said, people who remain on the rolls
will be harder to place in jobs because they have fewer skills,
less education and less work experience, and are more likely to
have physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, states will have more money to spend on
training and preparing each person who remains on the rolls,
because the amount of the federal grant for each state is fixed
even though the welfare rolls are plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Very few welfare recipients are exempt from the work
requirements of the 1996 law. States may, if they choose, exempt
single parents caring for children under 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon M. Daly, vice president of Catholic Charities USA,
said: ``If you, as a single mother, have one or two children
between the ages of 1 and 5 and you have to work too, it's very
hard. Often you don't have time for school or training, so you're
locked into a low-paying job.''
</P>
<P>
   The new calculations were made by the federal Department of
Health and Human Services, from data submitted by the states. They
are consistent with new data from the Census Bureau that show a
substantial increase in the proportion of single women on welfare
who have earnings from employment. Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for
the department, said the census data also showed an increase in
average monthly earnings for welfare recipients with jobs, to $592
in the final months of 1997 from $500 at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While most states have been focusing on the numerical goals for
employment of welfare recipients in general, the 1996 law set
separate goals for two-parent families, and many states have failed
to meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 percent of two-parent families were working or
participating in work activities in 1997. The basic goal, set by
the 1996 law, was that 75 percent of such families should have been
working in 1997, but the specific goal for each state was adjusted
to give states credit for reducing their welfare rolls. A family
was in compliance if one parent, or both parents together, worked
35 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 states reporting data on two-parent families, 17
failed to meet their goals, even after the goals were reduced.
Two-parent families account for a small proportion of all welfare
families, just 7 percent of the national total.

BOULUD'S MISSING JEEP; NEW YEAR'S AT THE FOUR SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He Can't Even Get A Car Stolen Here
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How easy is it to misplace a car in Manhattan? Ask
chef Daniel Boulud.
</P>
<P>
   One day in late November, an employee at Boulud's soon-to-open
reincarnation of his famous restaurant, Daniel, parked Boulud's
blue Jeep Cherokee on East 80th Street near East End Avenue. The
employee could have sworn he parked it somewhere else. The result:
He thought it had been stolen, and Boulud reported that to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Jeep sat _ and sat and sat _ on East 80th. After a
few weeks, someone, evidently frustrated by the loss of a precious
parking space, scrawled on the windows, ``Hey NYPD: I Am a Stolen
Car'' in big letters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that helpful tip, traffic police officers, who festooned
the car with tickets, never checked to see whether it had been
reported stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic agents do not carry computers with them when they
write the summonses,'' said officer John Seidl, a police spokesman.
``So they can't run the plates to see whether parked cars are
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, would that be the thing to do?'' he added.
``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was finally solved on Monday, when Mark Sauter, the
executive vice president of APB Online, a news service devoted to
crime news, spotted the Jeep while walking along the street. Sauter
traced the license plate back to Boulud, and alerted him and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Farkas, an assistant to Boulud, said no one was really
blaming the employee who lost the Jeep. ``It happens to
everybody,'' she said. ``The thing that amazes us is that a car can
sit somewhere that long in the city and not get stolen,'' she
added. ``There's a holiday story in there somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   No Shower Singing
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barbara Cook, the cabaret legend and former Broadway
ingenue, has shared the stage with an impressive list of stars in
her career. But she does not plan to share it Thursday night with
Philip Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, with Philip Johnson's fountain.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a lavish, $800-a-person New Year's Eve feast, Ms.
Cook will perform at the Four Seasons, the first time the landmark
restaurant designed by Johnson has ever had a live performance.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem: The tranquil Pool Room, where she is to
sing, also has a fountain that spills into the pool and elegantly
muffles the conversations of the deal-making diners. It would
not-so-elegantly muffle Ms. Cook's soprano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they're dealing with it,'' she said Tuesday,
on a break from rehearsing. ``I think when I come out I'll just
throw a few coins into the pool and ask them to turn that fountain
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Niccolini, a managing partner of the restaurant, said he
would make sure she does not even have to ask. ``She was basically
going to be competing against Philip Johnson,'' he said. ``And
that's no good. The fountain will be silent while she is singing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if she wanted the pool turned into a huge bubble
bath, he could accommodate that as well. ``Anything for her, and
anything to make this evening a success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Niccolini explained that the restaurant had decided to feature
singing and a midnight meal for about 120 _ with beluga caviar,
black truffles, and Perrier-Jouet champagne, among other delicacies
_ for the first time this year basically because New Year's Eves
past had been, well, depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would come in and eat and leave for parties,'' he said.
``At midnight the only people left here were the staff. And they
would pop a few bottles of champagne. It's time to give some life
to the Four Seasons.''

DAYNE STAYS ON TRACK AT WISCONSIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Wisconsin junior running back Ron Dayne
continues to prepare for the biggest football game of his career,
he is content knowing that one of his life's biggest decisions has
already been made.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is this: Dayne, who has rushed for 4,845 yards in
three seasons (including bowl games), is staying in school for one
more year. He won't be turning pro and he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   While he had been expected to make no announcement until after
Friday's Rose Bowl, Dayne felt getting it out of the way early
would take some pressure off and allow him to get prepared for
UCLA. It will also give him some time to visit family back home in
Berlin, N.J., after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come back to Madison (Wis.) early and make
the decision,'' Dayne said Tuesday. ``I wanted to go home and stay
home for a little while because I haven't been home for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   While he will be spending time with his year-old daughter Jada,
and her mother, Dayne's girlfriend Alia, Dayne also has plans to
visit his uncle, a pastor, who raised Dayne after Dayne's parents
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers and the Bruins will face off in the Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day. Dayne, who carried the ball 268 times in 1998 and
gained 1,279 yards, is expected to play a huge role.
</P>
<P>
   While Miami running back Edgarrin James had a big game against a
lackluster Bruins defense on Dec. 5 and led his team to a 49-45
victory, the soft-spoken Dayne, known to his teammates as the
``Great Dayne,'' is neither overconfident nor cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one running back,'' he said. ``It ain't like every
running back did that (against UCLA), so you can't really use that.
I just want to go out and play hard and do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1998, Dayne has been plagued by injuries and
criticism of his straight-up running style. Yet if he gains 155
yards against the Bruins in the Rose Bowl, he will have 5,000 yards
career rushing.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt he will get the ball. The question is, how
many times?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he carries it 50, that's a pretty good barometer,'' said
Brad Childress, Wisconsin's offensive coordinator. ``We're going to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since head coach Barry Alvarez took over at Wisconsin nine
seasons ago, his teams have compiled a 32-2 record when rushing 50
or more times.
</P>
<P>
   But, what if Dayne only gets half that many carries?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what 25 they are,'' Childress said. ``You know
sometimes you can have a one-play drive or a five-play drive or a
10-play drive before you score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's no secret we're going to hand him the football,''
he continued. ``And (the Bruins) are going to stack the line of
scrimmage and try to prevent him from running the football.''
</P>
<P>
   But coach Alvarez cautions against believing the Badgers are
simply a one-man team, in spite of Dayne's considerable
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three All-Americans on this team,'' he said.
``That's two besides Dayne.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Alvarez doesn't think the Bruins' performance
against Miami's James is any indication of how they'll do against
Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't paid much attention to that game,'' he said.
``I thought that game was an aberration. I don't anticipate things
going that way on Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how things go, Dayne admits the Badgers need to
win the Rose Bowl as a tribute to departing seniors who joined the
team after it won the 1994 Rose Bowl against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' Dayne said. ``But it's important for the
guys under them, too. We've got to come back next year and play, so
we just want to go out and do our best, and hopefully come home
with a win.''

DISNEY IS MONEY-MAKING STUDIO SUPREME FOR 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Clarifies standings in last graf) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Mickey's got bragging rights for another year
as the king of Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an asteroid (``Armageddon''), a Chinese heroine
(``Mulan''), an unlikely football star (``The Waterboy'') and a
bunch of bugs (``A Bug's Life''), Walt Disney Co. will edge
Paramount by $18 million to become 1998's domestic box office
champ.
</P>
<P>
   The victory _ Disney's fourth in five years _ is sweet because
the entertainment giant did not move into first until last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real `Rocky' story for us,'' said distribution
chief Phil Barlow. ``We had a hell of a comeback. We had four very
weak months at the start of the year with $90 million going into
May, but once we released `The Horse Whisperer,' we came on very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is expect to finish with $1.103 billion in gross domestic
receipts. Paramount's final total will be $1.085 billion, with
better than 40 percent of that coming from ``Titanic's'' 1998
grosses. That makes 1998 the only time two studios have topped $1
billion. Disney passed the mark in 1994, 1995 and 1996; Sony set
the record last year with $1.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A strong late-year performance by Disney is no surprise. It
usually weighs its schedule toward holiday periods when
family-oriented fare _ ``Toy Story,'' ``101 Dalmatians'' and
``Flubber'' in recent years _ reach the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also credit Disney as a strong marketer. ``Disney is a
well-oiled machine with a lot of good product and huge
distribution,'' said Arthur Rockwell, a former studio executive.
``They're very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen 1998 films topping $100 million, four belonged to
Disney and two to Paramount (``The Truman Show,'' ``Deep Impact'').
``It's remarkable that two companies have done this much business
in a year,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its four hit films, Disney generated respectable
performance from ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Six Days, Seven
Nights,'' ``The Parent Trap'' and ``Enemy of the State.'' The only
true disappointment for Disney came in October with the
back-to-back releases of a pair of pricey projects, ``Holy Man''
and ``Beloved,'' that performed very poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Armageddon'' took in the highest gross, Disney's
most profitable movies were ``The Waterboy,'' which cost a mere $23
million to make, and ``A Bug's Life,'' with massive receipts from
foreign, video and toy licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which slumped slightly in 1997 with $880 million at the
box office, has maintained fairly consistent performances despite
limiting the number of releases each to year to around 18 in order
to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret is to have good moviemakers making entertaining
movies,'' Barlow said ``It would be even more enjoyable if
production and marketing costs weren't so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony will finish a distant third with about $750 million,
followed by 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.

MINUTEMEN FALL IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-UMASS-DAVIDSON-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Jim Greenidge 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ There was a nice flow to their game in the
first half, and that's why the University of Massachusetts
Minutemen were up, 42-27, on Davidson. But then the visitors made a
fierce comeback in the second half, taking the confidence out of
the Minutemen and making the basket look a whole lot smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson outscored UMass, 48-24 in the second half and 11-2 in
overtime, to post a major upset, 75-66, before 6,506 at the Mullins
Center last night. As the clock was winding down in regulation as
well as in overtime, the UMass players were looking around for
someone to take the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson improved to 5-5, but its other wins came against
ordinary teams Bowdoin, Elon, Southwest Texas State, and Washington
College.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats outrebounded the Minutemen, 45-38, scored 52 points
in the paint, and had 16 off second-chances. UMass, which fell to
3-6, was a mere 6 of 20 from the field the second half, and did not
score a field goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack had 24 points for UMass, 20 in the first half. Ben
Ebong flipped in 17 for Davidson, one of four Wildcats in double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our themes for the past three weeks has been chip away,
chip away, keep chipping away, and if we could define the story, it
was chip away,'' said Davidson coach Bob McKillop. ``Look at the
clock and look at the score. A 15-point lead was now 10, and 10 was
now 5 and all of a sudden we were going for a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass was evil from the foul line, hitting only 17 of 33
attempts. In one stretch, it missed 10 consecutive free throws.
Lari Ketner was 6 of 15 from the stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to score and the ball gets tight,'' said UMass
coach Bruiser Flint, whose team had 14 turnovers, 11 the second
half. ``We've talked about making plays the entire year. We need a
foul shot, make a foul shot. We need a rebound, get a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it, we were scared to shoot it the second half.
We would pass out to guys and we were right under the basket.''
</P>

   Playing a variety of defenses, Davidson got within 10 points,
47-37, on a Landry Kosmalski layup with 15:33 left in regulation.
Then it was down to 5, 52-47, with Kosmalski putting in the rebound
of a missed free throw. Finally, with 1:45 left, Ebong made his
third straight field goal, tying it at 62-62. Davidson had the last
shot in regulation, but point guard Ali Ton missed a 3-pointer.

   UMass then had its problems in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hesitated because it was missing shots and it was
compounded by missing foul shots and the groans in the stands go
up,'' McKillop said. ``They heard that and they didn't want to hear
the groans again. They felt failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint wonders about his senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're 3-6, somebody's got to step up and do
something,'' the UMass coach said. ``We have poor leadership. The
big rebound, the big shot, the big foul shot, who will make them?
Somebody's got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass's Atlantic 10 opener is Saturday.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Miss Florida USA, 25 marching bands and a
NASCAR stock car will parade in honor of the newly inaugurated Gov.
Jeb Bush on Tuesday ahead of a symbol of Florida's new domination
by Republicans: a circus elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for all Floridians,'' said inaugural parade Chairman
Rusty Price of the one hour, 45 minute march through downtown
Tallahassee. ``We think it will be the most exciting one yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade has 87 elements in it, from Florida Highway Patrol
motorcycles to the families of Bush; his lieutenant governor, Frank
Brogan; a marching band composed of musicians from South Fork and
Martin County high schools (Brogan was once Martin County schools
superintendent); the six Cabinet members; the seven Supreme Court
justices; Florida A&AMP;M University's famous Marching 100; the
Budweiser Clydesdales; the Port St. Lucie Jazz Band; and the
BellSouth stock car of Lakeland's Joe Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear will be a pachyderm from Sarasota-based
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus _ in honor of the first
time since Reconstruction that Florida will simultaneously have a
Republican governor, Senate president and House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, George and Barbara Bush will attend their son's
swearing in on the Old Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Graham, a longtime friend of the Bush family,
will give the invocation and benediction.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, to start at 1:30, will be only one event in the
``Florida Festival,'' the final day of Bush's three-day
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   A prayer breakfast is planned at FAMU at 7 a.m.; the swearing-in
ceremony will take place at noon; a Governor's Mansion open house
is to start at 2 p.m. along with a street fair; and a laser light
show down Adams Street will wrap up the day at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   All events are free and open to the public.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ As another cool, foggy morning dawned over beignets
and coffee in the French Quarter, there was the story in the sports
section of the paper, staring up in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   It told of Peyton Manning, the local hero, returning to his
hometown after a rookie season in the NFL that had been filled with
impressive numbers and glowing compliments, along with the first
payments in a six-year, $48 million contract from the Indianapolis
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   If you were like most readers from the Garden District to the
Irish Channel, you might have nodded your head at young Manning's
good fortune and absent-mindedly rubbed your shoulder, wondering
what it would be like to be able to throw a football for such a
cozy living.
</P>
<P>
   If you were like Branndon Stewart, believing you have the arm
and all the talent, you might have shook your head in disgust at
what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   But not if you really were Branndon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``People misread me and my emotions,'' the Texas A&AMP;M quarterback
said. ``They seem to have made up their minds how I'm supposed to
feel _ maybe it's how they believe they would feel in my place _
and that's made for some things that have been said and written
about me that are just wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe things haven't worked out during the past few years the
way a lot of other people thought they would. But that hasn't made
me angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrets about my college years? Yeah, I have one. I broke up
with my girlfriend for about eight months. Now we're back together,
and that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest? Well, you have to understand that I'm a very
religious person, and I believe that whatever happens is God's
will. He has a plan for me, and it will eventually become clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had his own plan back in 1994. Having quarterbacked
Stephenville High to a 16-0 record and the Texas state
championship, he was going to enroll at Tennessee and compete for a
job with this other hotshot passer named Manning.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of bad decisions, it was like putting all your
money into the development of the 8-track tape player or the
Betamax. And it would create a permanent link between the two young
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was naive,'' Stewart said. ``There weren't many kids at my
little high school who had gone on to play college football at the
Division I level. I didn't really know anything about how it worked
or what would happen. I figured that things would unfold slowly,
that I would get to Tennessee and be an understudy for a couple of
years and then get a chance to compete as a starter as a junior or
senior. I guess I didn't understand the pressures and the realities
of big-time college football.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tennessee, where the Volunteers play before crowds of 106,000
at Neyland Stadium, nothing is slow in unfolding, and the
competition between Stewart and Manning over who would run the
offense for four years began immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart played in 11 of 12 games his freshman season, but the
handwriting was on the wall, and he transferred to A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because I didn't think I had the talent to compete,'' he
said. ``I could see how things were going. I think Peyton was
probably more advanced than me in terms of understanding offenses,
reading defenses. It was just best that I went elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, returning home to Texas to play for the Aggies
brought different kinds of pressure from fans, most of whom
believed his arm was going to carry them to national championships
and some of whom even went so far as to label him a bust after he
lost the starting job to Randy McCown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, the Aggies are in the Sugar Bowl to face Ohio State in
large part because of Stewart and his 324-yard, three-touchdown
performance in the Big 12 championship win over Kansas State when
McCown was sidelined with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit ironic, perhaps, that in a city where so many broken
dreams have been washed down Bourbon Street, Stewart has come to
fulfill his.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I thought the college experience would be like,''
he said. ``Some ups, some downs, a learning thing. I came to go to
school, to have some fun, to play some football. I've done all
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd love to give the NFL a try. That's up to whether
somebody wants to give me a chance. I see Peyton on TV, and I see
other quarterbacks, and I believe I can do those things. If it
doesn't happen, my life will go on in a different way. No anger. No
jealousy. No regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people might not want to believe this, but I got
everything I expected out of my college career.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, an education.
