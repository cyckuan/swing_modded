<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Refutes U.S. Religious Freedom Panel Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Sun Yuxi said here Wednesday that the Chinese Government and
people deeply resent and firmly oppose the slanderous report
issued this week by a U.S. religious rights commission.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the so-called annual report, released Monday by the U.
S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, has wantonly
interfered in China's internal affairs and deeply hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people, and they firmly oppose it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the section of the report concerning
China has "distorted the facts" and "confounded black and white".
</P>
<P>
It groundlessly attacked China's policy on religion and the
Chinese Government's banning of the Falun Gong cult in accordance
with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the commission recommended that the United
States deny any bid by China to host the Olympics and that it "
grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status only
after China makes substantial improvement in regard to religious
freedom," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The report also asks that the U.S. Government continue to put
forward anti-China bills in the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese Government protects its citizens'
religious freedom in accordance with law, and as in any other
country that upholds the rule by law, religious people in China
must abide by the law.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong is not a religious organization but an evil cult
that has seriously harmed the safety of the Chinese society and
people, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
By banning the Falun Gong cult according to law, the Chinese
Government has safeguarded the basic human rights and freedom of
the broad masses, and maintained the rule of law, he said. The
Government's action is therefore firmly supported by the whole
Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has no
right whatsoever to accuse China on matters concerning religion
and Falun Gong," Sun said. The vicious motives of the commission's
report will never be realized.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, China is asking the U.S. Government to stop
interfering in China's internal affairs by using religious matters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Government should take practical measures to do away
with the bad influences of the report and avoid creating any new
trouble and obstacles to Sino-U.S. relations that are at a crucial
moment now, he said.

<HEADLINE> Seven UN Peacekeepers Killed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. peacekeeping force surrounded
former Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh's home in capital
Freetown after seven of their colleagues were killed by Sankoh's
followers, reports reaching here said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the UN peacekeeping force stationed there said
that Sankoh was "under the protection of UN troops".
</P>
<P>
The seven soldiers were killed and three others wounded by
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) headed by Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
They were among the 49 U.N. soldiers and some civilian
personnel taken hostage by the RUF fighters in three separate
incidents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time U.N. peacekeepers have been killed in
Sierra Leone since they were deployed in the west African country
in April to enforce a peace deal signed by the warring parties in
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission in Sierra Leone, while condemning the killing,
said "many others are not traceable due to the fluid situation".
</P>
<P>
In a statement in Paris earlier, UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan expressed his "outrage at the continuing deliberate attacks
on United Nations personnel in Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
Annan said Sankoh was to blame for the attacks and that he
should be held accountable.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Invited to Attend Islamic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday received a letter from Qatari Prince Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa Al-Thani, inviting him to attend the summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held in Qatar in
November, reported the official Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
INA did not say whether Saddam, who has never travelled abroad
since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
The letter was conveyed by visiting Qatari Minister of Royal
Ceremonies Sheikh Mohammed Ben Fahad Al-Thani during his meeting
with Saddam, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iraq and Qatar have been steadily improving in
recent years. Qatar, one of the six member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), has reopened its embassy in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad, which was closed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Three other GCC member states, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates, have also renewed diplomatic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The other two GCC members, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are arch
rivals of Iraq in the Gulf war and have not rehabilitated ties with
Saddam Hussein's regime.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Arrives in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
arrived Thursday in Colombia, where he will sign with his
counterpart, Andres Pastrana, a plan of bilateral action.
</P>
<P>
Chavez was received by Pastrana at the airport of Santa Marta,
the capital of the Magdalena department, 1,000 kilometers north of
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan chief of state came accompanied by Venezuelan
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel.
</P>
<P>
The visit will last some five hours and at the end of their
private meeting both presidents will sign a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Rangel and his Colombian
counterpart, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, concurred in saying that
the relations between the two countries are going through an
excellent moment.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that the relations went through difficult
moments, but "we were able to build a relation on the basis of
understanding and confidence."
</P>
<P>
The presidents will sign during this meeting a plan of action
with concrete dates and transcendental decisions for the relations
between Venezuela and Colombia, said the Colombian foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Both chiefs of state will reactivate the bilateral commission
set up 10 years ago in charge of the solution of border
controversies.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana and Chavez will inaugurate the new sessions of the
binational commission of neighborhood and will announce the names
of its members.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became tense last year when
Chavez said that he was ready to meet with the Colombian rebels,
which was criticized by the Pastrana government.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan foreign minister said that the country maintains
itself as a facilitating force for the peace negotiations between
the Pastrana government and the two Colombian rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to involve myself in matters of Colombian
internal politics, but we are a facilitating force for
understanding and dialogue between Colombians, because peace in
Colombia means peace in Venezuela," said Rangel.
</P>
<P>
The Pastrana government started a peace dialogue with the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and started contacts
with the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the biggest guerrilla organization in Colombia, and
the ELN the second.

<HEADLINE> Bug Hits Computers Across World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By midday Thursday, the self-propagating and destructive "
ILOVEYOU" virus had already wrought hundreds of millions of
dollars in software damage and lost commerce in the United States,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The virus was first reported in Hong Kong and spread gradually
west, infecting government and business computers.
</P>
<P>
The "ILOVEYOU" virus is currently known to spread through the
Microsoft Outlook e-mail program and through a popular Internet
Relay Chat program.
</P>
<P>
According to ICSA.net, the malicious code is a hybrid virus and
worm. Like the Melissa and Explore.Zip worms, it propagates itself
through networks, and in this case, through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
But unlike those two, it also destroys and replicates itself by
manipulating files on a user's hard drive, like a traditional
virus.
</P>
<P>
The virus was reportedly widespread at the U.S. Senate computer
system and forced the Senate to shut down its internal e-mail
system. The White House and federal agencies reported minimal
effects.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun
investigating the virus.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At the ongoing talks between
Ethiopia and Eritrea in Algiers, the Ethiopian government is
refusing to sign the Framework Agreement and the Modalities of
Implementation, Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a press release
available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The release issued by the ministry Wednesday said that the two
documents are substantive ones of the peace plan of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) for ending the two-year border
war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The release said Ethiopia "had earlier rejected the details and
 sequencing of implementation incorporated in the Technical

<P>
The Ethiopian delegation is headed by Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin and his counterpart Haile Voldensae heads the Eritrean
delegation. It is reported that there will be on face-to-face
meeting between the two sides.

Mocumbi told a weekly press briefing that, however, donors'
promises are one thing, the time it may take for them to
materialize is quite another.
</P>

He said that at a donors conference in Rome, the Mozambican

According to a Reuters report, international donors pledged

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Iran to Free All Remaining Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq urged Iran to release all its
prisoners of war (POWs) after Tehran set free another batch of 480
Iraqis on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes those Iraqi POWs "still languish in Iranian jails"
will all be freed, said Fahmi Al-Qaisi, chairman of the Iraq-Iran
War Victims Committee.
</P>
<P>
Starting from April 9, Iran allowed 1,999 Iraqi POWs, kept since
their war ended in 1988, to return to their home in four batches as
a good-will gesture to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi official said Iran still holds some 9,000
Iraqi POWs registered by the International Committee Red Cross
(ICRC), in addition to other thousands not registered or concealed
from the international humanitarian organization.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has been negotiating the release of Iraqi POWs with the
Iranian government, which earlier this year allowed an ICRC
delegation to visit Iraqi POWs that had not been seen before.
</P>
<P>
Since last February, the ICRC has been registering Iraqi POWs at
a rate of 50 a day in efforts to repatriate them back to Iraq,
according to Al-Qaisi.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been a major hurdle hampering a
normalization of Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
Before the unilateral move by Iran to release Iraqi POWs, Iraq
claimed that Iran still held more than 13,000 Iraqi POWs, while
Tehran says more than 2,800 Iranian POWs are still in Iraqi
custody.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors fought a bloody war from 1980-1988, in which
some 1 million people from both sides lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran negotiated the exchange of POWs for many years.
Since 1991, they have swapped some 90,000 POWs as part of the
effort to normalize relations.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Wounded by Katyusha Rockets From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were wounded
in northern Israel Thursday afternoon in several waves of Katyusha
rocket attacks launched from Lebanon, Israel Army Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Israelis sustained light to moderate injuries, with
some of them being transferred to nearby hospitals, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
It was the fiercest attack against the area since the beginning
of the year, a signal that the security situation there might
deteriorate before the planned withdrawal of Israeli troops from
south Lebanon this July, according to local observers.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information about damage, but several
rockets reportedly landed in the Israeli border town of Kiryat
Shemona, causing fire.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the rocket attacks, Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
in the area had urged local residents to enter into bomb shelters
or basements.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, who have been fighting against
Israeli occupation in the so-called security zone in south Lebanon,
had claimed responsibility for firing nearly 40 Katyushas at
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, often
fires the Russian-made rockets at northern Israel in retaliation
for Israeli attacks in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tension has already been gripping in the area since Wednesday as
an pilot of Israel Air Force dropped a 300-kilogram bomb "by error"
on the outskirts of a Lebanese village, north of the security zone,
wounding 12 Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese civilians and three guerrillas were also killed in
separate Israeli air raids early Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Unconditional Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Lebanese delegate said
Thursday that Israel should unconditionally withdraw its troops to
the line prior to the 1967 Middle East war, which was then
internationally recognized and actually controlled by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Ali Hariri, head of the Lebanese
delegation, at the general debate session of on-going 103rd
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the planned Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon
would not only be a victory for the Lebanese people, but also for
the Arab world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to quit by July south Lebanon it invaded and
occupied for 22 years, due to mounting casualties. It becomes more
likely that the pullout will be unilateral, because chances for
Israel to reach a peace deal with Lebanon and its main power broker
Syria before the target date seemed slim.
</P>
<P>
Hariri stressed that his country believed Israel must make peace
with Lebanon and Syria simultaneously, and neither Lebanon nor
Syria will sign a peace deal with the Jewish state if the other is
not doing the same.
</P>
<P>
He said it was only natural that Lebanon would not commit itself
to any security arrangements for Israel under the current
circumstances, as only a just and comprehensive peace in the region
would guarantee securities for all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Israel`s peace talks with Syria remained deadlocked over the
return of the Golan Heights. Syria demands a full withdrawal of
Israel troops from the Golan its captured in the 1967 Middle East
war, which Israel rejects.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said Lebanon would insist on its demand for compensation
from Israel for damage inflicted during its occupation, for the
release of Lebanese prisoners of war and other detainees, as well
as for the rights of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to return to
their homeland in the occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
On the peace keeping efforts by the United Nations in Lebanon,
Hariri said that any redeployment or reinforcements of the U.N.
peace keepers should be subjected to approval from Lebanese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On international economy, Hariri appealed to Arab attendants at
the IPU session for support for the establishment of an common Arab
market in the Middle east, but he stressed that Arab should take a
cautious and "step by step" attitude toward economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd IPU conference, attended by a record 138 delegations
with some 1,400 representatives, opened here on Sunday to discuss
world peace and security as well as ways of promoting dialogue
between different cultures and civilizations. It is expected to
close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
IPU, founded in 1889 and now with 144 members, is the largest
international parliamentary organization, and its biannual
conferences serve as an important venue for parliamentary
diplomacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and another one
injured Thursday in two separate road accidents in Egypt, a
security official said.
</P>
<P>
In an accident taking place on the Cairo-Alexandria desert road,
a speeding truck rammed from behind into a trailer-truck which was
parking on the roadside, the unnamed official of the Interior
Ministry was quoted as saying by the country's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck behind and his helper were killed in the
collision, the official said, adding that both vehicles were
severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
The other incident happened on a highway in Minya Governorate,
220 kilometers south of Cairo, when a truck hit a car while trying
to overtake it.
</P>
<P>
The car overturned and the 17-year-old driver, a student, and
his three companions were killed. A woman who happened to be nearby
was injured.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt as people drive cars at high
speed and neglect traffic rules and regulations. Local media have
dubbed rural highways "roads of death."

BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel freed six Lebanese detainees
Thursday noon from Heyaam prison in the Israeli-occupied zone in
south Lebanon, Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The six people, who live in the occupied zone, were removed from
Heyaam by Red Cross' car to the city of Nabatiye.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel released 13 Lebanese detainees in accordance
with the Israeli High Court's decision.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 Lebanese imprisoned by Israel for years without any
trial are said to be used as bargaining chips for exchanging
Israel's missing air force navigator Ron Arad, who is allegedly
held by the Lebanese resistance groups fighting to drive Israeli
occupation troops out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud told visiting United Nations
envoy Roed Larsen Thursday morning that Israel should release all
Lebanese detainees when it pulls out its troops from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> AL, EU to Discuss Ways of Advancing Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) and the European
Union (EU) will hold discussion here Tuesday on ways of pushing
forward the Middle East peace process, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid will meet Miguel
Moratinos, EU's special envoy for Mideast affairs, on Tuesday to
discuss EU's role in helping advance the peace process on the
Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The EU wants to play a role in mediating the peace talks between
Arab countries and Israel. Moratinos often visits the region to get
acquainted with the views of the concerned parties and sell EU's
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos will brief Abdel-Meguid on the latest efforts exerted
by the 15-nation European bloc to help narrow the differences in
the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the news agency quoted an
unnamed AL official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two regional organizations agree to coordinate their efforts
and consult on the developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is currently on a regional tour, which has taken him
to Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. He is due to arrive in Cairo on
Monday after visits to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has entered a crucial stage as Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators are discussing the thorniest issues
between them, and the Jewish state has decided to withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon by July with or without an agreement with
Syria which has called for a full Israeli pullout from the
strategic Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Call for International Support for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday renewed his appeal to the United
States and European and Arab countries to help push forward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the guardians of the peace accords, namely the United
States and European countries to move quickly (to push forward the
peace process)," Arafat said upon his return here from a Gulf tour
that took him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Arafat termed the tour and his talks with leaders of the
regional countries as "very important". He noted that he briefed
the leaders on the nature of the problems confronting the peace
talks and the Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks which entered the
fifth day in Israel's Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Thursday deal
with the final Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, the fate of
Jerusalem, borders, water resources and the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinians said the talks showed a big gap between the
positions of Israel and the PNA, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
admitted that it was difficult for the two sides to reach a
framework agreement on the final status by mid-May as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to shuttle between Jerusalem and Gaza in an
effort to bring the positions of the two sides closer and arrange
for a summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ross expressed hope that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would take part in a later stage of the talks if
there were some progress in the underway talks.

<HEADLINE> 4 Mission U.N. Peacekeepers Feared Dead in Sierra Leone  (Updated with more details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations spokesman
told Xinhua here Thursday morning that there are four U.N.
peacekeepers missing in Sierra Leone, and they are "presumably
dead."
</P>
<P>
This marks a reduction in casualties on the U.N. side. The
United Nations reported Wednesday that seven U.N. peacekeepers
were killed in the clash Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The previous report of 7 deaths appears inaccurate," the
spokesman said. "It is really a good news."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was recovered," U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a
news conference here. "We have no information on the releases."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who returned to New York
Thursday morning at the end of his Africa tour, is in contact with
relevant parties to secure the early release of the detainees, she
said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the U.N. Headquarters in New York is waiting
for further information on the casualties and injuries on the U.N.
side after a fighting between U.N. peacekeepers and former rebels
in the northern part of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in the Makeni and Magburaka areas.
U.N. officials said that the number could increase and stressed
that the death toll and other casualty figures could fluctuate
with the fluidity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
One U.N. peacekeeper from India had been released so far.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that another peacekeeper from Malaysia was
freed, but the reports cannot be confirmed here.
</P>
<P>
United Nations officials said that 21 of the captives,
including three military observers, were taken in the Makeni-
Magburaka area. Twenty-eight others, who were seized in the
eastern town of Kailahun, include two civilian employees and four
members of a helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
News from the crisis areas reaches the United Nations slowly
because of poor communications and renewed fighting, U.N.
officials said, so the numbers and identities of the dead or
captured may change.
</P>
<P>
The 8,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNAMSIL,
was dispatched into the West African country to monitor a cease-
fire under a peace accord signed by the Government and rebels to
end the eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, rebels began seizing U.N. staff in Makeni,
Magburaka and Kailhun, the towns in central and eastern Sierra
Leone. The initial clashes began after the United Nations refused
to return to the RUF 10 rebel fighters who had come to a U.N.
disarmament center to turn in their arms.
</P>
<P>
RUF leader Foday Sankoh, held directly responsible by the
United Nations for the crisis, agreed Wednesday night to free any
hostages held by his group. But Sankoh has made the similar
promises in the past and it remains unclear exactly when or if the
U.N. hostages would be released.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Teenagers May Suffer Mental Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Mental disorders can begin in teenage
years and afflict many sufferers for the rest of their lives,
according to a new psychiatric study published in the latest issue
of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
"Mental illness suddenly bulks very large indeed. All
predictions are that the future will bring a dramatic increase in
mental problems. It is a crisis of the 21st century," WHO Director-
General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland said in an editorial of the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
In a press release here Thursday, WHO said that its
International Consortium in Psychiatric Epidemiology examined data
from 30,000 people in seven countries, Brazil, Canada, Germany,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United States. Researchers
found that 48 percent of those studied in the U.S. experienced at
least one disorder in their lifetime, compared to 40 percent in
the Netherlands, 38 percent in Germany, 37 percent in Canada, 36
percent in Brazil, 20 percent in Mexico and 12 percent in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the median age of onset for anxiety disorders was just
15 years, 21 years for substance use disorders and 26 years for
mood disorders. Delays in seeking treatment were especially
pervasive among people with early onset of symptoms. All three
classes of illness were most common in disadvantaged sectors of
society, and linked particularly to people with low income and
below-average education, or who were unemployed or unmarried.
</P>
<P>
Anxiety disorders were most likely of the three to become
chronic, and more common in women than men, as were mood disorders.
Substance use disorders were more common among men.
</P>
<P>
In her editorial, Brundtland mentioned several reasons why
effective treatment for disorders such as depression is not
provided.
</P>
<P>
"The main reasons are the low priority given to mental health,
the traditional centralization of mental health services in large,
ineffective and often downright harmful psychiatric institutions,
and poor application of cost-effective mental health strategies,"
she said. "There is also the stigma of mental illness, which
inhibits sufferers from seeking treatment, and which may even
limit the willingness of mental health care providers to intervene.
"
</P>
<P>
The WHO chief pointed out that mental health depends on some
measure of social justice and mental illness must be treated
effectively at primary level where possible. She has identified
mental health as one of WHO' main priority areas. The annual World
Health Report will be devoted to mental health in its 2001 issue.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: 720 Bln Dlrs Involved in FDI-Linked Cross-Border Merging in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cross-border mergers and acquisitions
(M&AMP;As) resulted in the acquisition of more than 10 percent of the
equity of foreign firms in 1999 to reach 720 billion U.S. dollars
on a completed transaction basis, according to new statistics made
public here Thursday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
These statistics are new compared to other available cross-
border M&AMP;A statistics, in that they correspond more closely to the
commonly accepted definition of foreign direct investment (FDI) as
far as the equity threshold is concerned, and that the values are
for completed M&AMP;As only, said the UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
However, the new UNCTAD statistics do include M&AMP;As financed by
funds that are raised in local and international financial markets;
nor is the value measured on a net basis as in the balance-of-
payments concept underlying the measurement of FDI, the UNCTAD
said, adding that for these reasons, the value of the cross-border
M&AMP;As cannot be calculated as a percentage of total FDI flows.
</P>
<P>
Still, the UNCTAD believes that cross-border M&AMP;As are a driving
force behind recent growth of FDI flows, which reached an
estimated 827 billion dollars in 1999. Foreign investment through
M&AMP;As has been increasingly regarded by transnational corporations
as a strategy to enhance the core competence of their corporate
systems. Therefore, FDI flows and cross-border M&AMP;As have followed
a parallel path in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the different areas, the UNCTAD noted that western
European firms expanded their cross-border M&AMP;A activity the most
in 1999. The United States was the single country with the largest
value of sales. In developing countries, cross-border M&AMP;A sales
fell in 1999. This decline was largely caused by fewer
privatizations in Latin America where the value of cross-border M&AMP;
As fell from 64 billion dollars in 1998 to 37 billion dollars in
1999.
</P>
<P>
In developing Asia, cross-border M&AMP;As continued to grow in 1999.
In particular, cross-border M&AMP;As in the five Asian economies most
affected by the financial crisis were still on the rise, growing
in value from 11 billion dollars in 1998 to 15 billion dollars in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkish PM Statement on Aegean Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday criticized the
statement made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit concerning
the two neighboring countries' disputes over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The scenery in the relations between Greece and Turkey was
clear, and Turkey should not make attempts to make it foggy, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in a response to Ecevit'
s statement.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the only issue existing between the two
countries was the legal issue of the continental shelf in the
Aegean that could be settled by the International Court of Justice
in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Reppas also urged Turkey to respect the commitments it had
undertaken at the European Union's Helsinki summit last December.
</P>
<P>
Turkey must prove in practice that it wanted to be on an equal
basis with the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, the spokesman said that it would be
handled within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ecevit reportedly said that for the time being
there had been no encouraging step on the part of Greece for
peaceful dialogue on the issue of the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish premier also noted that the Cyprus issue should be
examined independently from the problem of the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been
at odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean,
and the Cyprus problem, but the two countries have since last June
begun to improve their strained relations with the holding of
several rounds of low-level talks and the signing of a series of
bilateral cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lashes at Havel Remarks on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday criticized Czech
President Vaclav Havel for his remarks on Chechnya, accusing him
of doubting Russia's territorial integrity and trying to justify
separatism and terrorism in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by what the newspaper Lidowe Nowiny reports," Havel "
made a number of remarkable statements to journalists during the
meeting of Central European countries' leaders in Budapest on
April 29," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Havel reportedly said that "Chechnya has not always belonged to
Russia; nor has it belonged to it for very long" and that it is up
to the Chechens to decide whether they want to be "part of this
empire or not," the ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also quoted Havel as saying that military actions
in Chechnya "are carried out against the people, not against
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
"Not only the Czech president tried to justify separatism and
terrorism historically this way, but he actually questioned the
territorial integrity of Russia by recommending it "to realize
where it begins and where it ends," the Russian statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the first time the head of the Czech state
sympathizes with those who are really guilty of the Chechen people
's tragedy and of the pain of the whole of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Discusses JSF Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cabinet ministers of Belgium
Thursday started to discuss the country's participation in the
Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.
</P>
<P>
Critics here said that government officials were reluctant to
join the costly United States-led development program of a new
generation of fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Belgium estimated that it would have to pay 5 billion Belgian
francs (110 million U.S. dollars) to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin and Boeing are each designing a version of the
Joint Strike Fighter, an advanced model of stealth jet that is
expected to net production orders of over 3,000 planes from the
United States and its allies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, Lockheed Chief Executive Vance Coffman told an
aerospace conference in New York that the Pentagon is likely to
split an order worth upwards of 200 billion dollars for the new
fighter jet between his company and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, however, have so far said that they would
award the entire contract to one of the two competitors with the
other playing a supporting role in production.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's cabinet discussion, Belgian government
opinion was against the JSF option. The country's Budget Minister
Johan Vande Lanotte said that there was a growing consensus within
the cabinet that Belgium should not choose the JSF program but
rather invest in cargo planes that can be used for humanitarian
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will continue to discuss Belgium's long-term
military spending.
</P>
<P>
The European allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
have been called upon to increase their military spending so as to
catch up with the United States and to build an European Security
and Defense Identity.
</P>
<P>
The 78-day air strikes against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia last year exposed the appalling gap between the United
States and its European allies in combat capabilities such as
intelligence, airlift and precision weaponry.

<HEADLINE> 32 Russian Servicemen Killed Last Week in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 32 servicemen from the
Russian defense and interior ministries were killed in Chechnya in
the week to Thursday, a top Kremlin spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential aide on Chechnya, said
107 federal servicemen were wounded during the period.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports bring the total federal losses to 2,213 men
dead and 6,495 men wounded, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 52 rebels were killed in the breakaway republic. The
federal troops also destroyed nine vehicles, three cannons and
mortars, 12 bases, 17 arms and ammunition depots and two
communications and radar sites of the rebels, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign against rebels last
September following two waves of armed Chechen incursions into
neighboring Dagestan and a series of terrorist bombings, which
were also blamed on Chechen militants, that left some 300 people
dead in Moscow and two other cities.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea of Delaying Conflict Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Thursday rejected
categorically Eritrea's accusation that it refused to sign the
documents of the Framework Agreement and the Modalities of
Implementation, parts of peace plan sponsored by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
A senior Ethiopian government official, who asked not to be
identified, told Xinhua that instead of discussing the disputes
over technical arrangements which is part of the OAU package of
peace plan, at Algiers proximity talks, Eritrea proposed to sign
the documents of the framework agreement and the modalities of
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"The Eritreans brought new ideas that has not been identical
to what we have agreed before," the official said, noting "The
modalities and framework are actually something that the two
sides agreed no need to sign."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Eritrea's allegation that Ethiopia rejects
cease-fire at the indirect talks, the official said ceasefire is
part of the whole package of peace plan which Eritrea refuses to
accept.
</P>
<P>
Because of Eritrea's preconditions, the proximity talks could
not come up to substance, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the proximity talks kicked off last
Sunday, which is one day delay because the Eritrean delegation
failed to arrive on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998 due to
border disputes. The OAU, together with some countries and
international organizations, have been trying to mediate between
the two warring countries, but no breakthrough has been made yet.

</P>
<P>
Ismail Tutwamoto Lubenga, DRC minister of State for External

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Pledges S.Africa Won't Follow Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki on Thursday moved to debunk fears that his country would
follow Zimbabwe in land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
In a special address to the nation in which he repeated his
preference for quiet diplomacy, Mbeki noted that organized South
African agriculture had resisted the temptation to assume "a
counter-productive, holier-than- thou attitude" towards Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African whites voiced fears that the Zimbabwe
land crisis could spill over into South Africa and urged Mbeki
to condemn Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's speech, which was broadcast live, came in the wake of
continued opposition party condemnation of South Africa's
"silence" on Zimbabwe, international calls for bolder
intervention, and pressure on the rand.
</P>
<P>
He said these fears were driven by racism and the view "you
have these black governments in this region and therefore they
will behave in the same way".
</P>
<P>
Mbeki praised South African commercial farmers for their
constructive and "enormously valuable role" in helping resolve
the Zimbabwean land question. He did not elaborate. A group of
South African businessmen, including farmers, had visited
Zimbabwe to offer aid.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of South Africa's agricultural land is
owned by an estimated 60,000 white commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
"By this means, they have also contributed to the fight
against the mischievous effort to create and feed a psychosis of
fear in our own country, based on nothing else but racist
prejudices, assumptions and objectives," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"This they have done while recognizing the challenges we face
with regard to the land question in our own country, as well as
the troubled human and labor relations on some of our commercial
farms, " he said. .
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the media, this time for failing to fully
report his public statements on Zimbabwe on at least three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
 Mbeki said the government, together with commercial farmers
and other compatriots, "will work persistently and without making
the noise of empty drums, to help the sister people of Zimbabwe to
find a just and lasting solution to the real and pressing land
question in their country".
</P>
<P>
Mbeki repeated that South Africa's policy towards Africa was
aimed at helping secure a better life for all.

JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An international grain trading
house in South Africa is to export between 50,000 to 70,000 tons
of South African maize to Japan for delivery in July.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association quoted market sources as
saying on Thursday that the consignment would be a mix of yellow
and white maize with more yellow in the shipment than white. The
report, however, did not mention the name of the trading house.

This shipment is the first major export consignment out of
South Africa coming from the current 1999/2000 commercial maize
crop, which has been estimated at 9.198 million tons -- equating
to an exportable surplus of 1.5 to 2 million tons.

taken hostage on Tuesday, reports reaching here from the west

He said that six RUF combatants had been killed in the clashes,

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim Thursday strongly
condemned the killing and abduction of the United Nations
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to condemn in no uncertain terms these wanton acts,"
Salim said in a statement, noting these acts, which were carried
out by members the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Sierra
Leone, are in violation of their obligations under the Lome Peace
Agreement of July 7, 1999.

<P>
The OAU chief called on the RUF to meet their obligations under
the Lome Agreement by participating fully in the on-going
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.

He also urged the RUF to allow UN peacekeepers and humanitarian
workers and civilians to enter its controlled areas and to pursue
the path of dialogue in the context of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Growers Urged to Sell Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
Thursday urged growers to bring various grades of tobacco to the
auction floors.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of tobacco to the floors has been slow since the
starting of the selling season two weeks ago due to the invasion
of white commercial farms by war veterans who are demanding
redistribution of land.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the main tobacco exporters in the world.
Tobacco is the country's top foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Richard Tate said
in a statement more tobacco was being booked in for sale at the
floors and this would enable consistent and full deliveries of
tobacco to the auction floors.
</P>
<P>
"Growers are encouraged to bring various grades to the floors
for our overseas customers and sales are expected to be in full
swing in the immediate future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had an excellent tobacco crop of about 220
million kilograms of high quality leaf including a wide range of
grades to satisfy international buyers.
</P>
<P>
Marketing Manager of the Tobacco Sales Floor Brenda Mee said a
total of 3,926 bales were sold at the sales floor at an average
price of 1.15 U.S. dollars per kilograms on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mee said a total of 14,398 bales have so far been sold at an
average price of 1.16 U.S. dollars per kilogram at the floor
since the starting of the selling season.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservatives Keep on Vote Recounting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's election watchdog, the
Guardians Council, announced on Thursday that vote-recounting in
Tehran constituency for the February parliamentary elections will
continue because errors have been found.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the conservative-dominated council said that
votes in 140 ballot boxes have been recounted since May 1, proving
contradictions in the number of votes already announced, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,022 votes were found for former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani in one ballot box in which the number of votes for
Rafsanjani had been put at zero, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Vote-counting immediately after the elections showed that
Rafsanjani, head of the powerful advisory State Expediency Council
opposed by reformists for siding with hardliners, secured only the
last seat in the 30-seat Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The preceding 29 seats were won by reformist candidates allied
with President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The council said it had recounted half of the ballot-boxes, and
would finish the other half in order to get the correct result in
the biggest and most important constituency.
</P>
<P>
It ordered the third recounting of part of the ballot boxes in
the constituency last month after some candidates complained of
possible vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
But the council's delay to confirm the election result in Tehran
was seen as a tactic to contain the reformists, who won a landslide
victory in the elections, humiliating the powerful conservatives
who still control most of the sensitive state organs.
</P>
<P>
The reformist coalition "the May 23 Front" has rejected the
possibility of vote rigging, and has urged the council to clarify
the result in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
"The matter of vote rigging in Tehran is out of the question,
because representatives of the Interior Ministry and the Guardians
Council were monitoring the election while the votes were being
cast and they were also present during vote counting," the
coalition's spokesman Behzad Nabavi said.
</P>
<P>
The council has nullified the results in 12 constituencies,
barring nine reformists from entering the Majlis and forcing others
to the runoff to be held on Friday in 52 constituencies for 66
seats.
</P>
<P>
Khatami on Wednesday urged the council to clarify the
parliamentary election result in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated judiciary has shut down almost all
the major reformist newspapers, which played an important role in
the reformists' sweeping success in the polls in February.
</P>
<P>
The defiant reformist camp, however, vowed to win the remaining
seats in the runoff despite their voice was silenced.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan Closer to Solving Refugees Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees Sadako Ogata said here Thursday that her visit to
Bhutan and Nepal has helped towards ending the difficulties in the
process of bilateral classification of the Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ogata told a press conference that the governments of Bhutan
and Nepal have accepted the proposal to commence the
classification of the refugees on the basis of the data prepared
by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the commitment and keenness shown by the
governments of Nepal and Bhutan in resolving the Bhutanese
refugees problem at the earliest possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said that a bilateral accord on initiating the
classification process should come up from a new round of foreign
minister level talks to be held later this month to resolve the
refugees problem.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugees were divided into four categories in the
first round of ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan in 1993.
The four categories are: bonafide Bhutanese who were forcibly
evicted, Bhutanese who emigrated on compelling circumstances, non-
Bhutanese and Bhutanese with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
However, the procedure of the classification has been an
obstacle to the resolution of the refugees problem. The Nepali
government proposed to go on the verification family by family,
while the Bhutanese side insisted on verifying every refugee.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have failed so far to reach any agreement on the
repatriation of the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees who were evicted
from Bhutan in early 1990s and are now living in seven refugee
camps in eastern Nepal managed by UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Ogata arrived here Monday for a four-day official visit to
Nepal after completing her visit to Bhutan on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Dawn-to-Dusk Hartal Observed in Chittagong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The dawn-to-dusk hartal (general
strike), enforced by the four-party alliance led by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), passed off peacefully Thursday in
Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh, the official
Bangladesh News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The alliance called the hartal in protest against what it
alleged "opposition-less Chittagong City Corporation election.
</P>
<P>
The hartal supporters blasted several hand-made bombs in
different areas of the city, but no one was injured, police and
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Governmental, semi-governmental and civil bodies functioned
with satisfactory attendance, educational institutions remained
closed, while shops and other business establishments partially
transacted their daily affairs.
</P>
<P>
Inside activities at the Chittagong port were normal. Long
distance buses and mechanized transports stayed off the roads, but
rickshaws plied all over the city as usual.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hartal call, all inter-city trains ran as usual
while three scheduled domestic flights and an international one
operated normally with usual load.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 2.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The productivity in the U.S. non-
farm sector rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first
quarter of this year, much slower than the 6.9 percent increase in
the previous quarter, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is the key
factor that determines how fast Americans' living standards can
rise. Higher productivity means that employers can afford to pay
their workers more without triggering inflation pressures
</P>
<P>
Economists had been expecting productivity growth to slow in
the first quarter, but the 2.4 percent rate was worse than the 3.5
percent they had been expecting. It was the slowest quarterly
performance since a 0.5 percent rate of increase in the second
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in productivity was accompanied by an acceleration
in unit labor costs, which rose at a rate of 1.8 percent in the
first quarter after having fallen at a 2.9 percent rate in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the unit labor costs remained at an exceptionally low level.
Compared to the first quarter of 1999, unit labor costs have risen
by just 0.7 percent, an even better performance than the mild 1.6
percent increase for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
While economists contend that inflation is unlikely to get out
of hand as long as unit labor costs continue increasing at such a
slow pace, they are also expecting the Federal Reserve to continue
raising interest rates to make sure that inflation does not
accelerate.
</P>
<P>
Productivity growth has doubled in the past four years compared
to the previous two decades, a gain that most economists
attributed to heavy investment by businesses in computers and
other productivity-enhancing equipment.

<HEADLINE> Double Fortified Salt Overcomes A Long-Term Nutritional Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problem is how to fortify salt with both iron and iodine
without compromising the effect of either nutrient.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, developed by the Micronutrient Initiative
and the University of Toronto, permits for the first time the
inexpensive addition of iron, along with already commonly added
iodine, to ordinary table salt, one of the only dietary staples
common to every region of the world.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is expected to help overcome Iron Deficiency
Anemia (IDA) as well as iodine deficiency, all with one simple
technology.
</P>
<P>
IDA is an extreme form of iron deficiency and the world's most
prevalent nutritional deficiency. Nearly two billion people,
mostly women, but also more than 50 percent of children under five
years in poor countries, are estimated to suffer from IDA. More
than one billion others are affected by less dramatic levels of
iron deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The toll taken by IDA is considerable. It reduces both physical
and mental capacities of whole populations. Even mild anemia may
affect the intellectual development of the very young.
</P>
<P>
Many people in developing countries have low iron levels
because their diets have low iron content or prevent adequate
absorption of the essential nutrient.
</P>
<P>
In early attempts to double fortify salt, a major obstacle was
chemical reactions caused by the combination of these nutrients.
Some attempts failed because the nutrient levels did not remain
constant over time. Other attempts resulted in salt with unusual
colors, flavors or textures that were not acceptable to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The iron in the new salt is combined with iodine encapsulated
with dextrin, using a process similar to the one used in coating
cold tablets. The coating prevents the iodine and iron from
interacting with one another or coming into contact with moisture
in the salt. Water-resistant packaging is critical to ensure the
stability of the nutrients.
</P>
<P>
Tests completed last year in Ghana and India showed that the
new salt has a long shelf life, high consumer acceptability,
provides sufficient iodine and iron absorption within the body and
has the ability to be produced inexpensively in most developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
And the cost would be considerably less than that already being
used to finance supplement-based iron programs in these regions.
</P>
<P>
The Micronutrient Initiative will provide the new double-
fortification technology to salt producers at no cost. The group
will also assist in transferring the technology to countries and
manufacturers to get the process initiated.
</P>
<P>
However, iron-fortified salt is not a complete solution to the
problem. Infants and children less than two years old have a low
salt intake. To meet their iron needs, their diets should also
include iron-rich foods.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Holding Oil-Sector Related Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday accused the
United States of placing various obstacles in the way of oil-
sector related applications and urged it to abandon its policy of
hostility.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations, Iraq's Minister for Foreign
Affairs Mohammed Said al-Sahaf said that since the adoption on 31
March 2000 of U.N. Resolution 1293, the oil sector has not
experienced any change.
</P>
<P>
Under Resolution 1293, Iraq is allowed to withdraw 600 million
U.S. dollars in every six months to import oil spare parts and
equipment to upgrade its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said that before the adoption of the resolution, the
total number of oil-sector related applications had been 564, for
a value of approximately 309 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
After its adoption, the total number of such applications was
565 as of 20 April 2000, for a value of approximately 316 million
dollars, Sahaf noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the number of applications placed on hold in the
period following the adoption of the resolution stood at 29 as of
20 April 2000, for a value of over 14 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said it is apparent that the hostile
approach to Iraq taken by the United States in the United Nations
sanctions committee has not changed and it intends to keep the
situation of Iraq's oil sector as it is.
</P>
<P>
"The result of keeping the oil sector in its present situation
will inevitably be that in the future Iraq will be unable to earn
the revenues required to purchase the humanitarian needs specified
in the Memorandum of Understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, unless the spare parts and equipment needed by the
petroleum industry reach Iraq, the result must be further
deterioration of the equipment now in use, and that in turn may
lead to environmental catastrophes within the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The United Nations Security Council adopted a
resolution in 1998 which allowed Iraq to use 300 million dollars
of its oil revenues in every six months to import oil spare parts
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq is clarified that it
has destroyed all the weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Head to Quit After Years of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Canada Governor Gordon
Thiessen announced his plan Thursday to retire next year after
presiding over the longest economic expansion in the country for
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old central bank head takes credit for the country'
s low inflation, which has been contained between 1 percent and 3
percent. He is also held responsible for a weak Canadian dollar,
which stood at 1.49 against one U.S. dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thiessen already informed the Bank's Board of Directors
Wednesday that he will retire at the end of his seven-year term on
January 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Before being appointed governor on January 31, 1994, Thiessen
had served as senior deputy governor since 1987. He is the sixth
governor of the central bank, which began operations in 1935 in
the middle of the Great Depression.

JAKARTA -- Indonesia's economy will grow by 5 percent this year
due to its exports increase and the recovery of the agriculture
sector, senior economist of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

</P>
<P>
"Many indicators show an improvement, such as a lower inflation
rate," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that despite indications that it is on its way to
recovery, Indonesia's economy remains fragile due to the weakness
in some important aspects.

<P>
One of the weaknesses is the tendency to increase of
consumption and export without being balanced by investment
activities. (Indonesia-ADB)

HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong registered an increase
of 21.6 percent in its volume of total exports in February over a
year earlier, figures released by the Census and Statistics
Department on Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that in February, the volume of Hong Kong's
re-exports increased by 22.5 percent over a year earlier, and that
of domestic exports increased by 15.8 percent. The volume of
imports increasing by 28.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the first two months of 2000 with the same period a
year earlier, the volume of Hong Kong's re-exports increased by 18.
5 percent, and that of domestic exports increased by 12.4 percent.
Taken together, the volume of total exports increased by 17.7
percent. Concurrently, imports increased by 22.1 percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
The change in volume of trade is derived from the change in
trade value with the effect of price changes discounted.
</P>
<P>
Comparing February 2000 with the same month of last year, the
prices of re-exports recorded virtually no change, while the
prices of domestic exports fell by 1.6 percent. On the other hand,
import prices increased by 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Marks May 4th Movement Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 young people gathered
Thursday in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center to mark
the 81st anniversary of the patriotic May 4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the event, Jiang Enzhu, director of the Liaison
Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said the patriotic spirit of the May
4th Movement will last for good though great changes have taken
place in the 81 years.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the May 4th Movement lies in patriotism, Jiang
said, and the return of Hong Kong under the "one country, two
systems" principle and washing away the national humiliation
reflects a victory of patriotic spirit of the movement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that commemorating the May 4th Movement is to
uphold the banner of patriotism, carry out the Hong Kong SAR Basic
Law to the letter, and create a brighter future for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR, said the
May 4th spirit has always been inspiring Chinese young people to
strive for building a rich and strong country, but the national
rejuvenation takes successive efforts of several generations.
</P>
<P>
He hopes the Hong Kong young people will make progress and
contribute to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The event is part of a series of programs organized by the Hong
Kong SAR Home Affairs Department, the Hong Kong United Youth
Association and the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups. Other
activities such as the photo exhibition and seminar will also be
held and will last to the end of May.

<HEADLINE> HK Extends Lead in World's Property Market: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is further extending its
lead as the world's most valuable residential property market,
according to a newly-published survey of world property prices and
trends of recent transactions.
</P>
<P>
Frank Marriott, managing director of FPDSavills Realty Limited,
said Hong Kong's consistent high ranking in the world's top
property markets in recent years, together with the extremely high
price levels of recent transactions since the report was complied,
show that Hong Kong property has maintained its status and is
still enormously valuable in global terms.
</P>
<P>
FPDSavills supplies information on the Hong Kong property
market for the Corcoran reports.
</P>
<P>
"The data collected in February for the report showed Hong Kong
as occupying the second position in the world after Tokyo in terms
of price of typical luxury apartments of up to 1,600 square feet,"
Marriott said at a press conference here to detail the latest
international report from the leading U.S. company Corcoran.com
Global Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has moved up the table from the fifth place in 1998
to third place in 1999 and the second place at the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the rapid appreciation in price that has
taken place at the top end in Hong Kong, even in a much slower
market with record low volumes of transactions and after the
recent property turmoil when prices dropped by up to 50 percent,"
Marriott said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the example quoted for Hong Kong in the apartment in
the report - an estimated 1,220 U.S. dollars per square foot for a
two-bedroom apartment in Barker Road in Hong Kong Island, was
greatly exceeded just a few days after we forwarded the Hong Kong
data to Corcoran," the managing director said. The sale was
announced for 1,298 U.S. dollars per square foot.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate the tremendous resilience of the Hong
Kong luxury sector, Marriott said, adding that Hong Kong's year-on-
year inclusion near the top of the list indicates that luxury
property possesses strong, consistent, underlying value.

<HEADLINE> Another Batch of Iraqi POWs Released by Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of 480 Iraqi Prisoners
of War (POWs), released by the Iranian authorities on Thursday,
have arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At 13:15 local time (0915 GMT), the POWs crossed the Iran-Iraq
border and set foot on Iraqi soil.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, many tearful POWs kelt down on the ground and
kissed the soil. It was an exciting and tearful reunion with the
loved ones of the POWs, with some having not been able to see their
parents, sons or daughters for as many as 18 years.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth batch of Iraqi POWs that Iran has released
recently. Nearly 2,000 Iraqi POWs held in Iran have been
repatriated and returned home.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expressed hope that the unilateral move will help solve
the POWs issue, one of the major hurdles on the way of
normalization of Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors fought a bloody war in 1980-88, in which some
1 million people from both sides lost their lives. Since 1991, they
have swapped some 90,000 POWs as part of the effort to normalize
their relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first session of the European
Commission and Cambodia Joint Commission ended Thursday in Phnom
Penh after two-day discussion on trade, political and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was co-chaired by Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Namhong and Director for Asia of the European Commission (EC)
Emiliano Fossati, in the presence of the Presidency of the
European Union (EU), EU member states and representatives of the
Royal Cambodian Government.
</P>
<P>
According to a Joint Press Release, the two sides acknowledged
the importance of strong and durable cooperation ties in order to
facilitate the achievement of the major development objectives of
the Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
The two parties identified the priority areas for future EC
development cooperation with Cambodia: rural support, human
resources development, primary education, humanitarian actions,
mine clearance, support to the reform of the public administration
and etc.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, both sides emphasized the importance of
participation by women in national development.

new initiatives to be launched soon in order to provide a
comprehensive framework of investment opportunities.

duty-free and quota-free market access concessions granted to
Cambodian textile exports. These concessions are provided for in
the context of the EC-Cambodia Trade in Textiles Agreement signed
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And the EC's aid to Cambodia has also increased rapidly. Since
1992, it has totaled more than 250 million euros.
</P>
<P>
Besides reiterating its support for the early admission of
Cambodia to the WTO, the EC informed Cambodia that it had received
an authorization from the EU Council of Ministers to negotiate
Cambodia's accession to the 1980 EC-ASEAN Agreement which it said
would further reinforce relations between the two parties.
</P>

Cambodia and the EC agreed that the next Joint Commission
session would be held in 2002 in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Passes Budget Amid Opposition Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his reply to the parliamentary discussion on the finance
bill 2000, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha rejected the demand of
the opposition parties for a rollback of the recent price hikes
for food and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition has argued that the price hikes seriously harmed
the interests of the poor and farmers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Sinha also blamed media for creating a "hype" on the price hike
issue and quipped: "How long we will keep flogging the issue?"
</P>
<P>
However, the finance minister told the parliament that the
central government has asked its Expenditure Commission to give a
review report in three months to ensure maximum benefit of food
and fertilizer subsidy to farmers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the Commission to give a quick report on
subsidies to better target it to food and fertilizers," he said. "
It will suggest ways on how subsidy reaches the deserving."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Denies Death of 2 Foreign Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military said Thursday
that reports of the supposed death of two of the 21 hostages
abducted by the Abu Sayyaf from Malaysia are "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado insisted that the military has not conducted any operation
" against the Abu Sayyaf, besides cordoning off the coastal areas
of Sulu to keep the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
In response to an earlier claim of the Abu Sayyaf leaders that
two foreigners have died, Mercado said Sulu governor Abdusakur Tan
and the military operative refuted the story.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military chief confirmed that the 21 hostages
have been separated into five groups by the Muslim rebel group in
an attempt to elude military troops.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also said the hostages are still within the vicinity of
Bandang village in Talipao town in Sulu province and are being
guarded by 150 Abu Sayyaf members.
</P>
<P>
According to Mercado, the rebels did attempt to break through
the military cordon but they retreated when they were fired at.
But he stressed there is no truth to reports of a military rescue
operation for the hostages.

JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed and
eight others heavily injured when an earthquake measuring 6.5 on
the Richter scale hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island and neighboring
islets on Thursday.

Antara news agency reported.

<P>
The epicenter was at a depth of 33 kilometers some 95
kilometers southeast of Luwuk, the main town of the district on
mainland Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
The report said 95 percent of buildings on Banggai island --
home to a few thousand people -- have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Economic Growth Expected to Exceed Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Improved economic performance is
leading Romania's economic growth to likely outpace the earlier
official forecast of 1.3 percent this year to reach 3 percent, the
daily Jurnanul National reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The re-estimate came in the wake of the economic pickup in the
eastern European country, where the first signs of recovery were
recorded in March, it said.
</P>
<P>
Romania's trade balance slightly improved in March and foreign
currency reserves consolidated enough to allow it to service its
foreign debt due this year, the report said, attributing these to
policies adopted by Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu's government to
boost export and investment.
</P>
<P>
It quoted government advisor Adrian Vasilescu as saying that
the country's exports have so far maintained a rapid growth and
are expected to exceed the forecast 8.7 billion U.S. dollars to
reach about 10 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"If things go on well, exports will reach even 11 billion
dollars," Vasilescu said, adding that the hope for the country's
industrial recovery is pinned on a boost in exports, which will
also help lift people's living standards.

<HEADLINE> Romania Tries to Extend Stand-by Agreement With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Emanuel Zervoudakis, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s chief negotiator with Romania,
left here Thursday for Washington with a letter of intent which
the Romanian government presented him for the extension of the
stand-by loan agreement after a week-long visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
For one week, Zervoudakis has carried out a series of talks and
negotiations with the Romanian authorities on the stand-by
agreement, which includes a credit of 547 million U.S. dollars
from the IMF to Romania.
</P>
<P>
The current agreement will be terminated on May 31 this year.
The Romanian government wishes to obtain an extension of the
agreement by at least 11 months.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Central Executive Bureau met Wednesday night to
debate and adopt the final form of the letter, which is expected
to convince the IMF board of the need to extend the agreement
during the May 15-20 session in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian authorities have expressed their optimism so far
in connection with the chances of extending the agreement, taking
into account the fact that the government has succeeded in the
implementation of 20 of the 25 conditions recommended by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The five domains in which the government is expected to make
efforts include the arrears of the big state-run enterprises which
had adversely affected financial performance, the salaries of the
budgetary employees, the rescheduling of the economic operators
debts and the facilities for investors.
</P>
<P>
Romania has received only the first tranche of 73 million U.S.
dollars of the 547 million dollars of credit granted by the stand-
by agreement, approved in August 1999 by the IMF board.
</P>
<P>
Four loan agreements were concluded after 1990 between Romania
and the monetary body but none was effectively enforced because
the Romanian party fell short of observing its initial commitments.
</P>
<P>
If Romania gets the approval of the IMF board, the agreement
could be extended by March 2001.

<HEADLINE> China Fulfills Obligations Under U.N. Convention Against Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government attaches great
importance to the implementation of the United Nations Convention
Against Torture and has fulfilled its relevant obligations, a top
Chinese official told the U.N. Committee Against Torture here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has taken very seriously the opinions
and recommendations made by the Committee during its consideration
of our previous reports," Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai told the
meeting of the Committee for consideration of China's third
periodic report on the implementation of the convention.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government submitted the third report to the U.N.
Secretary General last May.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese report is a good report indeed," said Cypriot
rapporteur Andreas Mavrommatis, commenting on Qiao's speech, "It
follows all the guidelines."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said that since it ratified the
convention in 1988 China has earnestly fulfilled all its
obligations and has made fresh efforts to improve its justice
system to achieve in full the goals of the convention.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the National People's Congress adopted the amendments
to the Chinese Constitution, which include a new provision that
China shall practice the principle of governing the country
according to law and build a socialist country ruled by law, Qiao
said.
</P>
<P>
"The addition of such a clause is of great significance to
effectively protecting citizens' rights," Qiao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, China amended its 1979 version of the
Criminal Procedure Law and Criminal Law respectively, reaffirming
principles such as "offenders shall be convicted and punished
according to law" and "no person shall be presumed guilty before
being judged by a People's Court according to law."
</P>
<P>
"All these amendments and additions offer an effective
guarantee for the prevention and sanction of acts of torture and
for the promotion of criminal justice," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop judicial officers from taking advantage of
their functions and powers, Qiao said, Chinese executive and
judicial organs have set up a series of regulations, rules and
mechanisms to prohibit extorting confessions by torture.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also told the committee that in order to instruct its
staff, the Chinese judicial departments have compiled manuals,
which include not only Chinese laws and regulations, but also
relevant international ones such as the Convention Against Torture,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Standard Minimum
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Code of Conduct for Law
Enforcement Officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government has vigorously strengthened "
Get to Know the Law" campaign among citizens with a view to
raising their awareness of the legal system and the rule of law,
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 193 suspects were convicted in China of extorting
confessions by torture, extracting testimony by violence or
physically abusing persons held in custody. In 1999 the number of
such convicts dropped to 173, Qiao added.

<HEADLINE> Euro Fall Not Reflecting Economic Performance: EU Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that the value of the single currency euro was not
reflected by its plunges to one record low after another.
</P>
<P>
"The value of the euro does not reflect the economic
performance or the sound economic fundamentals," said one
spokesman for the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The euro will eventually recover to display its true value and
the sound economic fundamentals," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The commission official made the comment after the single
currency bottomed out at another new record low against the U.S.
dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In early morning trading, the euro hit an exchange rate of 0.
8845 dollar before climbing to 0.8923 dollar. On Wednesday, the
single currency plunged through the 0.90-dollar mark for the first
time since its inauguration on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts blamed the fall of the euro on the strong U.
S. economy that has attracted the money away from Europe where
investors would otherwise have put their money into European
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
The outflow of cash strengthened the dollar but weakened the
euro.
</P>
<P>
The governments of EU member states and officials of the
European Central Bank remained calm, insisting that the economic
performance of the union and the euro zone has been good and the
economic growth would turn the tables around.
</P>
<P>
Rumors, however, spread out that the Frankfurt-based European
Central Bank would soon intervene by buying the beleaguered single
currency and the rumors pushed some traders to buy euros already.

<HEADLINE> EU Not Seeking Austria Exit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A European Commission official said
on Thursday that the European Union was not seeking an exit
strategy against Austria.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Faull, deputy chief spokesman for the 20-member EU
executive body, said that the commission would like to facilitate
any dialogue between Austria and its EU partners who have joined
hands in politically boycotting the incorporation of the far-right
Freedom Party in its government.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has asked the commission to act as a mediator," said
the spokesman who has been hosting most of the recent mid-day
press briefings given by the commission. On Wednesday, Commission
President Romano Prodi dismissed chief spokesman Ricardo Levi for
enhancing working efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Since the Freedom Party joined the ruling coalition with the
conservative People's Party of Federal Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel on February 4 this year, the other 14 EU member states
have frozen bilateral political ties with Austria.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, has taken a "business as usual"
approach toward Austria in work on European level but said it
would watch closely what Austria does.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Joerg Haider officially stepped down as leader of
Austria's Freedom Party as announced in February in order to help
the Austrian government function smoothly. However, European
leaders have recently made it clear that the chance is little for
their states to change stance.

<HEADLINE> Montreal Police Officer Shot in Gunfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A Montreal police officer was shot
and taken to hospital with a wounded hip late Wednesday while
trying to stop a stolen car on an east-end Montreal street.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested after the gunfight, during which,
one suspect was also shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
The five-year veteran of the Montreal Urban Community police
force is listed in serious but stable condition. It is apparently
the most serious shooting injury sustained by a Montreal officer
since 1996, police said.
</P>
<P>
According to Police spokesman Andre Durocher, the officer saw a
white male attempting to enter a gray Chrysler Dynasty at the
corner of Adam St. at about 4:30 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
"That vehicle had been reported stolen and it had been involved
in several armed robberies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The officer and a fellow police officer went over to talk to
the suspect, who ran away with the officers in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
A gunfire broke out in front of an elementary school, where
some pupils witnessed the wounded police officer slumping to the
pavement on Morgan Ave. The police returned fire, wounding one
suspect in the leg.

<HEADLINE> Spring Holiday Ignites China's Tourism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's first week-long spring
holiday, kicked off by May 1, International Labor Day, has ignited
the country's tourism industry with millions of travelers flocking
to time-honored scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, tens of thousands of tourists have arrived daily
since Monday. The per-day tourism revenue in southwestern Yunnan
Province has exceeded 100 million yuan, and the number of visitors
to the Lijiang River in Guilin over the past three days has beat
the city record.
</P>
<P>
Railways stations and airports in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Guangzhou and other major tourism cities have been swamped with
tourists coming and going.
</P>
<P>
The tourism wave is a direct result of the seven-day holiday
and this week's ideal weather, said Wen Xiao'an, director of the
Planning and Finance Department of the China National tourism
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wen pointed out that other important factors have contributed
to the phenomenon. China's economy has recorded unprecedented high
growth since the policies of reform and opening up were introduced
some two decades ago, accompanied by the steady growth of people's
income. When people have basically all their material needs --
food, clothing and shelter -- they can think about luxuries like
travel, he added.

By the end of 1999, the average income for China's urban
residents had jumped to 5,854 yuan over 1978's sum of 343 yuan;
and rural residents' average income had multiplied from the yearly
134 yuan yearly to 2,210 yuan, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
For years, ordinary Chinese viewed travel as a pleasure
reserved for the rich. Before 1978, their purchases were limited
mostly to durable products such as bicycles, sewing machines,
watches and radio sets. In the 1980s, they advanced to color TVs,
refrigerators, washing machines and videocassette recorders, and
later to telephones and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Spending money on tourism has become popular in China only
recently, and is a mindset that stems from the booming economy and
growth in personal income, said Zhang Qizi with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
As China continues to open wider to the outside world and the
pace of life speeds up, Chinese people's views about spending will
also broaden, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that smaller families and the improved social security
system have led Chinese to spend more and deposit less.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yue, a tourist from Hefei city of Anhui Province, said: "I
have been to Beijing several times, but always on business trips.
This time, I brought my wife and son along, so he can learn from
the rich historic and cultural relics here."

<TEXT>
<P>
China's travel industry got its big break with the country's
reform policies, and the Chinese government realizes the
importance of stimulating domestic demand for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central government added three public holidays
to the official calendar, bringing the total number of days off,
including weekends, to 114, and forming four lengthy periods for
travel revolving around holidays: Spring Festival, International
Labor Day, Summer Vacation and National Day.
</P>
<P>
The country's domestic tourism market has benefited enormously
from the move. Statistics from the National Tourism Administration
indicate that last year's total number of domestic tourists
exceeded 700 million, with tourism revenues from the sector
soaring 18 percent to 283.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To meet the surging demand of the tourism market, China has
mapped out a plan to turn the country into a major world tourism
destination within 20 years. According to the scheme, China's
total tourism revenue is expected to hit 3.3 trillion yuan by 2020,
accounting for 8 percent of the country's gross domestic product,
and nearly double the current figure.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that this is feasible, as it basically meets the
expected growth rate of the country's economy and residents'
income. It's also in keeping with people's desire to improve their
quality of life with leisure activities such as travel.

HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Forty persons were found positive
in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) antibody tests in Hong Kong
in the first quarter of 2000, bringing the cumulative total number
of reported HIV infections to 1,399, the Department of Health
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two new AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) cases
were also reported in the same quarter. This brings to a total of
455 confirmed AIDS cases reported since 1985.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 40 HIV new cases reported, 30 acquired the infection
via heterosexual contacts and four via homosexual or bisexual
contacts. One other case involved an injecting drug user," said
Wong Ka-hing, consultant of the department's special preventive
program, adding that the transmission routes for the remaining
five were undetermined due to inadequate data.
</P>
<P>
The 40 HIV infection cases involved 32 males and eight females,
representing a ratio of 4 to 1.
</P>
<P>
For the cumulative total of 1,399 HIV infections, 82 percent
acquired the infection through sexual contacts, including two
thirds through heterosexual transmission. Twenty-four cases
occurred among injecting drug users. Ten babies were infected
through mother-to-infant transmission.
</P>
<P>
The 22 new AIDS cases involved 21 males and one female. Eighty-
two percent got the infection through heterosexual contacts,
according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
The department monitors the HIV/AIDS situation through a
voluntary reporting system. The first cases of the HIV and AIDS
were reported in Hong Kong in 1984 and 1985, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains World's Busiest Container Port  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong regains its title as the
world's busiest container port with the total throughput reaching
more than 16.2 million TEUs in 1999, a senior port official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board (PMB) Peter
Thompson said the port of Hong Kong recorded a 11.2 percent
increase in container throughput in 1999, bringing it back to the
number one position as the world's busiest container port.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter of this year has registered continued growth
in the container throughput in Kwai Chung of 16.2 percent compared
with the same period of last year," Thompson said when delivering
his annual report.
</P>
<P>
Thompson attributed the growth of the container throughput of
the port of Hong Kong partly to the acceleration of the Asian
recovery and an upturn in transpacific shipments in the second
half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the government and the private sector, working
together through the board, have taken measures to enhance the
competitiveness of Hong Kong's container port," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our next major development is the construction of Container
Terminal 9 which is expected to be completed by 2004. Occupying an
area of 70 hectares, it has six berths with a design capacity to
handle at least 2.6 million TEUs a year."
</P>
<P>
In the years ahead, the board will continue to take effective
measures to enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a leading
port in Asia and an international maritime center in the world.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening Hong Kong's competitiveness as a logistics
center, Thompson said that his board is committed to providing a
conducive environment and the necessary infrastructure for the
development of logistics business and supply chain management.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong was awarded the Best Seaport in Asia in
1999 at the 13th Asian Freight Industry Awards organized by the
freight industry publication, Cargonews Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of PMB's Shipping Committee Frank Tsao also said the
package of measures introduced in April 1999 to make the Hong Kong
Shipping Register more competitive and user-friendly had borne
impressive results.

<HEADLINE> Tung Urges Non-Profits to Find New Ways to Appeal Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said Thursday that non-
profit-making organizations should explore new and innovative ways
to appeal the community.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks when attending an opening ceremony of the
United Way International World Assembly 2000 at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
The theme, "Building Community Through Social Responsibility,"
provides a precious opportunity to share experiences and
information and to explore ideas in enhancing fund-raising
initiatives as you work towards the common goal of a cohesive and
a caring society worldwide, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to look far to see the ever increasing need for
funds for a whole range of community-related social and welfare
projects or for disaster relief programs in different parts of the
world," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
No doubt these competing demands can make it just that little
bit harder for charitable organizations to find the resources they
require to fund their various programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to say that over the years, the Hong Kong
government has established an effective and strong partnership
with the welfare sector and the community, in working towards the
goals of providing well-targeted, quality and cost-effective
welfare services and building a just and caring community," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that non-profit-making organizations capable of
mobilizing communities around the world to care for the needy are,
therefore, an essential part of our lives in the 21st century, as
they have been in the century just ended.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Hong Kong Community Chest, being an
affiliate organization, has contributed to these efforts since
1968 and successfully raised significant funds for welfare
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Last financial year, the figure was over 210 million HK dollars
(about 27 million U.S. dollars) notwithstanding the Asian
financial turmoil. Today, some 800,000 people benefit through its
140 social welfare agencies.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Panel Recommends to Levy Tax on Capital Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli treasury committee
Thursday unveiled its recommendations for sweeping tax reform,
under which heavy tax will be levied on real profits from trading
on capital markets, the first time of its kind in Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
The tax rate on profits made from stock trading, short- and
medium-term interest-bearing savings plans, provident funds,
pension funds, and continued-education funds will be 25 percent,
according to the report prepared by a panel led by Finance Ministry
Director-General Avi Ben-Bassat.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new taxation item is aimed to offset the
state's loss of tax revenue due to income tax reform, in which the
take-home pay of middle-class wage earners will be increased by
about NIS 1,000 (about 250 U.S. dollars) each, Ben-Bassat said at a
nationally televised news conference on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also reintroduce the inheritance tax, and the
starting point of such taxation will be more than 1 million U.S.
dollars for a couple.
</P>
<P>
The Ben-Bassat committee consists of five economic professors,
three present and past treasury officials, an insurance business
representative, an accountant and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
It was established eight months ago to accomplish Barak's
election pledges to correct "historic income tax distortions" and
to reduce the social gaps between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The report has aroused so great interests from the public that
the website of the Finance Ministry, which posted the details of
the reform masterplan, had been crashed on Thursday morning due to
overload, with morn than 50,000 visitors registered at less than
two hours.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform will not be implemented immediately, with the
most possible effective date being January 1, 2001, because it
should get approval from the Knesset (Parliament) at first.
</P>
<P>
However, it appeared that the road to the Knesset will not be
smooth as many political groups have shouted their displeasure with
the plan, or at least parts of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Women Knesset members form all parliamentary factions have
rallied together to fight the proposed abolition of the half-point
tax exemption for working women.
</P>
<P>
Silvan Shalom, MK from the opposition Likud Party, termed the
proposal as "a bluff", which he argued not only could not support
the low-income families, but also made their lives worse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secular Shinui party is opposing the capital tax,
as the party worries foreign investors will take their capitals out
of the country and affect the economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Yisrael Ba'aliya and the National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu
party frowned on the tax on apartment rentals, as the taxation
would harm the interests of immigrants and young couples, the major
force in the rental market and the two parties' constituents.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut, or Jewish Labor Federation, is publicly against
the tax on continued-education funds, arguing that it will harm the
chance for average workers to upgrade his skills.
</P>
<P>
The union has announced plans to hold a countrywide one-hour
strike on Sunday over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists, in contrast, are "supporting" the reform,
only except the abolition of tax relief for night-shift workers,
which will mean they have to pay more to these workers to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv stock markets reacted with equanimity to the
concerns of the reform proposal on capital tax, though, the
activity on the stock exchange are lower than usual.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's bank system was reportedly flooded with
customers trying to move their deposits to long-term savings in
order to avoid the new levies.
</P>
<P>
All the hubbub was regarded by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
as normal phenomenon." Like any legislation, there is always a
degree of doubt as to whether it will pass," Barak said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent speculators from taking advantage of the transition
period between the old and the new tax systems, Finance Minister
Avraham Shochat is expected to sign interim orders to legalize the
reform before the Knesset approval.
</P>
<P>
However, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein had told Shochat
that the orders should only come into effect after being approved
at least by the Knesset's Finance Committee, which will not meet
before next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Elie Goldschmidt, Chairman of the committee, had warned on
Wednesday that his panel will not be a mere rubber stamp.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Defends Image Against Unfair Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on Thursday
challenged the British Insurance Firm's report which ranked the
nation as the fifth "riskest" country in the world in terms of
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Press Assistant Secretary
Mike Toledo said the result of the survey conducted by the Hiscox
Group "may not actually reflect the real situation in the
Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Toledo said the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the
Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force have already
neutralized major kidnap-for-ransom gangs in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent abduction incidents in Mindanao are
isolated cases and do not reflect the general peace and order
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Toledo, the latest statistics released by the PNP
showed that the heinous crime volume in the first quarter of 2000
dropped by 30.85 percent to 3,328 cases from 4,812 for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
On kidnapping cases, the official said, statistics from the PNP
showed that for the first quarter of this year, six cases were
filed while one is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Toledo said, there were also six cases filed and six
were in "under investigation" category for the same period.
However, he added, the Hiscox Group report said there were 39
abductions in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Joseph Estrada reportedly urged rebel
groups to stop their act of terrorism and to join him to uplift
the lives of the people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday at the inauguration of an industrial park in
La Union province of the northern Philippines, Estrada said that
while he wants unity, he will not tolerate any violation of the
Constitution,which says there is only one government in the
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Free U.N. Peacekeepers Underway in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to free the 49 United Nations
peacekeeping forces from the hands of former rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone are still continuing despite
that the rebel leader Foday Sankoh denied the hostage-taking by
his men.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Freetown on Thursday,
the U.N.  peacekeeping troops have entered the second day since
they sealed off Sankoh's home in the capital of the country on
Wednesday after seven of their colleagues from Kenya were killed.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that U.N. peacekeepers have been killed
in Sierra Leone since they were deployed in the west African
country in April to enforce a peace deal signed by the warring
parties in mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Although Sankoh has reportedly denied that the U.N. hostages
are in his men's hands, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
has been in touch with regional heads of state who are sending
envoys to negotiate with the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published during his stay in Paris on Wednesday,
Annan expressed his outrage at the incident, saying Sankoh is to
blame for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that those being held hostages would be
freed "in very little time from now."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a regional power in west Africa, sent a five-man team
on Wednesday to Sierra Leone to negotiate the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report, four Russian members of a
helicopter crew and a British military observer are also among
those being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Eldred Collins, spokesman for the RUF's political wing, the
Revolutionary United Front Party, Wednesday accused the United
Nations of trying to "derail the hard-won peace Sierra Leoneans
have been praying for."
</P>
<P>
He said the RUF fighters were provoked by U.N. soldiers who
wanted them to surrender their weapons by force.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the RUF "is trying its level best to put
things under control as it is totally committed to the Lome Peace
Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations on its side accused RUF fighters of
 attacking the peacekeepers' positions in the central towns of
Makeni and Magburaka earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The clashes coincided with the final withdrawal of the
Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force from the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 15,000 RUF gunmen are still controlling the rebel
heartland, which stretches to the fabulously wealthy diamond areas
in the east of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Facing them is the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, which
comprises about 8, 000 troops in a force that is planned
eventually to number over 11, 000.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Seeks Compromise on Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Wednesday forwarded a letter to the National Assembly, the
country's top legislature, to seek approval for the implementation
of the noncontentious aspects of the year 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted the
 president as saying in the letter that "our position is that on
matters which both the executive and legislative agree, I will
execute."
</P>
<P>
The disagreed parts can be exempted from execution until
harmonization by the two sides is reached in terms of a subsequent
supplementary appropriation bill, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo submitted the budget bill last November, which was
approved by the National Assembly only last month with significant
spending increase.
</P>
<P>
The president refused to sign the amended bill because, as some
critics have pointed out, the increased spending will go to the
benefit of the West African country's top legislature in one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged conflict over the budget has worsened ties
between the two branches of government and taken toll on the much
needed economic growth in the impoverished country.

<HEADLINE> Angola Approves Sino-Angolan Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the Angolan
Council of Ministers has approved the memorandum of understanding
on its cooperation with China in telecommunication, official
newspaper Jornal de Angola reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report came after a meeting presided by Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos, which issued a communique saying that the
approved document is aimed to strengthen the exchange of strategic
development policies and cooperation in telecommunication and
computing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum "encourages the relations of cooperation among
companies from both countries, promoting trade of
telecommunication equipments and also creating conditions for the
setting up of a manufacturing industry in Angola, through the
transfer of know-how and training on computers and
telecommunication fields," the report said.
</P>
<P>
With vast territory and a lot of potential customers, Angola,
which lacks the technology for establishing and developing the
telecommunication network, is considered by experts as a good
market for this business.

<HEADLINE> Court Relives Horror as Lockerbie Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Witnesses from
Lockerbie were called on Thursday to describe what happened more
than 11 years ago when a jumbo jet was bombed out of the sky and
fell upon their town, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The second day of the long-awaited trial of the terrorist
bombing was dominated by an exhaustive re-creation of what had
happened by eye-witnesses who described the scene of horror
immediately after the crash of the Pan Am Flight 103 airliner from
10,000 meters above.
</P>
<P>
Plane wreckage, luggage and bodies, some still strapped to
their seats, were strewn over a wide area and a street was wiped
out by the crashing plane from the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
An eye-witness told the Scottish court on Dutch soil that he
saw an explosion overhead while he was driving on an empty road. "
There was the flash and then an orange glowing object that
continued in a gradually descending trajectory as it went through
the sky," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first hours of testimony on the opening day Wednesday were
focused on the flight of Pan Am Flight 103 from London Heathrow to
the point of its mid-aid destruction over Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
Six air traffic controllers were called to log out the
aircraft's route, speed and position until the moment when the New
York-bound flight disappeared from radar screens, leaving only
some traces of what later turned out to be the bigger wreckage of
the airliner.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers on Wednesday blamed two Palestinian groups for
the bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103 airliner on December 21,1988.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans suspected in the bombing of the New York-bound
jumbo jet pleaded not guilty at the opening of the trial.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that other terrorist groups and individuals were
responsible for the mid-air bombing that killed 259 people on
board and another 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation immediately after the tragedy led to
the issuance in 1991 of an arrest warrant for Abdel Basset Ali al-
Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fahima.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, the United States and Britain accepted a Libyan
offer of a trial in the Netherlands under the Scots Law and the
two accused Libyans surrendered themselves to the Dutch police in
April the following year.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least one year and is
estimated to cost some 3 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, after interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting
200,000 pieces of evidence in the biggest murder investigation in
history, were convinced that they had had the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said that the court would hold sessions almost
daily through July 28 before adjourning until August 22.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Keen on Boosting Cooperation with Egypt: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Minister of Labor and
Social Affairs Ali Al-Namla said here on Thursday that his country
is keen on boosting cooperation with Egypt in various domains.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Egyptian Minister of Manpower and Employment
Ahmed el-Amawi, the Saudi minister said that strong and long-
standing relations between Riyadh and Cairo provide the basis for
cooperation, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Namla arrived here on Monday for talks on creating more
opportunities for trained Egyptian workers to work in Saudi Arabia
and prospects for enhancing cooperation in vocational training.

<P>
Egyptian laborers in Saudi Arabia "have full care" provided by
the kingdom and "enjoy their full rights as Saudi officials are
keen on protecting their interests," the Saudi official told el-
Amawi.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian expatriates "contribute effectively to Saudi
development programs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 950,000 Egyptians are working in Saudi Arabia, forming the

Arab countries, especially those in the Gulf area, absorb an
additional 1.7 million Egyptian workers.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian expatriate workers remit back to Egypt an annual 4
billion U.S. dollars, making it one of the country's largest hard
currency earners besides tourism, oil export and the Suez Canal.

sales of Turkish Tofas and Italian Fiat cars through loans to
motorists, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>

Speaking at a press conference in Istanbul Wednesday, Koc
Financing Group head Kutsan Celebican said that the initiative was
aimed at making Turkish consumers car owners through a most
convenient and highest quality financing service.
</P>
<P>

TEHRAN -- Iran's non-oil exports declined by 35.2 percent to 129
million U.S. dollars during the first month of the current Iranian
calender year, which started on March 20, local newspaper Jahan
Eqteshad (Economic World) reported on Thursday.
</P>

Quoting a report from the Iranian Customs, the daily said that
over 677,000 tons of non-oil items were exported during the period,
down by 39.5 percent in weight compared with the same period of
last Iranian year.
</P>

waiting for new trade policies, the stabilization of foreign
exchange rates, the usual economic stagnation following the
holidays as the main reasons behind the decline.
</P>
<P>
JEDDAH -- Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said on
Wednesday that Riyadh has received investment offers that worth
more than 100 billion U.S. dollars so far.
</P>

He estimated that Saudi Arabia will need a total investment of
200 billion dollars during the next 20 years to develop the sectors
of oil, gas, power, water desalination and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The public share-holding company Emmar for Properties
said it will open an integrated complex for manufacturing gold and
diamond in August, which will be the first of its kind in the

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Director Nina A. Soboliva has
filmed a documentary which touched upon the decade-long U.N.
sanctions against Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The film criticized the U.S. and British governments for
insisting on keeping the anti-Iraqi sanctions in place, stressing
that the sanctions and the regular bombardments by U.S. and British
warplanes have caused great damages to Iraq by killing innocent
people and destroying Iraq's economy, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and it has become an almost daily occurrence
for the U.S. and British planes to bomb the two no-fly zones, set
up after the 1991 Gulf War, in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his film, the Russian director tried to expose the pains and
diseases that the Iraqi people are subject to under the
unprecedented U.N. embargo, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the documentary showed the destructive impacts
inflicted on Yugoslavia's infrastructure by the U.S.-led Western
alliance air strikes against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth documentary Soboliva has produced on Iraq.
Among the other three films, the first and the third were about the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq, and the second on Iraq's long history of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The first, finished in 1997, revealed the sufferings of the
Iraqi people, especially children, under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Russian people got acquainted with the
miserable humanitarian situation in Iraq, said Soboliva, adding
that the film was even shown in the Russian lower house of
parliament, State Duma.
</P>
<P>
"The third film was about the Iraqi children under the yoke of
sanctions. The film moved the feelings of the Russian people toward
their friends in Iraq," Soboliva was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that over 1.2 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Soboliva, who paid her first visit to Iraq in 1997, is now on
her eighth visit to this country.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I visit Iraq, I can find many positive changes in
the lives of the Iraqi people," said Soboliva.

<HEADLINE> Israel Must Return Shebaa Farms to Lebanon: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese leaders told visiting U.N.
Middle East envoy Terje Roed Larsen that the violence in south
Lebanon will not cease if Israel does not relinquish the Shebaa
Farms in its planned troop withdrawal, the Daily Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss told reporters that "Lebanon wants to
liberate its occupied territories and restore its sovereignty
there. It will not give up one centimeter of the territories,
especially the Shebaa Farms."
</P>
<P>
The highly fertile farms, seized by Israel from Lebanon in the
1967 Middle East war, are located on the Lebanese side of Mount
Hermon, Syria's highest mountain, which is under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel argues that the Shebba Farms belong to Syria, and that a
withdrawal from the area will be considered in peace talks with
Damascus when they resume.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri also stressed the importance of
the area, saying that "the Shebaa Farms are indisputably Lebanese."
</P>
<P>
According to the British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms are not included in
the Lebanese side. But Beirut retorted that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in a 1951 agreement between Lebanon and its major power
broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Larsen told reporters upon his arrival here Wednesday that the
U.N. has no mandate on border matters in dispute between member
states. "Demarcating borders is a matter for the states," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Create E-Commerce Friendly Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANGMAI, Thailand, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is determined to create an e-
commerce-friendly environment to make the region better prepared
and better positioned to face the challenges of a knowledge-
intensive global economy, a senior ASEAN official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar co-organized by the Asian Development
Bank and International Business Machines Corporation, Chairman of
E-ASEAN Task Force Roberto Romulo said that in order to create an
e-commerce-friendly environment in the region, the member
countries have agreed on a series of regional standards based on
international norms.
</P>
<P>
These include electronic identification and authentication,
secure electronic payments and settlements, legal recognition of
electronic transactions and code of e-commerce practice.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2003 all the ASEAN countries should adopt at least
one e-commerce law, Romulo said, who is also former foreign
affairs secretary of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
For countries which already adopted e-commerce legal
infrastructure, Romulo said, ASEAN encourage them to promote
mutual recognition and cross certification of digital signature
and documents by 2001.
</P>
<P>
These countries should also facilitate secure regional
electronic payments and settlements at the latest by 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the region's backwardness in the e-economy era, the
ASEAN leaders also plan to establish an ASEAN information
infrastructure, the ASEAN official said.
</P>
<P>
The member countries should enhance inter-connectivity and
interoperability of national information infrastructures by 2001,
encourage cooperation in internet exchanges and gateways, regional
caching, mirroring and hubbing, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries will also work together to establish borderless
ASEAN marketplace for trade and investments in information and
communication technology goods and services, Romulo said.
</P>
<P>
Member countries should accelerate tariff reduction on goods
and framework agreement on services, he said, adding that they
should also promote investment in information and communication
technology sector and facilitate the implementation of fast track
mutual recognition agreement.
</P>
<P>
The E-ASEAN Task Force is a public-private sector advisory body,
set up in November 1999 to advise how to achieve an enabled and
connected ASEAN community.
</P>
<P>
Its major mandate is to develop comprehensive action plan for
ASEAN to plug into global e-space.

<HEADLINE> EC, ESA to Accelerate Satellite Navigation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission and the
European Space Agency (ESA) opened on Thursday a joint office to
accelerate the development of the Galileo Satellite Navigation
System.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based office will provide technical support to the
executive body of Europe's space program and to the industrial and
scientific teams working on the Galileo navigation system.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, European Union commissioner for energy and
transport, said that Galileo is one of the most important
technological innovations in the 15-nation bloc for the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
The office "creates the first permanent physical link between
the two main European institutions which are pressing ahead with
work on the new satellite-based navigation, positioning and
precision time-keeping system.
</P>
<P>
Less than a year ago, the EU decided to enter the race to
develop the next generation of satellite-based navigation and
precision time-keeping system with a European-developed, state-of-
the-art design that would set the industry standard for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Galileo is also expected to bring about benefits to other
aspects of life with precision farming and raising yields,
improved information for emergency services, speeding up response
time and more reliable and accurate timing signals underpinning
the most vital computer and communications networks.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the Galileo navigation program has been run by the
European Commission's directorate general for energy and transport
with the ESA as an equal partner in the management board.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Rodota, director general of the European Space Agency,
said that the opening of the joint office marked a step forward in
one of Europe's most promising new space programs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province to Stem Poppy Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
will send narcotics officers after poppy growers this month in
effort to halt the illegal production of opium.
</P>
<P>
A wide-scale search, organized by the Provincial Narcotics
Control Commission, will be carried out in farm fields, household
courtyards, orchards and woods throughout the province, and poppy
plants found will be confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Not only will poppy growers face lawful punishment, local
officials who do little or nothing to ban the growing of the plant
will also be prosecuted, said a commission official.
</P>
<P>
The National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) announced over
the weekend that 4,193 Chinese citizens nationwide were punished
according to law for growing opium poppies last year.
</P>
<P>
Opium, which is made from the poppy plant, has been used as a
narcotic for more than a century in China and used to be grown
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fengrui, deputy director of the Office of the NNCC,
acknowledged that although narcotics control officers have brought
the illicit growing of opium poppies under control, sporadic cases
still occur, especially in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Public Security, China had over
680,000 registered drug addicts by the end of 1999, 14.3 percent
more than in 1998. More than 490,000, or 72 percent of the total,
are addicted to heroin, which is made using opium as a raw
material.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah to Regain Strength: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Amid worry about further weakening
of the Indonesian currency of rupiah, an economic senior minister
said here Thursday that the rupiah will regain strength to the 6,
000 to 7,000 per U.S. dollars, as economic recovery process has
been in place.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Ministers' Meeting on Investment, Indonesian
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian
Gie said, "Inflation over the next few years is likely to remain
very low, as it has been in last year. With growing investors'
confidence and rising export, we could see a strengthening of the
rupiah to the 6,000-7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rupiah on Thursday morning season traded at 7,850 (buying) and
8,000 (selling) per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks the rupiah continued to decline to a lower
level than expected.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie also said that within two to three years
Indonesia could see a return to a pre-crisis economic growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hammering out to attract foreign investors
to come and invest here in its bid to make the on-going economic
recovery successful.
</P>
<P>
According to Kwik Kian Gie, there are solid signs of a recovery
in exports. But there are not yet any solid signs of recovery in
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic growth of Indonesia for the year 2000 as
a whole will exceed 4 percent. "Nonetheless, this is still a lower
rate of growth than other countries in the region and Indonesia
will require several more years of steady growth to attain the per
capita level of output reached just before the start of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Expected to Grow by 5 Percent This year: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy will grow by 5
percent this year due to its exports increase and the recovery of
the agriculture sector, senior economist of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) Sultan Haveez Rahman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many indicators show an improvement, such as a lower inflation
rate," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that despite indications that it is on its way to
recovery, Indonesia's economy remains fragile due to the weakness
in some important aspects.
</P>
<P>
One of the weaknesses is the tendency to increase of
consumption and export without being balanced by investment
activities.
</P>
<P>
He further underlined the importance of investment activities
here to boost the government-sponsored economic recovery process.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in export and consumption should be balanced by
an increase in investment," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said that although there is an emerging
economic recovery in recent months, the economic recovery is still
fragile.
</P>
<P>
"This fact has been driven home by the unexpected recent
weakening of the rupiah (Indonesian currency), which shows once
again that there is no room for complacency," Kwik Kian Gie said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules out Conditional Talks with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday once again ruled
out the possibility of talks with India with pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
"They have laid down pre-conditions but we will not hold talks
with any pre-conditions," Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has required Pakistan to halt supporting
anti-India activities in the disputed area of Kashmir before it
would consider resumption of bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Pakistan Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf '
s recent offer for talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee, Altaf said, "It shows our positive approach to the
dialogue at the highest level and our willingness to resolve the
outstanding disputes, particularly the core issue of Jammu and
Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, it also showed India's negative
attitude, "which needs to undergo changes as the international
community is desirous of resolution of disputes."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said India has launched a "Hate Pakistan"
campaign for quite some time. "There is no doubt that it is a war
of kind."
</P>
<P>
He said Indian charges that Pakistan's diplomatic missions in
Nepal and Bangladesh were being using for spying purposes were
part of this malicious anti-Pakistan campaign.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees Using Force for Captives Release Aggravating Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Thursday the use
of force to free captives could sometimes aggravate the situation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has always given priority to negotiations in efforts
to secure the release of the 21 people abducted by gunmen from
Sipadan Island off Sabah, East Malaysia, on April 23, Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday here after a function.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, also home minister, made the statement when asked if
Malaysia is agreeable to a military solution or prefers the
negotiation approach in trying to secure the release of the 10
Malaysians and 11 foreigners who are currently held in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia sent its Minister in the Prime Minister's Department
Pandikar Amin Mulia, as the prime minister's special envoy, and
Deputy Defense Minister Shafie Apdal to Manila on Tuesday to
monitor the efforts to free the captives.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Norian Mai is also in
the Philippines to deal with the matters pertaining to the
abduction.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia wants to cooperate with the Philippines
in securing the captives' release and does not wish to create
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Exports Fall 10 Percent: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's exports decreased by 10.2
percent from 635.1 million U.S. dollars to 570.4 million U.S.
dollars between 1998 and last year, said a report by the country's
Agribank.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin released here on Thursday, Agribank said
the decrease resulted from declining international market prices
of traditional exports such as cotton, sugar, cereals and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease occurred at a time when Zimbabwe is expected to
intensify its export drive as a sustainable solution to the
foreign currency crisis haunting the nation," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is now facing a foreign currency crisis, which has
resulted in a fuel shortage and a scaling down of industrial
operations, coupled with high interest rates and serious
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The country, and financial institutions in particular, should
contribute to widening the productive and export capacity by
identifying and nurturing the export potential of the small to
medium-scale enterprises, " said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Input costs for farmers are also rising at a faster rate than
producer prices because of inflation, the bank observed, warning
that this, together with the escalating cost of energy and water,
could harm the agriculture- based economy.
</P>
<P>
The diesel shortage also meant that farmers who relied on
mechanical harvesters would not be able to take their produce to
the market, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Seeks Compromise on Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has forwarded a letter to the National Assembly, the country's top
legislature, seeking approval for the implementation of only the
noncontentious aspects of the year 2000 budget, according to the
Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the president as
saying in the letter that "our position is that on matter which
both the executive and legislative agree, I will execute".
</P>
<P>
Those disagreed areas will be exempted from execution until
harmonization by the two sides was reached in the term of a
subsequent supplementary appropriation bill, said the president
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo submitted the budget bill last november, which was
approved by the National Assembly last month with significant
spending increase.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo refused to sign the amended bill, the increase of
which, according to some critics, will go to the benefit of the
West African country's top legislature in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged conflict over the budget has worsened ties
between the two branches of the government and taken toll of the
much needed economic growth in the impoverished country.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province Brings Marine Pollution under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Liaoning Province in
northeast China has greatly reduced the severe marine pollution in
the Bohai Sea due to intensified pollution reduction measures.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment in the Bohai Sea have reported
substantial improvement and polluted waters of all shades have
basically disappeared, according to Li Jianxin, deputy director of
the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pollution pressure in the Bohai Sea, the provincial
government has been investing 100 million yuan annually for
pollution reduction in the Liaohe River, and local regulations
have also been adopted in that regard.
</P>
<P>
Increased efforts for treatment of industrial pollutants in
coastal cities also contributed to the bettering marine conditions.
Dalian city, for instance, invested a total of 1.8 billion yuan in
recent years for sewage treatment, reducing the pollutants
discharged into the Bohai Sea by more than 700,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The province also took special measures to ease pollution from
marine oil exploitation, and set up a special team to handle
accidents related with marine pollution.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 surveillance offices were also set up along the
coast to investigate into the pollution conditions in the sea to
better protect the marine environment, according to officials with
the provincial Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the easing pollution in the Bohai Sea, experts said
the province still faces a grim challenge in protecting the marine
environment and time is needed to completely solve the problem of
marine pollution.
</P>
<P>
With a coast line of nearly 3,000 kilometers, Liaoning has
nearly 70,000 sq. kilometers of offshore area, about a half of its
land area.

<HEADLINE> Car-washing in Beijing Wastes Water: Pupil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A primary school student in Beijing
has estimated that the amount of water used annually to wash cars
in the Chinese capital could fill an area the size of Kunming Lake
in the Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
Young Jin Zhengcheng based his estimation on a year's-worth of
research into the matter, which involved numerous visits to sites
of car washes of the city. He later wrote a study report and
presented it to a seminar on national education in earth
activities. His report was given much heed to by both leaders,
including Beijing mayor Liu Qi, and the public.
</P>
<P>
Based on the fact that about 30 kg of water are used for each
wash and each car-washes handles 20-30 cars daily, the more than
600 car-washes in the Xicheng District alone used about 1.3
million tons of water annually, Jin wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
Jin proposed that a car-washing system be developed that would
recycle soapy water, and called for computerized car-washes that
would regulate the amount of water used for each wash.
</P>
<P>
In response to Jin's report, Beijing's mayor Liu Qi has
reminded the public not to waste water.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Gets Ready to Rebound: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy is predicted to
rebound soon and recover from the crisis, a senior official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We keenly await greater financial inflows from investors and
trading partners who have the sagacity to make an early entry into
our recovering economy," Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab
said when opening a Ministers' Meeting on Investment here.
</P>
<P>
"Opportunities for mutually profitable cooperation are being
opened up by our liberal economic policies. The rewards are
tremendous for those who seize these opportunities," he added.
</P>
<P>
The one-day Ministers' Meeting is being attended by 11 economic
and investment ministers from the Gulf Countries, and Indonesia's
close neighbors such as Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, State Minister of Investment and State-
Owned Enterprises Razi Munir said, "Investment is one of the key
factors to overcome the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We will create a more conducive investment climate, and now
the government is drafting a new investment law that ends all
discrimination between foreign and domestic investment," Munir
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also in the process to review barriers to the flow of
foreign investment to Indonesia ... In the near future we will
simplify the administrative procedures for the incoming
expatriates," he said.
</P>
<P>
In January 2000, he said, foreign investment approved was 99.8
million U.S. dollars covering 57 projects and in the next two
months, foreign investment approved was 232.0 million dollars
covering 111 projects and 475.9 million dollars with 151 projects
respectively.

investors to establish an Investment Fund to finance projects in
Indonesia.

He said foreign investors from the Middle East such as Saudi
Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are ready to support the
investment fund.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Former Deputy PM's Sodomy Trial Postponed Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here announced
Thursday the sodomy trial of Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was postponed indefinitely to allow him to
appeal against the Court's ruling not to call Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad as a witness.
</P>
<P>
High Court Deputy Registrar Rozilah Salleh made the
announcement in court soon after the prosecution and a defense met
Justice Arifin Jaka who has allowed Anwar to appeal against his
decision pertaining to Mahathir's testimony and has agreed to
adjourn the trial until the matter has been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Arifin said in his ruling two weeks ago that to call Mahathir
to testify in the trial would be an abuse of the court process and
it was his duty to refrain such thing from happening.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, who is serving a six-year jail sentence upon
conviction on four charges of corrupt practice of interfering with
police investigations into allegations of his sexual misconduct,
is now jointly tried with his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan
Sasmitaat Madja, 39, on separate charges of sodomizing his former
family driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Both Anwar and Sukma applied to the court to have Mahathir as a
defense witness in his personal capacity.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked from the cabinet on September 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Still Weak Despite Recovery: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite some considerable
improvements have been made recently, the Thai economy remains
fragile, analysts here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai economic growth totaled 5 percent in the first quarter of
this year, driven by a 30.4 percent rise in exports and an 8.8
percent expansion in industrial production, according to the
reports of Thai central bank.
</P>
<P>
The figures are good, however, analysts argued that the
improvement in industrial production is concentrated only in
certain industries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank's reports show the continued economic
recovery is driven mainly by exports, implying that not all
industries have benefited from the recovery, they said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's first-quarter data shows that production
expanded 62.1 percent in the automobile industry, 26.1 percent in
the iron/steel products industry and 8.2 percent in the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
However, during the same period, the beverage, petroleum
products and textile industries have shrunk 30.8 percent, 5.2
percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demand keeps low in the country as purchasing
power of consumers has not yet risen, according to the local
analysts.
</P>
<P>
As for the financial sector, while banks have progressed with
regard to their restructuring efforts, some non-performing loans
have turned non-performing again.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates from the central bank of Thailand put the
financial sector's non-performing loans at about 2 trillion baht (
56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another problem Thai banks now face is low demand for new
credit, said the analysts.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says India's Firing Targets Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said Indian
firing across the Line of Control (LoC) was part of its campaign
to target innocent civilians and raise tensions in Kashmir, the
disputed Himalayan area.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf made this
remarks at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Taking Indian firing at Chakoti sector in Pakistan-administered
part of Kashmir Wednesday, which allegedly killed nine civilians,
Altaf said, "It is Indians who always kill innocent civilians and
raise tensions by firing across LoC," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday's firing is prove of this Indian behavior," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman rejected Indian "propaganda" accusing Pakistan of
cross-LoC firing to help so-called infiltrators sneak into the
India-held part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said Indians carried out firing "with express purpose to
hurt innocent civilians."
</P>
<P>
According to a Pakistan army press release, nine civilian were

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Japan Agree to Extend Scope of Proposed Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Japan have agreed to
extend the scope of the proposed Japan-Singapore Free Trade
Agreement (JSFTA) which is under the joint study set up by
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and former Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi last year.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Singapore Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI) said that Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry
George Yeo and visiting Japanese Minister of International Trade
and Industry Takashi Fukaya agreed in their meeting Wednesday to
incorporate three initiatives into the scope of the proposed JSFTA.
</P>
<P>
MTI said there is a consensus between the two ministers that
the Memorandum of Understanding concerning reinsurance between the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Japan, and
the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of Singapore, will include
reinsurance for exports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the two ministers agreed to initiate a
feasibility study for a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on
product standards between both countries.
</P>
<P>
They also consented to promote the mutual recognition of
electronic signatures and privacy marks in an effort to spur e-
commerce between Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
MTI noted specific details of these initiatives will be
developed by the joint study team under the framework of the JSFTA.
</P>
<P>
During Goh Chok Tong's visit to Japan in December last year, he
reached an agreement with Obuchi to set up a joint study on the
feasibility of establishing a free trade area between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials, academics and business representatives from both
countries have since been discussing the possible scope of the
proposed JSFTA.
</P>
<P>
MTI said the joint study team will be presenting a report to
the prime ministers of the two countries in November 2000 and
recommend whether both countries should commence negotiations for
the JSFTA.
</P>
<P>
Fukaya arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit to Singapore
at the invitation of George Yeo.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A five-day international conference
on urban management will be held here from May 8 to 13, according
to the Nairobi- based United Nations Commission for Human
Settlements (Habitat).
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss how urban problems, including land,
housing, employment, transport and urban governance, can be
tackled through innovation.
</P>
<P>
"The battle for a better world will be won or lost in towns,"
said acting executive director of Habitat Klaus Toepfer on
Thursday, adding: " The future of this planet is linked to the
successful management of urban areas."
</P>
<P>
Over 3 billion people, half of the population on the earth now
live in urban areas, according to a Habitat report.
</P>
<P>
To highlight the importance of urbanization development, 171
nations adopted a agenda aimed at improving urban governance and
management in Istanbul, Turkey, three years ago.
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, the countries will meet to review the
implementation of the agenda. The upcoming meeting in Nairobi is a
preparatory meeting for the 2001 conference.

Over 700 ministers, mayors and representatives of
non-governmental organizations are expected to participate in

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Canada Urge U.S. Not to Implement Missile Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Anna
Lindh and her Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy issued a joint
call on the Svenska Dagbladet daily here Thursday urging the U.S.
not to deploy a proposed nuclear missile shield system to promote
the world's nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said that a unilateral U.S. decision
to go ahead with the system would "jeopardize" the implementation
of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty signed by the U.S. and
Russia and impose a "negative effect" on the nuclear disarmament
and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
They urged the U.S. and Russia to play "greater leading roles"
in promoting the global nuclear disarmament, including more talks
on signing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty III (START III), U.
S. approval of its 1997 agreement with Russia on START II and ABM
Treaty and U.S. Senate approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The two ministers warned that the nuclear threat is again
showing signs of escalating and called for timely efforts to
reverse the disturbing trend.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian final-
status talks on Wednesday dealt with the land proposals for a final
deal prepared by Israel, a senior Palestinian official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who also took part in the talks held at Israel's
southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat, said the Palestinian
negotiators, angered by the Israeli land proposal, briefly walked
out of the talks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who was there
to mandate the talks, managed to bring the sides back together
Wednesday evening, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said it was the first time that Israel had shared
maps, detailing its territorial proposals, with the Palestinians
since the talks began on a final peace treaty last September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which have accepted U.S. involvement, are holding
this round of intensive talks to tackle the thorniest issues such
as the fate of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
This round of talks, which started on Sunday, will last till May
12.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to leave Eilat Thursday to hold discussions with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
return to Eilat on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sezer Most Likely to Win Turkish Presidency as Rival Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The chances for Turkey's
Constitutional Court Chief Judge Ahmet Sezer to win the
presidential race in the third round of parliamentary voting on
Friday were greatly boosted as his main challenger withdrew prior
to the runoff.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Yildirim Akbulut said later Wednesday that he
was pulling out of the race because the support he had received in
the second round of voting made it clear he had no chance to win.
</P>
<P>
He complained that he had come under intense pressure from his
Motherland Party to recede from the competition, but underlined
that he decided to quit by himself, without consulting either his
party or any other party.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut said that he entered the race with the conviction that
he would become the next president, but the anti-democratic
attitude of leaders of the five parties who united in nominating
Sezer curtailed his chances for success.
</P>
<P>
With Akbulut's withdrawal, only six candidates are left in the
presidential race. As the aforementioned government-endorsed
candidate, Sezer is much likely to become Turkey's 10th president
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, supported by leaders of both his
coalition partner parties as well as two opposition parties, has
been urging deputies to elect Sezer as the successor to President
Suleyman Demirel, whose term expires on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Sezer came out on top in the second round on Monday with 314
votes, while Akbulut only got 88 votes.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge failed to garner the two-thirds majority
needed to avoid a third round of voting, but he seems to be sure of
success under the circumstances of Akbulut's give-up as well as the
lowered threshold to be elected.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that votes needed to win the presidential election
will be reduced to a simple majority of 276 in the 550-seat
parliament on Friday's ballot, thus making Sezer, who has
maintained a rising momentum, almost certain to be elected.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Tensions gripped Israel's northern border Wednesday night
after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) warplane dropped a 300 kilograms
bomb on the outskirts of a Lebanese village, wounding 14 people.
The bombing was described as an "operational accident."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas have responded in the
past with Katyusha rocket attacks on the Galilee in retaliation for
Lebanese casualties.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cross-border exchanges of fire could still be
possibly avoided since neither Israel nor Lebanon wants an
escalation of fighting that could jeopardize the planned withdrawal
by the Israel Defense Forces from the security zone by July 7.
</P>
<P>
Ha'arez
</P>
<P>
-- A report by the Israeli Ben-Bassat Commission on tax reform
will be made public Thursday morning at 10:00 a.m. local time and
the recommendations will come into effect on January 1, 2001,
provided they are approved by the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by Finance Ministry Director-General Avi
Ben-Bassat, proposed a sweeping reform package, which includes
lowering taxes on the middle class, imposing taxes on various
savings programs, a 10 percent inheritance tax, a tax on stock
market capital gains by individuals and cancellation of the half-
point tax credit for working wives.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy broke silence on
Wednesday by saying that the government should not transfer Abu Dis
to Palestinian control unless progress is being made in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy suggested the government wait to see flexibility on the
Palestinian side before making any good will gestures.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak earlier in the week proposed
to transfer three Palestinian villages Abu Dis, Azariya and
Swahara, on the outskirts of Jerusalem now under partial
Palestinian control, into full Palestinian control as a confidence
building measure.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Middle East special envoy Dennis Ross said on Wednesday
that more time was needed for the Israelis and Palestinians to
reach a framework deal. He is scheduled to meet Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who joined the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams
in Israeli southern city of Eilat Wednesday, said he would shuttle
between Barak and Arafat as well as the negotiating teams, in an
effort to boost the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ross suggested that despite serious efforts to bridge
differences, meeting the May deadline for the framework deal might
still take some time.

<P>
The primary market shifted to public bond issues amounting to 4.
7 billion ringgit (1.236 billion dollars) comprising mainly
Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and Khazanah (Treasury)
benchmark bonds against matured money market tenders and MGS
totaling 3.80 billion ringgit (1 billion dollars), RAM said in its
publication of RAM BOND Newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency expected the government to issue more longer
term and larger sized bonds as part of the strategy to counteract
excess short-term liquidity.
</P>
<P>
It said the larger volume of new issues contributed to an
active secondary market.
</P>
<P>
However, RAM said the secondary trading for listed bonds in the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange remained bearish with the turnover
declining to 2,912 lots in March from 8,092 lots in the preceding
month.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Asked to Cease Military Operations: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Four elected leaders of the
Philippine Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Thursday
appealed to President Joseph Estrada to cease military operations
against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and continue
peace talks, a TV report said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN news channel quoted the Muslim leaders as saying
that the president might have been misled by the military by
adopting a tough stance against the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"If there is anybody to blame for the worsening hostilities
and state of anarchy in Central Mindanao, it is the AFP (Armed
Forces of the Philippines) field commanders who insist on a
military solution to the problem," the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the military officials do not care whether the
whole of Mindanao is transformed into a battle field.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, armed conflict escalated in the southern
island of Mindanao as fierce fightings broke out between
government troops and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said the clashes between the two sides, which
started last Friday, had already left more than 128 people dead,
and thousands of civilians homeless.
</P>
<P>
Both government troops and MILF rebels vowed to continue their
fighting. The MILF unilaterally suspended Sunday the peace
negotiation with the government and threatened to launch an "all-
out offensive" against local government installations.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, EU Sign Trade in Textiles Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and the European Union (
EU) Thursday signed an agreement on trade in textile cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Cambodia's textile products, from now on,
can formally get access to the EU market quota-free as well as
duty-free.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Cham Prasidh, minister of commerce
and Michel Caillouet, ambassador-head of the delegation of the
European Commission to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been implemented on an informal basis since
August 1, 1999 and will expire at the end of 2002. Duty-free
access for Cambodian textiles to the EU has been granted since the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The EU welcomed the efforts of the Cambodian government to
improve working conditions in the textile sector and looked
forward to a continued improvement in labor conditions.
Furthermore, the EU hailed recent Cambodian government actions to
crackdown on garment export license fraud.
</P>
<P>
European Union is one of the major financial supporters to
Cambodia. The EU's financial support since 1992 has accounted for
about one third of the total external assistance received by
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has more than 170 garment factories with about 110,
000 workers.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, whose three military
officers were kept captive by rebels in Sierra Leone, is
monitoring the situation before deciding whether to send a team to
negotiate the release of the officers, Defense Minister Najib Tun
Razak said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that rebels in Sierra Leone freed
Malaysian military officer Maj. Ganase Jaganathan Wednesday night,
who was taken by rebels on May 1 together with two other foreign

But they (rebels) are still holding two more Malaysian officers
at separate locations in that country since Wednesday, he added.

The authorities are sparing no efforts to secure the release of
Lt Col. Hamzah Bachik and Lt. Cdr. Aminuddin Rashid, he told
reporters after launching a foundation for serving soldiers and
veterans.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Moves Closer to Free Air Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) member states are moving closer to free
air transport, COMESA director of infrastructure development
Jerome Ntibarekerwa has said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Thursday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying
in an interview here on Wednesday that the organization is happy
that a number of countries have seen the need to implement the
program.
</P>
<P>
Several countries are implementing the first phase of the
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, some member countries confirmed that
 they were committed to the air transport program but difficulties
arising from certain restrictions such as visas inhibition for the
free movement of people.
</P>
<P>
Ntibarekerwa appealed to COMESA members to quickly sign the
memorandum of understanding for the Communication Navigation
Surveyors/Air Transport Management in the interest of the Air
Transport program.
</P>
<P>
Twelve out of the 21 member states have already signed the
memorandum of understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said once the liberalization of air transport is fully
implemented, it would help reduce air-fares to make them more
affordable and help the member states have more resources.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Declares No Change in Cyprus Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
has indicated no flexibility in his two-state confederation formula
as a way out of the decades-long Cyprus crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to reach a settlement on the basis of equality of
the two peoples of the island. For this, the world must tell the
Greek Cypriot leadership that it is not the government of the
entire island," said Denktash at a conference on "International
Developments and Their Impact on Cyprus" in Istanbul Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the statement after he was re-elected late last
month for a fifth straight term as "president of the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," a breakaway entity solely recognized
by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split since 1974 when troops from Turkey took
over the northern third of the island in reaction to a coup in
Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island with
a bizonal, bicommunal federtion formula, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have been deadlocked by
the
insistence of the Turkish side for the recognition of the breakaway
state and the rejection of Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that the Republic of Cyprus enjoys
international recognition as the sole legitimate government of the
island, the Cypriot leader said it has no jurisdiction over
northern Cyprus, adding that some headway has been achieved in
explaining this fact to the world.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the international recognition of the Republic of
Cyprus as the sole government of the entire island for what he
called the main stumbling block stalling a settlement on the
eastern Mediterranean island for the past 37 years.
</P>
<P>
Under a renewed effort by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
revitalize the peace moves on Cyprus, the U.N. special envoy for
Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, conducted two rounds of indirect or so-
called proximity talks with Denktash and Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides in New York in December and Geneva earlier this
year. No tangible results were reported. A third round was arranged
on May 23 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the forthcoming talks in New York, Denktash said
that the talks will be "difficult."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report from Nicosia, President Glafcos
Clerides was hospitalized on Tuesday and is expected to undergo
minor surgery on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Learning of Clerides' medical problem, Denktash wished Clerides
to have a speedy recovery and said that the New York talks will
have to be postponed until a later date.

Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to search for
natural gas and oil in Egypt's Western Desert. Under the deal, the
American firm will spend 4 million U.S. dollars on oil and natural
gas prospecting in a 14,000 square kilometers region of the Western
Desert concession area near Al-Dior.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Sources at the Central Bank of Egypt said no portion of the

government's debts. And about 2 billion Egyptian pounds (about 579.
7 million U.S. dollars) were pumped in liquid cash to end the
current liquidity shortage.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Sixty-five pieces of antiquities displayed in 19 showcases
represent the unique repertoire of the mummification museum, the
only one of its kind in the world, that occupies an area of 360
square meters overlooking the Nile in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the exhibits and the surrounding atmosphere of dim
lighting and solemn silence engulf the place with an awe-inspiring
feeling.

desert city of Palmyra Wednesday on the future of Syrian-Israeli
peace talks suspended since January.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Planes Flying Wrong Flight Path to Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Aircraft landing at the
Palestinians- controlled Gaza International Airport had recently
used the wrong flight paths and endangered Israeli fighter jets
patrolling the area, Israeli military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Planes which land at Gaza International Airport are supposed to
do so on agreed flight paths and in accordance with agreed
procedures," the military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Recently planes have started arriving without prearrangement,
on incorrect flight paths and against procedures, creating a safety
risk by crossing flight zones used by Israel Air Force (IAF)
planes," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued to explain why IAF fighter jets
prevented on Wednesday an Egyptian civilian aircraft from landing
at the Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
An EgyptAir Boeing 737 flying from Cairo to Gaza with 32
passengers on board was intercepted by two Israeli fighter jets and
forced to turn back.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Wednesday that the Boeing 737 was
using a new air corridor recently introduced by Egypt for flights
from Cairo to Gaza which has replaced the old route north of El-
Arish. But they said Israel had not agreed to the change.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that Gaza International Airport has
virtually closed down because Israel denied landing permission to
the Egyptian plane and a Moroccan jet earlier in the week.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Petrol Trade Takes up Partial Tanzanian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Illegal petroleum imports and
dumping are taking up 25 to 30 percent of the Tanzanian market,
depriving the government of large revenue from fuel levy, the
African newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The illegal trade, which is rampant in the western and northern
parts of the country, is partly due to the liberalization of
importation of petroleum products, according to a report recently
issued by Tanzanian Ministry of Works.
</P>
<P>
The current price of fuel in Tanzania is higher than in
neighboring countries and this price difference is the major cause
of illegal fuel imports and dumping, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The government is about to introduce a bio-coding mechanism to
control fuel smuggling and dumping, the document said, adding that
this measure is expected to provide 20 percent additional revenue
to the current collections.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also proposed to change the tax structure for
petroleum products, saying that an increase in the price of fuel
may lead to increased incentives for smuggling and dumping of the
products.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Expects IMF Aid in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is expecting
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to resume its support to the
country in July this year, the East African Standard newspaper
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to concluding talks with the IMF and the World
Bank so that we can begin to have access to the international
resources we need to accelerate our economic recovery by July or
early August," Finance Minister Chris Okemo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A team from the IMF and the World Bank is scheduled to arrive
in Kenya on Thursday on a 20-day mission to complete assessment
and negotiation of terms for renewal of aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team will discuss in detail the country's Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategic Paper which outlines the medium
macro-economic framework and sector policies, programs, activities
and time-scales for reducing poverty, Okemo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF team will also review all aspects of Kenya's
economy, focusing on such key areas as the budget performance in
1999/2000 and projection in 2000/2001, expenditure framework, the
balance of payments and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Kenya, the team will also carry out a
detailed review of the measures so far taken by the country to
improve governance and structural reforms including privatization
policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Okemo, his government is speeding up the
privatization process and expects to raise 7 billion shillings
(about 96 million U.S. dollars ) to 12 billion shillings (about
162 million U.S. dollars) from the process between now and the
next financial year.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, the IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar aid
package to Kenya for reasons of poor governance and corruption,
which brought the country's economy and financial market to steep
decline.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Benefits From Liberalization of Coffee Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The liberalization of coffee
industry in Uganda has relieved the government from providing
coffee crop finance and fixing prices, with the farmers' earnings
greatly improved, the New Vision daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At pre-liberalization, farmers were earning between 20 to 30
percent of the coffee sales, today farmers are earning 70 percent
of the coffee sales," Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Tourism, Trade and Industry Moses Ali was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Uganda Coffee Conference and
Exhibition 2000 here on Wednesday, Ali said that in 1980s, Uganda
used to produce 2 million bags of coffee (60 kilograms per bag),
but now the country is producing about 4 million bags and is being
ranked among the biggest producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, sponsored by Uganda Coffee Trade
Federation and Uganda Coffee Development Authority and attended by
over 250 delegates, has brought together international coffee
players including traders and roasters.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali, the challenges now facing the Ugandan coffee
industry include quality control measures, promotion of production
of quality coffee using fumigation and pest controls.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Uganda's leading foreign exchange earner. During the
1998- 1999 financial year, coffee exports reached 214,060 tons
worth 302.6 million U.S. dollars, contributing about 60 percent
of the country's total foreign earnings.

<HEADLINE> Study Urges U.S. Authorities to Help Repair Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A study released Wednesday
claimed deteriorating U.S. public schools need an estimated 322
billion dollars for repairs and updated technology, a figure 10
times greater than what states now spend annually on school
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
While states are spending more than ever on school
modernization, the need for funding is eclipsing their efforts,
the National Education Association (NEA) said in its state-by-
state study.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, too many of our students attend schools plagued
by leaky roofs, faulty wiring and outdated plumbing," the report
said. "And too many sit in classrooms -- nearly half -- that lack
adequate wiring for Internet access."
</P>
<P>
The total figure highlights a need for 268 billion dollars for
repairs and construction of schools and 54 billion dollars for
wiring and networking schools for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
New York schools, according to the study, have the most dire
need for funding, with a modernization price tag of 50.7 billion
dollars. Also near the top of the list are California with 32.9
billion dollars in funding needs, Ohio with 25.1 billion dollars
and New Jersey with a need for 22 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vermont schools need the least amount of money at 333 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The NEA study comes at a time when many states have amassed
substantial surpluses, and the teacher's union said states should
tap into some of that revenue to make immediate, large-scale
investments in school modernization.
</P>
<P>
Although education is a state responsibility, the U.S. federal
government has a long history of providing states and localities
with financial assistance, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, NEA President Steve Chase said the
union is pushing for Congress to pass school modernization
assistance that includes interest subsidies and direct grants and
loans that will address the funding needs.

<HEADLINE> Romania Registers Large Foreign Currency Inflows in First Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency inflows in
Romania during the first four months of this year have been
extremely high despite relatively low credibility of the Romanian
market, the Ziarul Financiar daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inflows allowed the National Bank of Romania (the country's
central bank) to purchase almost 750 million U.S. dollars from the
foreign exchange market during the period. The central bank thus
managed to pay part of the debts and increase its foreign currency
reserves, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In April, the central bank bought almost 245 million U.S.
dollars, practically twice the amount registered in February and
35 million U.S. dollars more than in March.
</P>
<P>
During the last two months, the foreign currency supply
exceeded demand almost daily, helping the central bank to
consolidate its foreign currency reserves that at the end of April
reached the level of almost 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, as well as
to support the depreciation needed for the domestic currency leu.
</P>
<P>
In April, the leu depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 3.06
percent, while since the beginning of this year it has lost 9.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the end of March, the foreign currency
reserves of the central bank increased by 62.5 million U.S.
dollars. Net purchases of foreign currency, worth 245 million U.S.
dollars, were largely used to restitute short-term deposits, which
totaled 103 million U.S. dollars, and to buy back foreign currency-
denominated government bonds worth 38 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold reserve grew up to 104.1 tons. But in the context of a
poor quotation of gold in the foreign market, its value increased
by a mere 3 million U.S. dollars, totaling now 923 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's international reserves (currency plus gold)
currently overshoot the value of 2.6 billion U.S dollars, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Diesel Makers Eye Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Overseas diesel engine makers are
casting their eyes on China's huge potential market, although such
production is highly restricted in China.
</P>
<P>
China needs more engines to provide power for the rapid growth
of its transportation, construction and automotive sectors,
according to latest issue of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
But outdated diesel engines used in the past contributed to the
country's air pollution problems and irritated people in traffic.
</P>
<P>
Seven foreign diesel and auto parts producers inaugurated a
green diesel initiative in China about a month ago aiming to
overcome the diesel engine's bad image and to promote modern
engines as part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
The companies, including Cummins, DaimlerChrysler, Caterpillar,
Isuzu, Bosch, Dana and Volvo Trunk, advocate the adoption and
strict equal enforcement of emission standards based on an engine'
s performance in China.
</P>
<P>
As part of the initiative, the companies will host technical
seminars in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangzhou, to
disseminate information about modern diesel engines and their
advantages in emission reduction.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The cause for the Kenyan Airways jet
crash in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, late January has not been
established because the black box was blank with no parameters
inside, according to Kenya Information, Transport and
Communication Minister Musalia Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times Thursday quoted Mudavadi as saying that the
investigating team was now retrieving the wreckage on the floor of
the Atlantic in hope to find out the clues to crash.

In the first official statement on the investigation of the
tragedy, which killed 169 people on board, Mudavadi said the
initial investigations indicated the aircraft's two engines were
operating normally.
</P>

It was still not clear why the aircraft plunged suddenly soon
after take- off from the western African country, the minister

KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Members of Parliament (MPs)

<P>
In its report yet to be submitted to the House for debate, the

shall address and give justification for the deployment of troops
outside the country to Parliament" so that the parliamentarians
can decide from an informed position.

The committee also proposed that the President may, with the
approval of Parliament given by resolution supported by not less
than half of all MPs, deploy UPDF troops outside Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Deployment of troops is a serious national issue which
involves loss of lives and funds," the committee said, stressing

present."

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian pop siren Shania Twain
won Entertainer of the Year prize and the Dixie Chicks won group
and album prizes for "Fly" at the 35th annual Academy of Country
Music Awards (ACMA) Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Twain, who had stayed away from this year's Grammys and
American Music Awards, where she won two awards each, was a no-
show this time, too. Event producer Dick Clark said she was at
home in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Twain's current album, "Come On Over," has sold almost 13
million copies in the United States after 130 weeks of release.
</P>
<P>
It was a big night for country sweethearts, even though leading
nominees Tim McGraw and wife Faith Hill lost in the Entertainer of
the Year category.
</P>
<P>
Each won their second consecutive Vocalist of the Year awards
and Hill also won top video prize for "Breathe."
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-member academy also voted the duet "When I Said I Do"
by Clint Black and actress-wife Lisa Hartman Black as the Vocal
Event of the Year. Black had not won an ACM trophy since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the rookie artist section, 16-year-old Jessica Andrews was
named top new female vocalist, while Brad Paisley took the male
award and hot duo Montgomery Gentry the group award.
</P>
<P>
The 35th annual ceremony was hosted at the Universal
Amphitheater by country veteran Dolly Parton. She joined forces
with Martina McBride, Patty Loveless, Naomi and Wynonna Judd to
sing "Stand By Your Man" as part of a tribute to the late "first
lady of country music" Tammy Wynette.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Economical Fingerprint Identification System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say they have
developed the world's most economical fingerprint identification
system.
</P>
<P>
The new system, just half the size of a business card, was
created by scientists in a high-tech development zone in Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to chief developer Qiu Boyun, the new system can
memorize up to 3,500 fingerprints and costs less than 500 yuan (
about 60.2 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A traditional fingerprint recognition system costs at least 6,
000 yuan (about 722.8 dollars) as it heavily depends on advanced
computer technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his colleagues will soon present an even smaller
fingerprint recognition system, which is on a card the size of a
stamp and can search 1,000 fingerprints per second.
</P>
<P>
The system can be widely used in security systems, including
those in computers, car and door locks, and electronic commerce
systems.
</P>
<P>
Zhongzheng Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., is now
producing the system in small batches.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong electronic industry
will pay more attention to the semi-conductor industry in the
Chinese mainland in the future and give as much venture capital as
possible to these firms.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China' Daily" quoted Samson Tam, chairman of the Hong
Kong Electronic Industry Association (HKEIA) as saying that the
rapid development of the Chinese mainland's electronic and
information industry has attracted Hong Kong entrepreneurs eager
to tap the country's vast market potential.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has witnessed a boom of information technology
companies over recent years, and the central government's stimulus
policies to attract venture capital into the high-technology
sector has also paid off, said Tam, who is also the chairman of
Group Sense (International) Ltd, a manufacturer of such products.
</P>
<P>
Tam headed a business delegation of Hong Kong high-tech
entrepreneurs who visited Beijing recently to look into the
mainland's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we want to see how the central government
promotes the transfer of traditional industries to new industries,
" Tam said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's pending entry into the World Trade Organization
could improve conditions by bringing more business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the success of Hong Kong's electronic industry must
be based on close co-operation with domestic semi-conductor
factories," Tam said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's GDP Estimated at 6 Pct in Fiscal 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy is estimated to
grow about 6 percent in the current fiscal year ending on July 15,
2000,reaching a record high in the last six fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures by the Central Bureau of
Statistics(CBS), available here Thursday, the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP)for the current fiscal year is estimated to reach 5.
99 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual GDP projection by CBS is in line with the estimates
in April by the Asian Development Bank, which put the growth of
Nepali GDP at 5 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the impressive growth in GDP is
attributed to bumper growth in major food crops and robust rebound
in the manufacturing activities, said CBS in a report.
</P>
<P>
Major food crops are estimated to grow by over 7.77 percent,
boosting the overall agriculture sector growth to 4.99 percent,
while non-agriculture sector is expected to grow about 7 percent,
it said.
</P>
<P>
CBS figures showed an increase of agriculture sector and a
decline in the non-agriculture sector's contribution to the GDP,
heralding one of the significant changes in the structure of
Nepalese economy to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution of agriculture sector has slightly declined
to 40.1 percent from earlier 40.4 percent, while the share of non-
agriculture sector in GDP has increased from 59.6 percent to 59.9
percent," said CBS.
</P>
<P>
As Nepal is an agrarian country, agricultural production has
occupied a large proportion of its GDP. To boost the economy, the
Nepali government has focused on export-oriented industrial
productions in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing sector has improved impressively with its
contribution to the GDP estimated at a record high of 12 percent
in the current fiscal year, compared with 5.69 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Nepali GDP grew by 7.2 percent in the fiscal year 1992/93 and
slipped into recession since then. In the last six fiscal years,
it grew by an average of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Plan for E-commerce in Subic Freeport Bared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA) has bared plans to make this freeport a perfect
area where enterprises can embark on e-commerce, Philippine News
Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We want Subic the cutting edge in information technology (IT)
in the country and part of this is to differentiate the Freeport
from other economic zones by exploiting technology for its
investors," SBMA Chairman Felicito Payumo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted significant strides the SBMA has achieved in
developing its IT backbone under a strategy he calls "e-Subic"
that will make e-commerce possible.
</P>
<P>
According to Payumo, an inter-department group within SBMA has
been formed to develop strategies in achieving the goal of making
Subic a center of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Among its initial plans is a conference on e-commerce that will
be attended by leading global players in the IT industry, the head
of the Subic authority said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the SBMA Data Center houses 13 powerful Sun servers
which operate 24 hours by seven days providing internet connection
to the authority.
</P>
<P>
It uses Fiber Optic Cables with an approximate speed of 100
mbps(megabytes/sec.) with a firewall that secures the network from
unauthorized access. There are presently 300 users in the Freeport
with unlimited access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The SBMA has already adopted e-commerce in transacting business
with potential locators through it Investor Handling System and
further plans to put in automation all transactions of the SBMA
including its port operations.
</P>
<P>
With the technology and immediate plans in place, the SBMA is
set to introduce e-commerce to various industries in the freeport
and their clientele.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's National Convention Process in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The process of Myanmar's National
Convention, which has been held intermittently since January 1993
to draw up a new state constitution, is going on well but to take
some more time to complete it for the coming up of the
constitution, said official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung who met part of the
local and foreign newsmen here Wednesday, the paper said the
system to be drawn up should be a long-standing one, adding that
for this reason it is taking a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in the past, Myanmar had two state
constitutions, of which the 1947 Constitution allowed the states
to secede away from the union after 10 years, pointing out that
this constitution was and is really a fundamental problem for the
country to draw up a new state constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We have people fighting for their own land. Now we are trying
to solve this problem by political means," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for stopping the fightings and seeking ways to reach
the political solution, emphasizing the need for a very strong
constitution to be agreed upon by all the people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar National Convention has been adjourned up to now
since March 1996 after fundamental principles for six chapters out
of 15 for drawing up the new state constitution were laid down
which are "Fundamental Principles", "Structure of State", "Head of
State","Legislature", "Executive" and "Judiciary".
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar national convention is a follow-up of the 1990
multi-party general election. The present Myanmar military
government said it will transfer back the state power, which it
took over in September 1988, to a constitutional government.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP Growth Over 4 pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are sure, though still being conservative, in saying that
the first quarter's gross domestic product (GDP) stands at over 4
percent," local leading newspapers Thursday quoted the bank's
deputy governor Achjar Ilyas as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the growth to strong exports and domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for 2000 GDP growth would be over 4 percent as
well,he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's stronger exports are supported by higher oil and
gas prices and a sharp increase in the volume of non-oil and gas
products which the country produces for the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports in the first three months reached 14.099
billion U.S. dollars or increased by 38.7 percent compared to the
same period last year. Meanwhile, import value increased by 17.49
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic consumption side, there was strong growth,
particularly in the industrial and utility sectors (electricity,
water and gas).
</P>
<P>
Achjar said that Bank Indonesia saw Indonesia's macroeconomic
developments were on the right track, with interest rates being
kept low and inflation rates under control.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in April stood at 0.56 percent, lower than
the predicted 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the rupiah exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has
been depressed lately. Achjar said this was due to negative
sentiments created by the postponement of the International
Monetary Fund's loan disbursement as well as the downgrading of
the country's foreign currency credit rating due to technical
issues.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Placed on War Footing Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to mobilize the entire country on a war footing to battle
separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the
official Daily News said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The current temporary setbacks in the north would be combated
with resilience and motivation," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision followed a series of stunning
military advances by the LTTE rebels during the past two weeks in
the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who are fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in
Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have captured several key
army camps and advanced to within 40 kilometers of the main
northern town of Jaffna, their former stronghold, which they lost
to government troops in 1995.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga told her cabinet of ministers
on Wednesday that the government would take tough new measures to
combat the LTTE rebels while at the same time continuing unabated
efforts to
find solutions to the ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decided to victoriously complete the war as soon as
possible by mustering all energies and circumventing temporary
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Funds for non-essential development work will be diverted to
the war effort. The recent salary increase of ministers will be
frozen from this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Public Security Act was enforced with effect
from Wednesday to ban all activities designed to encourage
terrorism and disrupt the normal activities of the people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Team Manager Hopeful of Thomas Cup Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's badminton team manager
Sumaryono expressed optimism about the men's shuttlers chance of
retaining the Thomas Cup for the 12th time in the Thomas and Uber
Cup championships in Kuala Lumpur next week.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic about retaining the Thomas Cup,
especially if the shuttlers are in good physician condition. We
must be able to field the right players, especially in the singles
events on the basis of previous matches. We must avoid applying
the wrong strategy. For instance, if a shuttler only wins once in
six meets with this rival, we must field another player," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaryono, who was appointed team manager on Tuesday, said he
was not worried about the men's doubles players.
</P>
<P>
"Without any intention of being arrogant, I think our men's
doubles are still in top position in the world," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sumaryono was realistic about the Uber Cup target.
</P>
<P>
"If our shuttlers can't win the Uber Cup why should we force
them to do so. Of course, we have to boost their fighting spirit,
but if technically we are far behind other countries, it will be
meaningless," he added.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Competition in China's Ice Cream Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign ice cream
producers are expected to face stiffer competition in the large
Chinese market with the coming of the summer heat, "China Daily"
said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Food and Drink Industries Association
show that the annual growth rate of the ice cream industry is 105
percent since 1987.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 ice cream companies, including world famous
ones such as the Wall's of Britain and Nestle of Switzerland, have
introduced new products to China, with total annual production
exceeding 1 million liters last year.
</P>
<P>
Although overall sales volume of ice cream in China dropped by
8 percent last year, Wall's, affiliated with Unilever, has doubled
its sales volume and took around 20 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Price-cutting has been the strategy of many ice cream
manufactures to survive the fierce competition. Wall's slashed its
prices 25-30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, this year, "there will be no price cut, for lowering
price at the expense of quality will only make us lose consumers,
said Ter-Kulve, the newly appointed general manager of Wall's (
China) Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumer Association on ice
cream markets showed consumers considered taste and quality first
when buying ice cream.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges Full Commitment to Implementing  LoI With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"President Gus Dur (Abdurrahman Wahid) has stated he will be
more committed to implementing the programs in the LoI", Singh
said after a final meeting to review the document's contents
between an IMF technical team and a team of Indonesia's economic
ministers here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the talks with the Indonesian
government and was confident of Indonesia's commitment to press
ahead with its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very encouraged by the full commitment of the
economic team, including the president. There's no doubt that they
're completely committed to implementing the program," he was
quoted by national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, five matters the president needed to focus
on were fiscal problems, the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency,
reforms in the financial sector, private debt restructuring and
Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Indonesian government and IMF have completed
the review of Indonesia's reform measures but both sides could not
sign a new deal as it needs approval first from the IMF's board.
</P>
<P>
Singh said the new LoI would be taken to Washington for
approval by the fund's managing director and later by its
executive board.
</P>
<P>
"There may be changes between now and then. So at this stage,
the LoI is not final," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said the signing was expected to be done on
June 5 at the latest while disbursement of IMF aid was expected
several days afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie declined to provide details of the new LoI,
simply saying the LoI contained the same economic measures listed
in the LoI signed with the fund in January, plus a new set of
deadlines and additional programs.
</P>
<P>
With previous letters of intent, the coordinating minister for
the economy, finance and industry signed the LoI as the government
's representative.
</P>
<P>
With the new LoI, however, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril
Sabirin must also sign the LoI because the central bank is now
independent of the government. A number of the reform measures
contained in the new LoI are aimed at Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was expected to make a second loan disbursement of some
400 million U.S. dollars in early April, but delayed the
disbursement because the government failed to meet the March 31
deadline to implement a host of key economic measures.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Facing Challenge in Mindanao By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hostage-takings, bombings, and fierce
armed clashes... All these unfortunate human tragedies have taken
places now in Mindanao, the Southern Philippines. And the tension
there seems increasing.
</P>
<P>
Now, the government has to confront with three anti-government
groups in Mindanao, namely, the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the New People's Arm --
the armed wing of the National Democratic Front (NDF).
</P>
<P>
Although the three groups have not formed an alliance against
the government, their individual actions recently have proved a
big headache for Manila, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, government troops recovered 15 of the 27 hostages
held by the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf in Basilan since March 20,
but these people were rescued with very heavy price -- at least 10
government soldiers were killed and dozens wounded in their
operations in the past two weeks. Also, four hostages were found
dead,the rest are still in the hands of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Despite a claim by government troops that they could rescue the
remaining hostages in Basilan within one or two days, the
operations are definitely a tough job since the rebels are staying
in jungles where landmines were planted.
</P>
<P>
In Sulu, another group of Abu Sayyaf members are holding 21
tourist hostages, who were taken from a Malaysia diving resort on
April 23.On Wednesday, the rebels said that two hostages died in
an encounter with government army. The claim still has to be
verified.
</P>
<P>
Beset by two hostage crises, the government is trying to
resolve them by different strategies, to rescue Basilan hostages
by force, to rescue Sulu hostage by talks.
</P>
<P>
But so far, the government efforts seem not every effective,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has failed to rescue the hostages held by the
Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and another group of hostages held by the
Abu Sayyaf splinter group in Jolo (Sulu). The more it is shown
that the government's rescue operations are ineffectual, the more
defiant the Abu Sayyaf, as well and the MILF, would become," said
the Philippine Daily Inquirer in an editorial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hostage crises, Manila has to defeat the 15,
000-strong MILF or bring them back to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, the MILF, which is fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, have attacked government
army camps, government buildings and highways in four Mindanao
Provinces:Maguindanao, North Cotabato, South Cotabato and Lanao
del Norte.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the fighting is considered by observers here as
the widest since the breakdown of the 1997 ceasefire agreement
between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting, which started Friday, has already left
more than 128 people dead, and thousands of civilians homeless. (

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government will take
drastic steps against kidnapping rampant in the country, said
Commander of the Military Forces General Fernando Tapias Stahelin
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting attended by Defense Minister Luis Acuna and top
army and police officers, Stahelin said such measures would
include political, military and legal aspects.
</P>
<P>
The military would especially suppress criminal activities by
guerrillas, such as tax collection from enterprises by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (RAFC), Stahelin added.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Visbal Martelo, president of the National Trade Union
Council, also urged Congress and the government to continue the
program of empowering the armed forces to strike at guerrilla
crimes.
</P>
<P>
About 60 children were abducted during the first three months
of the year, up one-third from 1999, according to the independent
anti-kidnapping group Pais Libre.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Serbs to Boycott OSCE-Organized Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Serb minority in Yugoslavia's
southwestern province of Kosovo said on Wednesday that they will
boycott a census and an election of a new local government, both
to be conducted this year by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
At a rally in northern Kosovska Mitrovica city, the Serbs said
it is not conformable to the principle of ethnic equality to
conduct a census and elections in Kosovo at a time when the free
movement of Serb residents is still not guaranteed and 350,000 non-
Albanian refugees have not yet returned.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, they said that
instead, Kosovo Serbs will take part in a nationwide census to be
conducted by the Yugoslav government next year.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to related parties in Kosovo to create conditions
for the safe return of refugees as soon as possible, and called on
the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force to guarantee the safety of
returned refugees.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo last summer,
the United Nations Special Mission has been in charge of
administering the mainly-Albanian province.
</P>
<P>
Since then, tens of thousands of Serbs and other non-Albanian
residents have fled the area after ethnic Albanian extremists
launched waves of vindictive attacks against them.

SANTIAGO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chilean exported 616.5 million U.S.
dollars worth of wood in the first quarter of this year, up 32.4
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Jose Ignacio Letamendi, the President of the Chilean Wood
Corporation, said Wednesday that the high income was mainly due to
the increase in the volume and prices of cellulose.
</P>
<P>
The products with higher demand were whitened cellulose, sawed
wood and round logs, Letamendi added.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the wood exports would earn Chile 2.3 billion

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
today's major Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- People's Daily today published the ninth of a series of
commentaries on the country's strategy to develop the western
region, saying that the strategy will help accelerate economic
development of the area and promote national unity.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese government will encourage the country's
industrial and scientific sectors to work together more on vital
research projects in a bid to speed up the use of high-tech
findings.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of science and technology, called on
governments at all levels to help link scientists with businesses
to develop high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
In China, insufficient investments in research and development
block technological innovation and the commercialization of new
technological discoveries, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
 "China Youth Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao stressed that young people
need to grow up in a good environment on the eve of the May Fourth
Movement.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remark Wednesday while visiting a community in
Hepingjie Street of Beijing's Chaoyang District. He enjoyed a
choral performance and talked with teenagers in an Internet cafe,
saying that he was delighted that the Internet is becoming an
important part of the young people's life.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of CPC Central Committee, stressed the prevention of
negative effects of the Internet on young people, emphasizing that
urban communities should play a key role in satisfying the people

<HEADLINE> China's Employment, Distribution Structures Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The proportions of employees in
State-owned and collectively-owned enterprises have shrunk
drastically in China, but those in the private sector have
snowballed, a recent survey indicated.
</P>
<P>
Also, the largely egalitarian practice in income distribution
has been replaced by one featuring " the more you work, the more
you earn."
</P>
<P>
The survey by the National Bureau of Statistics with assistance
from seven other government departments, sampled 170,000 residents
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 43.8 and 9.5 percent of the 206.8 million work force
in cities worked in the State and collective enterprises
respectively, as against 78.3 percent and 21.5 percent
respectively in 1978.
</P>
<P>
And the survey showed that in 1998, 22.9 percent worked in
individual- or family-owned businesses, and another 12.8 percent
worked in other forms of entities. But in 1978 merely 0.2 percent
of the work force was in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
With a series of reforms in the social economic structure,
there is a growing wage gap among urban citizens and employees
with different educational attainments. The average monthly income
for urban residents in August 1999 was 685 yuan (about 82 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
People with college or higher degrees, 12 percent of the total
employees, had the highest average income of 980 yuan. While
illiterate persons were at the bottom with only 481 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In China, the youngest group of workers have higher educational
level and are best paid, a contrast to most developed countries
where middle-aged people earned the most.
</P>
<P>
People aged 41 to 45 earn 30 percent less on average than those
under 30, as most of the middle-aged in China grew up during the "
cultural revolution" from 1966 to 1976, when the educational
system in China was disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Because of laid-off workers in the cities, impoverished
families became a serious problem. In August 1999, the per capita
income of 6 percent of urban families was less than 100 yuan per
month.
</P>
<P>
In cities in Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, the impoverished urban families
accounted for more than 10 percent of the total. While the
proportion in the relatively prosperous cities in the east, such
as Beijing and Tianjin, was less than one percent.

<HEADLINE> Most Czechs Favor Resumption of Death Penalty: Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Czechs favor the
resumption of the death penalty in the country's criminal law, a
recent opinion poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Some 61 percent of the Czech citizens were dissatisfied with
the abolition of capital punishment and strongly demanded its
resumption, while only 26 percent were opposed to the idea of
resuming death sentence and 13 percent made no comments, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Following the example of some Western countries, the Czech
authorities rescinded the death penalty in May 1990. Since then,
public order in the country has worsened, with the number of
criminal cases rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that in recent years, the number of
criminal cases in the Czech Republic stood at about 400,000 each
year, almost double that before 1990 when the death penalty was
annulled.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the premature abolition of the
death penalty, a proper deterrent to unpardonable criminals, is
one of the factors that has led to the worsening public order in
the country.

<HEADLINE> West Ham Escapes FA Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- West Ham have escaped disciplinary
action from the Football Association of England, following Tuesday
evening's Premiership bust-up against Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Hammers players surrounded referee Paul Durkin at the final
whistle, after Emmanuel Petit's controversial late goal and Trevor
Sinclair's sending off had given the Gunners a 2-1 win.
</P>
<P>
At a disciplinary meeting on Wednesday, the FA decided not to
impose any punishment on the club, though midfielders Marc-Vivien
Foe and John Mancur have been charged individually with misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Foe could be handed a stiff penalty after allegedly pushing
Durkin, while Moncur faces punishment for comments he made to the
referee after the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
FA Spokesman Steve Double said the FA would write to West Ham
to "remind them of their responsibility for the behaviour of their
players".
</P>
<P>
He said: "We will also be expressing our concern over the
general conduct of their players, particularly as they had an
unusually high number of yellow cards."
</P>
<P>
In total Durkin not only sent off winger Trevor Sinclair for
two bookable offences but also showed the yellow card to six other
Hammers players.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Speaker Calls for Arab Action to End Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly
Saadoun Hamadi on Thursday called for concerted efforts by Arab
countries to help lifting the decade-old international sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the
ongoing 103rd conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)
which was opened Sunday to discuss world peace and security as well
as ways of promoting dialogue between cultures and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said governments of Arab countries had endeavored to
put an end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people under the
crippling sanctions, but more jobs need to be done for this end.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 1.5 million Iraqi citizens died under the
sanctions, which was imposed on Iraq after the 1990 Gulf crisis,
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 Iraqi children die of malnutrition or lack of
medicine each month, he said, adding that about 1 million children
had dropped out of school due to deteriorating living conditions
and rising unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi renewed Iraq's claim that it had eliminated all its
weapons of massive destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations so far had sent 246 inspection groups
or some 2,500 arms experts to Iraq, and conducted 6,931 inspection
tours over 386 civilian and military sites in his country, and
found no traces and evidence of weapons of mass destruction at all.
</P>

LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern arrived in Nortern Ireland on
Thursday to step up the pace in the effort to find a breakthrough
in the Northern Ireland peace process.

the two governments have been meeting the parties, but the impasse
between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein over Irish Republican
Army arms and sharing power has remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Democratic Party leader Gary McMichael expressed concern
about the apparent lack of "firm proposals on the table"following
his meeting with the prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be in a position very soon where there are concrete
ideas being actively discussed between all of the parties."
</P>
<P>
Among the other smaller pro-agreement parties involved in
Thursday's talks were the Women's Coalition Party, the Alliance
Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.

The legislation, which is added to an agricultural spending
bill, would license such sales so long as they are not subsidized

The measure, passed by a voice vote in a subcommittee of the

advisors on the latest development in Sierra Leone, where four U.N.
peacekeepers were feared killed and eight others wounded in a
clash with rebels, to see "what further action we will take" to
get a quick release of some 50 U.N. staff being held in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who just returned from his Africa tour on Thursday
morning, made the remarks as he was entering the U.N. Headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I am now going to meet my senior advisors and we're going to
discuss ... the latest information and then determine what further
action we'll take," he said. "In the mean time, I've been on the
phone with several heads of state, and we are trying to strengthen
the force and bring it back."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will take steps to bring back those people
who are either being taken hostage or unaccounted for, he said.

Greece Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
The content of the agreement was discussed extensively during
Chrysochoidis' visit to Washington last year, as well as during a
series of recent meetings between him and Burns.
</P>
<P>
For years, Washington has voiced its dissatisfaction with
Greece for its failure to handle the terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an annual report published by the U.S. State Department
Monday, Washington complained that Greek terrorists last year
perpetrated 20 acts of violence against concerns of the U.S.
government and U.S. private companies in Greece and dramatically
increased their attacks against Greek targets, as well as foreign
targets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accused Athens of not having a strong public leading
government position and initiatives to improve the capabilities
and morale of the police to take actions against terrorists, but
Athens has rejected the U.S. accusation, saying that such an
accusation was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Athens newspaper "To Vima" Thursday,
Chrysochoidis responded negatively to the U.S. demand to change
Greece's existing legislative framework on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the Greek government did not want to
change the country's legislative framework on terrorism, and no "
task force" would be established.

<HEADLINE> Annan Meets Senior Advisors on Sierra Leone (Updated with more quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday afternoon began a discussion with his senior
advisors on the latest development in Sierra Leone, where four U.N.
peacekeepers were feared killed and eight others wounded in a
clash with rebels, to see "what further action we can take" to get
a quick release of some 50 U.N. staff being held in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who just returned from his Africa tour on Thursday
morning, made the remarks as he was entering the U.N. Headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I am now going to meet my senior advisors; we're going to
discuss and assess the latest information and then determine what
further action we can take," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the mean time, I've been on the phone with several heads of
state, and we are trying to strengthen the force and bring it back
to strength as quickly as we can whilst we take steps to free our
people who have either been taken hostage or are unaccounted for,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement as the U.N. Security Council is
scheduled to meet here on Thursday afternoon to discuss a draft
presidential statement on Sierra Leone, and the 15-nation body is
expected to again condemn the violence against U.N. peacekeepers
in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting will begin after the United Nations
lowered death toll from seven to probably four in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a press conference here
Thursday that eight were wounded and no bodies had been recovered
yet as the United Nations was not in control of the area where
four days of clashes with rebels from the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
But she said the number of captives U.N. peacekeepers,
including soldiers, military observers and civilians had now
jumped from 50 to at least 69.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, a 23-man unit of an armed Indian battalion
was reportedly surrounded by the RUF fighters in Kuiva near
Kailahun in east Sierra Leone, she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in Sierra Lone, called UNAMSIL, lost contact
with some other units, perhaps as many as 100 personnel, she said.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, the U.N. under-secretary-general for
peacekeeping operations, told a closed-door Security Council
meeting Wednesday that a total of seven peacekeepers had been
killed in clashes. Okabe said the numbers could fluctuate again.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL was deployed in April to monitor a peace accord signed
by the Government and rebels in July last year, including the
disarmament and demobilization of an estimated 45,000 fighters
ahead of elections planned for early next year.
</P>
<P>
The international community is making great efforts to get the
detainees released. The Nigerian president has sent his national
adviser Wednesday to Sierra Leone while the president of Mali, who
is head of the Economic Community of the West African States (
ECOWAS), is sending in his foreign minister and "there may be a
summit meeting put pressure on," Annan said.

<P>
The presidents signed the agreement that includes a plan of
action to execute projects on the issues of infrastructure,
environment and commerce," said Venezuelan Ambassador Fernando
Gerbasi.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that these projects will be studied by the
planning offices of the two countries and will have the technical
and financial backing of the Andean Development Corporation (CAF).
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs attending the presidential meeting in Bogota
agreed to meet every three months to examine the problems that
reduced last year's trade flow by almost 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
"However, Colombia-Venezuela trade registered in the first four
months of this year a 34 percent increase compared to the same
period of 1999, with a trade surplus for Colombia," said Ambassado
Gerbasi.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto said
that the main achievement of the meeting was the reactivation of
the integration commissions and the negotiation of pending matters,
led by the delimitation of marine and submarine areas.
</P>
<P>
"This step will permit the implementation of programs in
education, commercial, energy, environment, and infrastructure
matters that had been postponed," explained Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
President Hugo Chavez pledged his support and collaboration
with the peace process being carried out by President Pastrana
with the guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became tense last year when
Chavez said that he was ready to meet with the Colombian rebels,
which was criticized by the Pastrana government.
</P>
<P>
Colombian government has started peace talks with the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and started contacts
with the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the biggest guerrilla organization in Colombia, and
the ELN the second.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeking Ways to Strengthen U.N. Force in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it was considering ways to support the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone but would not prepare to send
ground troops there after rebels have killed U.N. soldiers there.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to consider ways to support the U.N. and make
sure the U.N. out there can do its job," said State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said that Sierra Leone's rebel force, the Revolutionary
United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, had violated a peace deal
signed in Togo last July by killing four U.N. soldiers and taking
69 hostage since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was consulting other countries on the
possibility of deploying a reaction force, but no request had been
suggested for U.S. ground force.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate one. We're not considering one, nor would
we thing one is necessary," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Boucher also said that Washington would discuss with the United
Nations how to make the international effort as effective as
possible, but would not elaborate on it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's going to be numbers, equipment,
capabilities, what. At this point, I can't say," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, a spokesman for the U.N. force in Freetown
said the Sankoh-led rebels were responsible for the killing and
the hostage seizures and would definitely be prosecuted. And
Boucher disclosed that the United States was gathering data, which
would be used in a trial.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Wins Big Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has won a further debt relief
 totaling 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, according to a press release
from the World Bank available here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed
on Tuesday that Uganda was eligible for debt relief under the
enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was forgiven 650 million dollars debt under the original
HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has made substantial progress in implementing economic
reforms and poverty reduction, said the release.
</P>
<P>
It said the international community recognized that Uganda's
poverty reduction strategy will contribute to continued economic
growth and improvement in the quality of life of the poor.
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, Uganda's inflation came down to 5.3
percent from 16.1 percent, and overall fiscal deficit fell to 5.6
percent from 11. 2 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the IMF launched the HIPC Initiative in 1996
as the first comprehensive effort to eliminate debt of the
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, the international community improved the terms
of HIPC program to take account of complaints that the original
plan offered too little help to poor debtor nations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces New Money for Charter Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday announced 16 million U.S. dollars in new money and the
continuation of 121 million dollars in previously awarded grants
for charter schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement when he visited the pioneer City
Academy in St. Paul to tout the popularity and success of charter
schools. The school is stop No. 3 on a two-day tour of education
success stories in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
"I want all of America to know about you, and through you
understand what might be done in other communities," Clinton said
during the visit. "You proved charter schools are a good idea."
</P>
<P>
Charter schools, a popular type of education reform, are
publicly financed and operate outside the authority of local
school districts and free from many union work rules.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said public charter schools expanded from one at his
election in 1992 to roughly 1,700 today. He admitted not all
charter schools are the best, but pinned part of the blame for
dysfunctional schools on "loose" state rules that allow them to "
stay open and become like another bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
He also said the Education Department will develop national
guidelines for participation by businesses and religious
organizations in charter schools.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's term, federal money for charter schools grew
to about 400 million dollars. Schools may use the money for
planning, organization and start-up costs.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Thursday with the Down Jones industrial average falling on slowing
productivity. But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow fell 67.01 at 10,413.12. The
blue chip index lost 250.99 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq index rose 12.
93 at 3,720.24, trimming its loss of 78.14 points in the previous
session and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 5.53 at 1,409.57.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as the Labor Department reported that
Americans' productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in
the first quarter, less than 3.5 percent in expectations. The
sharp slowdown from a 6.9 percent increase in the previous quarter
will give the Federal Reserve another reason to raise interest
rates because productivity is no longer rising enough to make up
for rising wages and price pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Federal reserve has raised rates five times since last June
in an effort to keep inflation at bay. Investors feared that the
Federal Reserve would raise as mush as a half-percentage point
instead of a quarter-percentage point expected previously due to
the sharp drop in productivity.
</P>
<P>
But The Nasdaq composite rose despite the productivity's
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.44 at 631.47. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 6.65 at 921.05 and the Russell 2000 index of

LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A new wing at the National Portrait
Gallery, which traces British history from Tudors to the Rolling
Stones, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The extension to the gallery, in Trafalgar Square, London, cost
16 million pounds (25.6 million U.S. dollars) .
</P>
<P>
Visitors arriving at the gallery are carried by the UK's
biggest overground escalator to the start of the display, to see
the oldest portraits, painted around 500 ago.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the gallery extension open, the Queen said she was
pleased that the new Tudor Gallery had been created to display
portraits of her predecessors, including the "Ditchley" painting
of Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
More recent sitters include Lady Thatcher, Arthur Scargill,
Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The gallery is the largest of its kind in the world, and even
before the new wing was added was attracting around one million
visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
The new wing was built on a former service yard belonging to

<HEADLINE> Livingstone Set to Be London Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ken Livingstone, the independent
candidate and Labour maverick, is set to win London's first
mayoral election, according to a BBC voter poll on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone, 54, who was expelled from Tony Blair's Labour
Party when he chose to go-it-alone to become mayor, would win at
least 41 percent of Thursday's ballot, said the poll, based on a
survey of 1,000 Londoners after they voted.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Conservative Party's candidate Steve Norris was
a clear second on about 30 percent and Labour's candidate,former
Health Secretary Frank Dobson, was trailing badly in third place
in the field of 11.
</P>
<P>
With about 150 local government results declared, the
Conservative vote was up 10 percentage points from 1996 when the
mainly town council seats were last contested.
</P>
<P>
The Labour vote was down 15 points, setting the stage for the
loss of hundreds of seats.
</P>
<P>
Blair still enjoys a huge parliamentary majority and is a good
20 points ahead of the Conservatives in national opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Voting has also been taking place to elect 3,000 councilors
across England but the spotlight is on London, where the first
race for a directly-elected mayor could be an embarrassment for
the government.
</P>
<P>
The capital has also been voting for a new Greater London
Assembly (GLA).
</P>
<P>
In the local authority elections, nearly 10,000 candidates are
battling for seats in 152 councils polls.
</P>
<P>
Although Thursday is official polling day, a number of
authorities opened polling stations early as part of an experiment
aimed at encouraging more people to use their votes.
</P>
<P>
But early indications in the London elections were that the
turnout could be about 33 percent, average for local authority
polls but low considering the publicity surrounding the mayoral
contest.
</P>
<P>
The eventual winner of the mayoral contest will hold the
largest personal mandate of any politician in the UK.
</P>
<P>
London's mayor and the 25-seat GLA will first take office in
Marsham Street, close to the Houses of Parliament in central
London before eventually moving to a new building near Tower
Bridge.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture Capital Investments Soar in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital investments in U.
S. entrepreneurial companies soared to record levels in the first
quarter of 2000, according to a report released Thursday by the
National Venture Capital Association of the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months, venture capitalists invested 22.
7 billion U.S. dollars into companies, compared to 6.2 billion
dollars in the first quarter of 1999, representing a 266 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies receiving venture-backed financing also
increase dramatically. In the first quarter, 1,557 companies
received financing, compared to only 851 companies a year ago.
</P>
<P>
There has been little change over the past year as to the
industries that are attracting the most venture capital
investments, the report said. Computer-related and communications
remain the most attractive industries, with computer-related
companies receiving 12.4 billion dollars and communications
companies receiving 6 billion dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the Internet-related investments category, there has been a
slight shift in areas of interest. Whereas Internet-related
services attracted the most interest a year ago, business-to-
business Internet related investments attracted the most interest
in the first quarter of 2000. Overall, Internet-related companies
which provide content, e-commerce, hardware or services to the
Internet economy attracted more investments than any other sector,
receiving a total of 17 billion dollars in the first quarter.
</P>

Almost 43 percent of the venture capital investments in the
first quarter, totaling 9.69 billion dollars, went to California,
where the Silicon Valley is located.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday adopted a presidential statement, voicing its strongest
condemnation of "the armed attacks perpetrated by the
Revolutionary United Front" against the U.N. peacekeepers in
Sierra Leone, and their "continued detention of a large number of
United Nations and other international personnel."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the
outbreak of violence in Sierra Leone in recent days," the
statement said. "It condemns in the strongest terms the armed
attacks perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
against the forces of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (
UNAMSIL), and their continued detention of a large number of
United Nations and other international personnel."
</P>
<P>
"The Council expresses its outrage at the killing of a number
of United Nations peacekeepers of the Kenyan battalion and its
deep concern for the UNAMSIL troops who have been wounded or
remain unaccounted for," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for May, Wang Yingfan of
China, presided over the open Security Council meeting, attended
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The open Council meeting
came after the closed-door consultation on the draft statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands that the RUF end its hostile
actions, release immediately and unharmed all detained United
Nations and other international personnel, cooperating in
establishing the whereabouts of those unaccounted for, and comply
fully with the terms of the Lome Peace Agreement," signed by the
Sierra Leonean Government and rebels in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council considers Mr. Foday Sankoh, as leader of
RUF, to be responsible for these actions, which are unacceptable
and in clear violation of their obligation under the Lome
Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council condemns the fact that Mr. Sankoh has
deliberately failed to fulfill his responsibility to cooperate
with UNAMSIL in bringing these incidents to an end," the statement
said. "The Council believes that he must be held accountable,
together with the perpetrators, for their actions."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council commands UNAMSIL forces and the Force
Commander for the courage, resolve and sacrifice they have shown
in attempting to bring this situation under control," the
statement said. "It expresses its full support for their continued
efforts to this end, and for the overall fulfilment of their
mandate."

<HEADLINE> 453 Million US Dollars Planned to Help Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An international donors' conference
organized by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the
Mozambique government ended Thursday with a pledge to issue almost
453 million dollars over the next few months, much more than the
Maputo government initially requested to meet the cost of
reconstruction after disastrous flooding.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Undersecretary Rino Serri said that the success
of the conference lay in "the great ability with which Mozambique
presented itself to the conference, with rigorous analyses and
very serious and well- founded proposals."
</P>
<P>
Serri recalled that Mozambique had seen economic recovery in
the '90s after a bloody civil war. It was therefore necessary now
to ensure "a rapid resumption of this positive course", without
neglecting other areas of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Among the innovative aspects of the conference, Serri cited its
attention for defending the land from the risks of nuclear war.
Mozambique made specific requests in this area and the donors,
including Italy, said they would meet them.
</P>
<P>
As for the debt problem, Italy will propose to the Group of
Eight to "accelerate the procedures" to cancel all of Mozambique's
debts, Serri said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambique government, of the over two million
hit by the flooding in five provinces, over 640 died and 400,000
were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
In the immediate future over half a million need to be re-
housed in safer areas, giving them access to land and the basic
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries, whose post-
colonial economic recovery was further hindered by a lengthy civil
war funded and encouraged by the then apartheid government in
South Africa.
