<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- French troops stationed in the
Central African Republic's capital, Bangui, evacuated 28 French
expatriates, mostly children, on Tuesday to neighboring Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The French forces stepped in after a scheduled Air France
flight was cancelled and took the French nationals to Libreville,
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said today.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the French community in Bangui remained
calm under the difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Backed by French helicopters, African soldiers serving in the
Inter-African Mission of Supervision of the Bangui Accords (MISAB)
shelled rebel positions in Bangui on Tuesday, forcing thousands of
people to flee.
</P>
<P>
Bangui is in the grip of its third rebellion within a year by
soldiers opposing President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
France has deployed an extra 1,600 soldiers in the Central
African Republic under a defense accord to assure the security of
European citizens and to keep President Ange-Felix Patasse in
power.

<HEADLINE> Owner of Collapsed Cairo Building Imprisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian High Security Court
today meted out a seven-year prison term for the owner of a
building that crumbled in a Cairo suburb last year in the
country's worst tragedy of the type.
</P>
<P>
Raouf Wissa Ibrahim, 60, was convicted of manslaughter for
illegally heightening the eight-story building that fell down
under its added weight.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 64 were killed after the ill-fated building caved in
like the folds of an accordion on its occupants on October 28.
</P>
<P>
Two engineers in charge of constructing the 25-year-old
building in Heliopolis district were sentenced to three years in
prison, with a fine of 325,396 Egyptian pounds (95,000
U.S. dollars) for negligence.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, where sloppy building work and adding extra floors are
common practices, has since toughened penalties on landlords who
cause death or injury by breaking building regulations.
</P>
<P>
In a decree issued last November, Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri
set a minimum of five years in jail for anyone caught constructing
or renovating a building without a license.
</P>
<P>
If anyone is killed or if three people are injured when an
illegal building collapses, the perpetrators face up to 10 years
in jail with hard labor, the decree said.

<HEADLINE> 100 Muslim Rebels Killed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 rebels of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) have been killed during their ongoing
armed conflicts with government troops in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, the military said today.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing paper, Armed Forces' Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo
Acedera said that the military intelligence force reported the
MILF forces suffered 100 casualties during the clashes which
started June 17.
</P>
<P>
But Acedera said that, so far, only 30 bodies of MILF fighters
had been retrieved by the military. MILF fighters usually drag
along their comrades slain during gun battles.
</P>
<P>
Five government soldiers were also killed in the fierce battles
which are now continuing in Pikit town in North Cotabato province
and Sultan Sa Barongis town in Maguindanao province, according to
the military chief.
</P>
<P>
As of 4:00 p.m. Tuesday, there was an on-going firefight
between the MILF and government forces in Pikit but there was no
report yet of any casualty.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, the fiercest so far this year, were triggered off
by a massive hostage-taking incident by the MILF guerrillas last
week.
</P>
<P>
On June 16, 43 employees of the National Oil Company were
seized hostage by the MILF elements in Maguindanao, but they were
successfully rescued by the military the following day.
</P>
<P>
Following the kidnapping incident, the military used land, air
and sea forces to strike the MILF rebels who have been long
suspected as involved in many kidnap-for-ransom activities in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
At least four brigades are now conducting operations against
the MILF in central Mindanao, said Acedera, adding that about
2,000 of the estimated 9,000 MILF members are involved in current
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa stressed that the
military will continue its current offensive against the MILF
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF leadership, which has bluntly dismissed the
government's charge that MILF rebels were kidnappers, earlier
warned that the MILF would pull out of the initial peace talks
with the government if the current military offensive continued.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has forced at least 30,000 residents to abandon
their homes in the conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the former larger Muslim
rebel group -- the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which
has already signed a peace deal with the government to end its
nearly 30 years of separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which refused to be included in the peace deal, began
its own peace talks with the government in January this year,
which have been on-and-off due to sporadic clashes between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and another smaller rebel group, Abu Sayyaf, are the
remaining two Muslim forces fighting the government. The MILF is
currently the largest anti-government force in the country, with
an estimated 10,000 armed members.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Record-High Payment Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines registered a
record-high payment surplus of 570 million U.S. dollars during the
first quarter this year, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying that
the record performance was a result of huge capital inflows which
more than offset the deficit in the country's current account.
</P>
<P>
The current account resulted in an actual deficit of 1.1
billion dollars, or 22 percent higher than the year-ago level of
923 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But he explained that the transfer account eventually recorded
a surplus of 200 million dollars, or a growth of 16.3 percent from
the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the surplus for the service account,
including remittances from overseas Filipino workers and
tourism-related services, netted 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the country's gross official foreign reserves
stood at 11.9 billion dollars as of March 1997, which is
equivalent to 3.1 months of imports of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Euro Row Unleashed within German Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A row over Europe's planned single
currency erupted today in Germany, with leaders in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition trading public accusations.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister of the southern German state of Bavaria,
Edmund Stoiber, sparked the row when he pledged "fierce
resistance" to any attempt by Kohl to soften the membership
criteria for the single currency to allow it to be launched on
time on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Stoiber said in the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
that his Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, would not tolerate any softening of the
strict budgetary benchmark required for qualification for the new
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Kohl for not being assertive enough on the
strict adherence to the Euro criteria.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Stoiber's remarks, Wolfgang Gerhardt, leader of
Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in Kohl's three-party
ruling coalition, accused Stoiber of using the objection to the
punctual start of the Euro to win popularity, apparently with an
eye on next year's state elections in Bavaria.

<HEADLINE> US Orders for Durable Goods Decline in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Orders for durable goods in the
U.S. declined by 0.6 percent in May, the second drop of this year,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that orders for durable goods, items expected
to last for three or more years, dropped to a seasonally adjusted
176.1 billion dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
That followed a 1.8 percent increase in April and a 2.8 percent
drop in March.
</P>
<P>
May's drop in new orders was widespread except for a strong
10.4 increase in electronic equipment led by demand for electronic
components and communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders fell 3.3 percent with declines in motor
vehicles and aircraft. Orders for primary metals such as steel
decreased 2.4 percent and for industrial machinery 1 percent.
Orders for military goods plunged 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
declined by 1.2 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted 176.3
billion dollars after a gain of 1.3 percent in April and 0.8
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
In line with the easing pressure, the backlog of unfilled
orders for durable goods was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted
496.5 billion dollars in May, after falling in both April and
March.
</P>
<P>
The report is further evidence that U.S. economic growth slowed
sharply in the second quarter after soaring at a 5.8 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, the fastest in nearly a decade.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Unveils Plan for Disarming N. Irish Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today unveiled an Anglo-Irish proposal for disarming guerrillas in
Northern Ireland in hopes of putting new life into the stalled
peace process in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all the parties to look at the proposals in a
constructive spirit. I really do not believe there is another way
forward," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament, Blair detailed his plan to achieve
a permanent peace in Northern Ireland, which includes setting up
an independent commission to oversee disarmament in parallel with
talks on a lasting political settlement, which Blair hoped to
start in earnest by early September at the latest and conclude by
next May.
</P>
<P>
The key point was that the anti-British Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and its rival Protestant guerrillas would give up their arms
in stages while talks proceeded.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to
rethink its policies and take positive steps to join the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"The time is limited, the settlement train is leaving, with or
without Sinn Fein. If they want to join, it is absolutely clear
what they have to do. I have dealt straight with them. I expect
straight dealing in return. We and the other parties will not be
waiting around for them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been excluded from the multi-party peace talks on
the Northern Ireland future because IRA resisted to call a
ceasefire. Sinn Fein quit a 17-month truce in February 1996 and
resumed military campaign to end the British rule in the Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair said an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire the IRA
broke early last year was needed to win a seat at the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The British government broke with official contacts with Sinn
Fein last week after two police officers were gunned down while on
their routine patrol by IRA guerrillas.

LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland police said today
they had charged a man with killing two officers who were shot in
Lurgan early last week.
</P>
<P>
"A 29 year old man has been charged with murder, two counts,"
local press quoted a security source as saying. The man was
detained on Tuesday and was due to appear later in the afternoon
at Craigavon magistrates court.
</P>
<P>
Two police were gunned down in close range in an IRA guerrilla
ambush last week while on a routine patrol. The murder has angered
the British government which cut off official contacts with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been fighting against the British rule of Northern
Ireland over the past 28 years, and more than 3,000 people have
died as a result of the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Says France Backs Intervention in Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today pledged support to the sending of an African intervention
force in the Congo Republic, but said French troops will only
provide technical support.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after a meeting with Senegalese
President Abdou Diouf and President Henri Konan Bedie of Cote
d'Ivoire, who suggested sending the force.
</P>
<P>
"France is surely favorable to all cooperation with the
African states, with the African chief of states for what concerns
the organization of the security. It (France) is ready to
cooperate as they hope and as they ask," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on between forces supporting Congolese
President Pascal Lissouba and "Cobras" militiamen of former
President Denis Sassou-N'Guesso since June 5, in which 1,000 to
3,000 people, most of them civilians, were estimated to have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
"We have done what was necessary to safeguard the life of the
victims of these events and we hope that, in all the situation of
crisis, an inter-African force, under the control of the OAU
(Organization of African Unity) and the countries concerned, could
take the necessary initiatives," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "France, without any doubt, will associate not
by joining the force itself, but with technical aid and support to
this force."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is deeply
committed to having the 2004 Olympic Games held in Cape Town
since sports are a great force for unity and reconciliation,
President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
"If we are nominated to stage the Olympic Games of 2004, we
can assure you that it will be an African Olympics, and an event
of which the entire world will be very proud," Mandela said while
accepting the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Award in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The award, named after the founder of the Modern OLympic
Movement, was conferred by International Olympic Committee (IOC)
member Louis Guirandou N'diaye, who is Acting President of the
International Committee for Fair Play.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that Africa had been in the forefront of the
fight against apartheid, adding that many of its potential
medalists withdrew from the 1976 Olympics in protest against
racial oppression in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the road towards 2004 will accelerate the
healing and reconstruction process, not only in South Africa but
on the entire (African) continent," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Law on Organ Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- German parliament today voted 422 to
213 to legalize the current practice in Germany that family
members can decide whether to donate organs of a deceased person
or not for transplanting.
</P>
<P>
The parliament rejected the bill proposing that the removal of
organs must get the donor's signed agreement before his or her
death.
</P>
<P>
This issue had been the focus in the debate which had divided
all factions in the parliament. Party leaders told deputies to
vote according to their conscience instead of any party line.
</P>
<P>
Among those voting for the passed law were Health Minister
Horst Seehofer, and leader of the main opposition Social Democrats
(SPD), Rudolf Scharping, and those voting for the stricter bill
that lost included Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig and
most of opposition Greens Party deputies.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the passed law noted that of the 3,228 organ
transplants in German hospitals in 1996, only 34 cases used organs
which people had pledged before their death.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, people can also expressly forbid any organs
to be removed from their bodies after their death.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation also allows doctors to remove organs from
people who, at a minimum, have been declared to be brain-dead by
two doctors, neither of whom is involved in organ transplants.
Some deputies had proposed to allow removal of organs from
brain-dead people but had wanted to bar such people from being
legally declared dead.

<HEADLINE> PLO Slams Israel for Current Middle East Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tension prevailing in the Middle
East is the result of the provocative policies of the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Palestinian
ambassador to Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh.
</P>
<P>
Ali Halimeh said in a statement today that the Israeli
administration was responsible for the collapse of the
negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO )
and the government of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to the entire world that Prime Minister Netanyahu
is not interested in a political settlement with the
Palestinians, and he himself is to blame for the deteriorating
situation in the area," said Halimeh.
</P>
<P>
"The tension which is prevailing in the Middle East is a
result of the persistent policies of Netanyahu, policies which
rejects basic principles of the Madrid peace conference and the
Oslo declaration of principles and the signed agreement between
the previous government and the PLO," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel had since its formation embarked on a campaign
to destabilize the Palestinian self-ruled territories through
economic blockades, security establishment and encouraging
violence.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian people were determined to continue to
fight until they achieved their objectives.

<HEADLINE> All Set for Direct Talks on Cyprus Issue: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said everything is
ready for the holding of Cypriot bi-communal direct talks near New
York next month, but expecting no "magic thing" out of them soon.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters after meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides, U.N. resident representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel
confirmed that leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities in
Cyprus will be attending the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has received a
verbal confirmation from Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of their
attendance of the talks scheduled between July 9 to 13.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said that "when I visited both leaders to give the
letter from the Secretary-General, I was told by both orally they
were going to be there. So, we are not waiting for any
reply. Everything is ready. There is nothing outstanding."
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming U.N.-sponsored direct talks between Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Dankash are aimed at hammering out
a comprehensive solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Feissel provided Clerides with further
"logistical information" on the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy refrained from speculating about the outcome of
the talks, saying that "one should not expect some magic thing
coming out of this first meeting."
</P>
<P>
Feissel said that the international community expects both
sides to proceed to the direct negotiations with a very serious
intent and to make a real concrete contribution toward a
comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official pointed out that although representatives of
the parties involved will be closely monitoring the talks from
nearby, the meeting will be "strictly between the two sides and
the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish
Cypriot north after the Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> EU-Japan Summit Ends, Trade Surplus Dialogue Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan agreed to step up its
dialogue with the European Union on curbing the trade imbalance
and further opening some of its market as the annual EU-Japan
summit ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The half-day meeting, which brought together Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, European Commission President Jacques
Santer and Dutch Prime Minister and current EU rotating president
Wim Kok, is the sixth since the two sides met for their first
Summit of this kind in 1991, when they signed the EU-Japan Joint
Declaration in this Dutch capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Kok
said the two sides had agreed to continue and step up the dialogue
on Japan's deregulation program, designed to curb its trade
surplus with Europe and encourage European investment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan also agreed to recognize the quality testing of European
medical equipment from September 1 this year, thus exempting EU's
medical devices from inspection in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The present relationship between the Union and Japan can be
characterized by the words of dialogue, cooperation and
partnership," he said, "There is a strong determination from both
sides for further deepening this relationship," Kok said.
</P>
<P>
Kok described the summit as valuable and encouraging, saying it
has laid the basis for further cooperation between EU and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Also describing the meeting as "meaningful", the Japanese Prime
Minister said that the two sides were now resolving pending issues
"one by one through cool-headed discussions".
</P>
<P>
Expressing understanding for EU's concerns for the sharp
increase of Japan's trade surplus with EU during the first five
months this year, Hashimoto said that he believed it would be
temporary and that he believed it would not increase in middle and
long terms.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to accelerate talks in economic issue, both
sides have stressed at the meeting that much more attention should
be put on their political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that Japan-EU relationship should be further
strengthened to ensure the economic weight of the two leads to
also responsibility being taken for political talks.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The second ordinary session
of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of Somalia opened
here today, seeking ways of bringing final peace to the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the second session, NSC current chairman Ali Mahdi
Mohamed said Somalia is definitely in a better condition now than
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
He added that in accordance with the Sodere agreement reached
at the first session, the Executive Committee of the NSC has
appointed two co-chairmen to enter dialogue with Hussein Mohamed
Aideed for peace in Mogadishu and to convince him to join the
peace process spearheaded by the National Salvation Council.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this mandated mission, peace agreements have
been concluded in Sanaa, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt," he said, adding
that "since those agreements, peace has returned to Mogadishu and
the relation between the National Salvation Council and Hussein
Aideed faction has been improving steadily."
</P>
<P>
Mahdi told participants that Somalia as a whole is in relative
peace and stability today. However, he said that the fighting in
middle and lower Jubba regions is a sad occurrence that must be
stopped immediatedly and prevented.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the illegal occupation by Hussein Aideed against
the will of the native inhabitants and called for the withdrawal
of forces unconditionally from these regions.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said, "the Somali people yearned for peace, tranquility,
stability and restoration of their dignity as a nation beyond
petty clan differences, political bricking and insignificant
pickings."
</P>
<P>
He urged the fellow council members to put aside all
personal differences and act collectively for the common goal of
securing the welfare of the Somali people by rebuilding their
country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Ethiopian Vice-minister of Foreign
Affairs Tekeda Alemu assured his country's support to the Somali
peace process and said that Ethiopia will continue to do whatever
is necessary and within the limits of its capacity for the
realization of peace and national reconciliation in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Expects Saudi Crown Prince's Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said here today that the scheduled visit to Lebanon
by Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, will
help bring more investments from oil-rich Gulf states to this
country.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks in interviews with the Saudi Press
Agency and the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC)
television on the eve of Prince Abdullah's arrival in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit by a senior member of the Saudi
Arabian royalty since 1975.
</P>
<P>
"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia always stands on Lebanon's side
and supports it in all international and Arab occasions, and
contributed in all initiatives aimed at putting an end to the
Lebanese (1975-90) civil war," the Lebanese premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries with
which Lebanon enjoys a favorable balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the visit underlines the great strides
forward Lebanon has made in the way of stabilization,
development and reconstruction and this visit will open a door
before the Arab investors, especially those from the Gulf and
Saudi Arabia," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire-turned Lebanese prime minister, who is also a
close friend of the Saudi Arabian royalty, added that the
kingdom has financed a number of projects in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We thank Saudi Arabia for what it has provided for Lebanon,"
the premier underlined.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian crown prince, who is due to arrive in Beirut
from Damascus Thursday, heading a 140-member delegation, will
hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Minister of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fatchett today
reiterated his country's support for UAE's efforts to settle a
territorial dispute with Iran by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Britain has a firm stand of backing UAE's proposal for a
peaceful settlement of the Iran-UAE dispute over three islands
known as Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, the UAE's Wam
news agency quoted Fatchett as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with his UAE's counterpart
Sheikh Bin Zayed al-Nahyan. He arrived here Tuesday night for a
two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as part of his
Gulf tour.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said the issue should be settled either through
negotiations between the UAE and Iran or by referring it to the
International Court of Justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The islands are currently under Iran's rule, but are claimed
by the UAE. The UAE said the islands were occupied by Iran in
1981. The UAE has proposed to bring the dispute to the
International Court of Justice, but Iran has rejected the
bid.

ADDIS ABABA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa regional
administration has ordered illegal constructors to evacuate

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Two-phase U.N. Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today proposed a two-phase exit strategy for the withdrawal
of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern
Slavonia (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the pace of
the handover to Croatian control would be commensurable with
Croatia's performance in reassuring the Serb population and
peacefully reintegrating the region.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed first phase of withdrawal, the number of the
U.N. troops would be halved by mid-August from 5,000 to 2,530,
including 720 military support personnel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Transitional Administrator would also devolve
to Croatia executive responsibility for the major part of civil
administration of the region while maintaining his authority and
ability to intervene and overrule decisions should the situation
deteriorate and the achievements of UNTAES be threatened.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, and subject to satisfactory Croatian
performance, remaining executive functions would be devolved, with
Croatia resuming responsibility for the continued demilitarization
of the region and the gradual integration of the Transitional
Police Force into the Croatian authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Further reductions are planned for the period after September
in order to reach a level of 720 by October in the light of
developments of the country," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the essential prerequisite was the the full
cooperation of the Croatian government which bore the
responsibility of convincing the local population that
reintegration of the people of the region was sustainable and that
the process of reconciliation and return was irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Dayton peace accords, UNTAES was established to
oversee the reintegration of the heavily Serb-inhabited region of
Eastern Slavonia into Croatia.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Governor Warns on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, last night gave his strongest warning yet that
Europe's unemployment problem may make it dangerous to go ahead
with the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The move would be fraught with risk if some member countries
had not improved the flexibility of their job markets, the
governor told his audience at the City University Business School.
</P>
<P>
"I am frankly nervous at the prospect of introducing the euro
at a time of very high and very different rates of unemployment
across Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Governor warned that labor market reform must be an urgent
priority for European governments, saying "we have to find answers
to the urgent problem of European unemployment."
</P>
<P>
His warning came as the pound hit a five-year high. Observers
in the City said investors were continuing to transfer funds out
of the major European currencies and into "safe" currencies such
as sterling and the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We are not all starting from the same station", the Governor
said, before pointing out that "the possibility of such cyclical
divergences will not simply disappear on January 1, 1999, and they
would seriously complicate the operation of monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
Eddie George support the government's emphasis at the recent
Amsterdam summit on the use of supply-side reforms to boost
employment. But he added that there was not yet consensus in
Europe on specific measures.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to be able to hold on to macroeconomic stability -
as we must - then we have to find answers to the urgent problem of
European unemployment," the Governor said.
</P>
<P>
But stable macroeconomic policies were not enough, as
illustrated by the fact that output had stagnated and unemployment
risen inexorably, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Governor conceded that unemployment in Europe - which
averages more than one in 10 of the workforce - was probably
aggravated by the "heroic attempts being made to meet the fiscal
criteria according to the Maastricht criteria in a context of
cyclical weakness".

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Up Sharply in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned homes
in the U.S. jumped by 4.4 percent in May to the highest level this
year, the U.S. National Association of Realtors reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that single-family homes sold at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.24 million in May, up from 4.06 million
in April. That was just 0.9 percent under the record 4.28 million
sales rate of May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales rose 8.2 percent in the South to a rate of
1.46 million and 5.9 percent in the Midwest to 1.07 million. Sales
in the West were unchanged at a rate of 930,000. They edged 1.5
percent lower in the Northeast to 660,000.
</P>
<P>
"We expect fairly stable sales for the balance of the year,"
said the association's president, Russell Booth. That would bring
sales in at about the 18-year high of 4.09 million reached last
year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing sales of existing homes were supported by the
highest level of consumer confidence in nearly 30 years and the
lowest rate of unemployment in 24 years.

<HEADLINE> World Bank WDR Reports: Rethinking The State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today issued a
report asserting an "effective state" is the cornerstone of
successful economies, and without it, economic and social
development is impossible.
</P>
<P>
According to the 265-page World Development Report 1997: the
State in a Changing World, those countries which have concluded
that the role of the state should be less prominent, ought to
consider how the dazzling growth of East Asia, and even the
industrial revolution, were made possible by an "effective
state"--- one which harnesses the energy of private business and
individuals, and acts as their partner and catalyst, instead of
restricting their partnership.
</P>
<P>
The report underlined several key tasks for every government's
mission: establishing a foundation of law, maintaining an
effective macroeconomic policy environment, including capable
financial institutions, investing in basic social services and
infrastructure, providing a comprehensive safety net for
vulnerable members of society and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
A survey of entrepreneurs in 69 countries was used to gauge
government credibility and its impact on business. In general, it
shows a strong correlation between a country's credibility rating
and its record of growth and private investment.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the survey reveals that many countries lack the
basic institutional foundations for markets to grow. High levels
of crime and personal violence and an unpredictable judiciary
combine to produce what the report defines as the "lawlessness
syndrome."
</P>
<P>
Cutting back on discretionary authority on the part of
government is essential, the WDR report stressed. Policies
that lower controls on foreign trade, remove entry barriers for
private industry, and privatize state firms in a way that ensures
competition will help fight corruption.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Worried over Angola's Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An official from the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) today
expressed worries over the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Isaias Samakuva, head of UNITA's delegation at the Joint
Commission of Angolan Peace Process, told the press in Bailundo,
central Angola, that the current situation in Angola was similar
to the one in 1992 when a civil war re-erupted in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
UNITA does not want to see Angola once again plunged into a
civil war, which would bring great losses to the people, Samakuva
said.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA official attributed the recent clashes between UNITA
army and government forces in the country's northeastern
diamond-mining area to government attacks, saying UNITA did not
launch an offensive.
</P>
<P>
The peace process requires a stable environment, said
Samakuva, who then called on all sides concerned to stop hostile
military operations and come back to the Lusaka Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process is presently caught in a stalemate
due to both disputes on the establishment of local
administrations and fights between government forces and UNITA
army in the diamond-mining areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today approved a 268.2 billion U.S. dollars
defense budget for the fiscal year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The defense bill, passed by the House on a bipartisan vote of
304-210, provides 285 million U.S. dollars to destroy Russia's
Cold War-era nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also voted for purchasing another nine B-2
bombers. Cohen was opposed to the purchase, arguing it is too
expensive and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The bill authorized 2.1 billion U.S. dollars as requested by
the White House for continued development of the Air Force's F-22
fighter. It also would spend 1.3 billion U.S. dollars for up to 12
F/A-18 E and F planes.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on a defense bill next month.
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate defense bills would spend 6.6 billion
U.S. dollars more than President Bill Clinton requested and are
three billion larger than the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The B-2 production start-up may not survive the legislative
process as the Senate version expressly bars purchase of
additional B-2 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Pentagon was unanimous in its view that "the
cost of further B-2 production cannot be justified."
</P>
<P>
But supporters argued the funds would help maintain productive
capacity of the defense industry and provide necessary fighting
capability.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Senior Officers to Stay in Defence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela has
urged senior South African National Defense Force (SANDF)
officers to stay in the force, saying the country's defense force
needed their invaluable skills and qualifications, said a source
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Presidential Aide Parks
Mankahlana said Mandela made the appeal at a meeting when he was
informed that 10 generals were planning to leave the force.
</P>
<P>
SANDF Head Georg Meiring, Defense Minister Joe Modise and Defense
Secretary Pierre Steyn, along with 80 members of SANDF's general
staff, attended the meeting at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the president wanted to discourage officers
from choosing retirement and emphasised the defense force still
needed their skills to carry out much needed transformation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also paid tribute to the defense force for the loyalty
shown thus far and noted it was not getting enough credit for the good
work it was doing, especially in assisting other arms of the security
forces, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Referring to defense budget cuts, Mandela said reducing expenditure
was not an indication of any decline in interest in maintaining a
viable military capacity. enditem

<HEADLINE> Americans Concerned about Children's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Americans express deep concern
over the moral and ethical development of the nation's children
and don't see parents as adequate role models.
</P>
<P>
A survey released Wednesday indicates 37 percent of the 2,000
people surveyed believe today's children will make the country a
better place once they're grown, The United Press International
reported from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The Kids These Days survey was conducted by Public Agenda for
Ronald McDonald House Charities and the Advertising Council.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were critical of both teenagers and young
children. Teens were described as rude, irresponsible and wild.
Younger children were described as lacking discipline and spoiled.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 percent said it is common for children to treat people
with respect.
</P>
<P>
Public Agenda Executive Director Deborah Wadsworth says,
"Americans are frightened for and in some cases frightened of our
children and fault parents for the problems they see."
</P>
<P>
Parents were criticized for being too willing to break up their
marriages instead of trying to stay together for the children.
</P>
<P>
The survey also queried children 12 to 17 years old. Nearly
half said they feel children their age need more guidance and
attention from adults. Only a third said they think their
generation will make the world a better place.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM-Designate Optimistic About New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister designate
Mesut Yilmaz today expressed optimism about the new government
that he is trying to form.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with President Suleyman Demirel, Yilmaz
told reporters that his contacts with several parties made him
believe that the new government would win a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, chairman of the second largest Motherland Party
(ANAP), made the remark after the Welfare Party (RP) and the True
Path Party (DYP) announced that they had enough votes to defeat
the proposed government in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan told a press
conference that the only thing that Yilmaz should do was to
return the mandate to the president, saying a RP-DYP alliance
with the Grand Unity Party (BBP) support would form a
parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, categorically rejected the RP-DYP
announcement, saying that he would form the new government at the
end of his talks with other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the developments in the coming days will
expand the margin. The outcome of the vote will not be very
close," the ANAP leader added.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as unfair that the RP and DYP leaders' allegation
that he was trying to recruit deputies from these parties, Yilmaz
said that deputies had right to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has reportedly briefed Demirel on the developments of
his work to set up a new government to replace the outgoing RP-DYP
administration.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he would go ahead with his program to form
a new government without making any direction changes, adding he
would not hold new talks with DYP leader Tansu Ciller unless she
changed her stance.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's three major opposition parties, which have more than
100 seats in the parliament, have expressed their support for the
new government to be formed by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, however, refused to discuss government issue with
Yilmaz on Tuesday during their 20-minute meeting, urging Yilmaz
to return the mandate to the president.
</P>
<P>
If the new government fails to win a vote of confidence in the
parliament, the mandate to form a government has to go to Ciller's
DYP, which is the third largest party in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Yilmaz has enjoyed 265 votes in the
parliament, not enough to survive a possible vote of confidence in
the 550-seat parliament with a vacancy of two.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, under pressure and criticism from the military and the
junior coalition partner DYP over his government's failure to curb
the rapidly expanding Islamic fundamentalism in the secular
country, resigned on June 18.

ATHENS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yugoslav Premier Radoje
Kontic today held talks with his Greek counterpart, Costis
Simitis, on bilateral relations, multilateral Balkan cooperation,
the reintegration of Yugoslavia into international organizations
and the peace procedures.
</P>
<P>
Kontic, who is on a one-day visit to Greece, described his
talks with Simitis as "sincere, friendly and constructive."
</P>
<P>
He said that trade between the two countries was projected in
the region of 500 million dollars for the next year. He thanked
Athens for helping reintegrate Yugoslavia and remove obstacles to
relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Greek prime minister had agreed in principle that Belgrade
could use the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Simitis said that Belgrade was supportive of
Athens' proposal to convene a summit of Balkan countries towards
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need of normalizing relations between Balkan
countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had to develop a Balkan policy and Greece
should play a leading role towards achieving this goal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Kontic also met with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos and Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis and
signed two bilateral agreements on the avoidance of double
taxation and investment protection.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to earn 85
million US Dollars from 260,000 bales of cotton to be exported to
the Far East in the 1997/98 period.
</P>
<P>
Ally Ngongolo, General Manager of Tanzania Cotton Lint and
Seed Board, told the official Daily News here today that the
260,000 bales will be part of the 300,000 bales to be bought from
farmers during the 1997/98 period, which starts next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 40,000 bales, said the general manager, would be
consumed by local industries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that cotton production this season (1997/98) was
36 percent lower than the previous season, when 469,000 bales were
bought.
</P>
<P>
Ngongolo attributed the drop in production mainly to prolonged
drought in major cotton growing areas from last October to March
this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> GCC Nearly Finishes Commodities Classification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states nearly finished the process of commodities
classification today in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, to pave
way for forging unified customs tariffs on foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Riyadh said that the GCC customs
committee finalized the classification of 34 commodities out of 70.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) quoted the reports as saying
the committee finalized, during its 11th meeting last Monday, the
classification of 312 commodities, after agreement by some states
who had objected earlier, bringing the agreed items to 94.5
percent of about 1,400 items on the generally accepted
international classification list.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization founded
in 1981, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs in the GCC states at present vary from 4
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A wide gap existed among the member states toward the
unification due to differences in each country's economic
priorities. The disagreement has blocked a tariffs agreement
almost since the alliance was formed.
</P>
<P>
The classification of goods falls into three categories,
including goods exempted from tariffs, basic goods with a tariff
of 4 to 8 percent or 8 to 12 percent, and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Differences on classifying the remaining 36 center on the
rate of customs to be imposed, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Financial and Economic Cooperation Committee decided
in its 45th meeting held in Doha, Qatar, last May that the
customs committee should classify all the unclassified
commodities, and the list of the newly-classified commodities
would be referred to the committee during its next meeting in
October.
</P>
<P>
The final authority deciding the issue would be the GCC heads
of state who will hold their annual summit in Kuwait in December.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the committee described the progress in
efforts to achieve the customs unification by the GCC states as
"a great success toward achieving a strong economic bloc in the
face of other international alliances."

LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Voters' registration for the July
19 presidential and parliamentary elections began today in Liberia,
after a day's delay by torrential rain and transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia and its environs, registration began at many
schools and public buildings around 7:00 a.m., with the west
African peace-keeping force providing security for hundreds of
queuing civilians, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force and the United Nations observers today
also started airlifting registrars assigned to remote areas, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
About one million Liberians above the age of 18 are eligible
for the poll, which will produce the future president, the
vice-president and 90 legislators.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 13 candidates have announced their intentions to
contest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the election will lead to final peace in
Liberia, after seven years of civil war that has killed over 200,000
people and left many others homeless.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Commander of the peacekeeping force Victor Malu
called on the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to lend a helping
hand to the refugees that have been voluntarily returning to
Liberia through various border posts.
</P>
<P>
The commander estimated that about 140,000 Liberians have returned
home in the last two months. He noted the refugees need help to settle
down in their war-devastated towns and villages.

<HEADLINE> World Bank OKs 830 Mln Dlr Loans for China's Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of two loans totaling 830 million U.S. dollars for
two projects in China, the last two in this fiscal year ending
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The first loan of 400 million dollars is earmarked for the
Waigaoqiao thermal power plant project near Shanghai. The project
will finance the building of two 900-1000 megawatt coal-fired
supercritical thermal thermal power units, installation of
flue-gas desulfurization equipment, i.e. to offset anticipated SO2
emissions at the plant. The project also includes the construction
of two 500 kilovolt power lines to connect electricity users to
the Shanghai power grid.
</P>
<P>
The other loan of 430 million dollars equivalent will be used
to finance Xiaolangdi multipurpose project II. The loan includes
230 million U.S. dollars and 346.5 million Deutsche marks.
</P>
<P>
The project will expand on massive flood protection,
hydropower, sediment control, and irrigation infrastructure work
which began in 1993. The project will finance the second

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition MPs Reject Budget Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition members of
parliament (MP) today continued to reject participation in the
on-going debate on the 1997/98 budget report.
</P>
<P>
They staged a mass walkout of the National Assembly on Tuesday
when Kenyan parliament started the seven-day debate on the budget
report made by Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs said that they would not take part in any
debate until their suit was heard and determined on Friday
otherwise the debate would prejudice the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The suit filed by seven Opposition MPs last Monday is aimed at
seeking to stop parliament from debating the budget report and
will be argued next Friday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the suit, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said
on Tuesday that parliament was supreme and cannot therefore be
taken to court.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Speaker Francis Ole Kaparo also noted that no authority
in the east African country had any power to interfere with the
business of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He termed the move taken by Opposition MPs as "the grossest
insult to the House, an abuse of privileges and a subversion of
the rules and powers of the House."
</P>
<P>
Velarie Onyango, Chief Litigation Counsel, told Kenyan High
Court on Tuesday that the chaos which rocked parliament last
Thursday were caused by Opposition leaders themselves and hence
"they should not take advantage of their own undoings to hold the
state at ransom."
</P>
<P>
She noted that parliament had operated under special powers
and privileges which barred courts of law from any kind of
interferences.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister Hage
Geingob today assured the nation that a proposed legislation to
regulate the country's intelligence is not aimed to harass the
public but protect them.
</P>
<P>
There are sufficient safeguards built into the Central
Intelligence Service Bill to avoid misuse of power by the state
agents, Geingob was quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told a press conference in Windhoek that
there will be no bugging of private telephones or interception of
mail unless permission for such acts is granted by a judge.
</P>
<P>
He said the intelligence bill has become necessary due to internal
threats such as instigation of ethnic strife, labour unrest, tax fraud
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
There are also external threats to Namibia posed by drug dealers,
arms smugglers and the illegal plundering of resources such as
diamonds and fish, he added.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Backs Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A constitutional amendment to
require that crime victims are notified and permitted to attend
court proceedings is the best way to protect their rights, U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno said today.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many victims in this country who feel like they
are left out of the system," Reno told the Judiciary Committee of
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses who appeared later criticized the proposed amendment,
saying that while the goal was worthy, the approach was
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
Proponents said that the Constitution includes at least 15
specific rights for defendants but none for crime victims, an
omission they contend allows the system to disregard victims and
their pain.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, victims would be told of court proceedings
and allowed to attend, permitted to make statements about a
release, plea bargain or sentence and be notified of a prisoner's
escape or release.
</P>
<P>
It also would grant victims the right to restitution and
require that their safety be considered before their assailants'
release.
</P>
<P>
Reno said an amendment ensuring these rights is the "best
means" to correct the "existing imbalance... between defendants'
constitutional rights and the current haphazard patchwork of
victims' rights."
</P>
<P>
Some 29 states have added victims' rights amendments to their
constitutions, but advocates of a federal amendment -- applicable
to state and federal court proceedings -- say state protections
aren't uniform and often are superseded by the defendant rights
outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Postpone Talks With Philippine Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Muslim rebel group
decided today to postpone its peace talks with the government
because of ongoing fierce conflicts between the two sides in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Al Hadj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), told the local television ABS-CBN by telephone that
his group decided to defer the next round of their initial peace
talks with the government in view of the current fighting.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF had planned to begin their sixth
round of exploratory peace talks in Maguindanao province in
western Mindanao on June 28 and 29 to discuss a general ceasefire
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But Murad, who is in charge of MILF military affairs, did not
say when the delayed peace talks will re-start.
</P>
<P>
MILF Vice Chairman Al Hadj Murad denied their men took some
100 passengers hostage, saying these civilians were just caught in
the cross fire between the soldiers and the MILF fighters.
</P>
<P>
Murad said his men stopped the buses just to prevent them from
going along the highway in North Cotabato province, central
Mindanao, where the MILF is going to lay landmines.
</P>
<P>
He also denied his men shot two passengers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gen. Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the Armed
Forces, made it clear that the military will continue its ongoing
offensives against the MILF rebels despite the rebels' threat to
pull out of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said there is "no letup in the military action until all
suspected kidnappers are flashed out of MILF camps."
</P>
<P>
The military chief said the military will continue its ground
and air attacks against the positions of the rebels to save the 40
hostages who remain in the hands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A special air force was sent to reinforce the government
troops fighting the MILF in North Cotabato province in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Today's conflict started at 5:30 a.m. when MILF rebels stopped
three buses along a highway in Kabacan and held hostage some 100
passengers.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour fierce battle, 60 hostages were rescued by
the military, who were backed by helicopter gunships. The battle
reportedly killed four soldiers, two civilians and one rebel.
</P>
<P>
A group of marine troops were deployed along the highway
linking North Cotabato and Davao province this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 47 rebels and at least five soldiers were
killed during the fierce clashes between the MILF and the military
in the past 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Serves as Starting Point for Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming return of Hong Kong
to China will inject a new impetus into the region's economic
development and become a new starting point for its prosperity,
according to an article in the latest issue of the Hong Kong and
Macao Economic Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the great impact of this historic event on Hong
Kong's economy, the article said, the transfer of power in Hong
Kong will dispel some people's worries and increase the confidence
of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" ensures that the key
factors contributing to the success of Hong Kong will stay in
future, and that Hong Kong residents will be able to govern Hong
Kong successfully.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the relations between the inland areas of China and
Hong Kong will be further increased and the "China factor" will
play an increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The inland areas have set the long-range economic objective
through the year 2010 and drawn up the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), which will provide more and greater development
opportunities for Hong Kong, the article said.
</P>
<P>
the International Monetary Fund predicted that the global
economy will grow rapidly during the 1997-2002 period. Asia will
be the region that will score the fastest growth in the world and
this is conducive to Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong will play a greater role as an
international trade center with the improvement of the global
trade environment, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, the growth of personal consumption and
investment in fixed assets will top the expected targets as a
result of the good impact of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of Hong Kong's economy is expected to reach 5.8
percent this year, despite a slow export growth in the first half
of the year, the article said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998-2002 period, the annual growth rate of Hong
Kong's gross domestic product is expected to increase from an
average of 5.4 percent in the previous five years to six percent,
it said.

Minister declared, adding that the Misuse of Drugs Act will be
amended before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed amendments, hard-core opiate addicts will be
prosecuted in court and if convicted, they will be given a
mandatory five to seven years jail term with three to six strokes
of the cane.
</P>
<P>
Any addict who has been through the five to seven years jail
term with caning and re-arrested for another opiate drug offense
will be liable for a longer seven to 13 years jail term plus six
to 12 strokes of the cane, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Although the new regime is targeted at opiate addicts, other
drug abusers are warned that the Government will not hesitate to
impose similar stern measures against them if the situation
warrants it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also said that though the drug situation in
Singapore is under control and the number of drug addicts arrested
since 1994 has declined, Ecstasy abuse has gone up to date and
more than 700 persons have been prosecuted for Ecstasy abuse since
the problem surfaced in late 1995.

ATHENS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today welcomed Hong Kong's handover on July 1, saying it
was an event of historic importance.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said in an interview with Xinhua that he believed Hong
Kong, as a significant world financial and economic center, would
continue to be prosperous and stable after the handover.
</P>
<P>
He said China had assured that the principles inscribed in

"We have noted China's assurances. We believe that these
principles guarantee the maintenance of stability, progress and
freedom for the people of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed China, whose reform and opening-up policy
has resulted in tremendous economic progress, would not change
its "one country, two systems" policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- It was dawn and most parts of
the city were still asleep, but thousands of news stands already
started a new day of business in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lee, an old man in his late 50s, was busy placing more than 20
kinds of just-arrived local newspapers onto his small stand near
the Southorn Playground in the downtown district of Wan Chai.
</P>
<P>
"With the handover coming nearer day by day, public concerns
about this big event are growing, and newspapers sell very well
these days," he said with a beaming face.
</P>
<P>
The streets became alive with vehicles and pedestrians after
the clock struck eight. Among the commuters scurrying past, many
are public servants who have been working for years in the tall
and magnificent buildings along the streets.
</P>
<P>
After the July 1 handover, all 180,000 members of the Hong Kong
civil service will retain their current jobs.
</P>
<P>
"It is a blessing for Hong Kong that the civil service can work
with contentment and a long-term plan," said Hui Kwok-hung, a
public servant.
</P>
<P>
"What I can do for the handover is to do a good job at my
current post," said Wong Kwong-chung, 48, of the Department of
Immigration.
</P>
<P>
With only five days to go before Hong Kong returns to China,
the 6.4 million local residents, while keeping to their normal way
of life, can easily perceive a growing atmosphere of celebration
and festivity when they take a walk in major shopping streets
after a day's work.
</P>
<P>
The glass walls of commercial and office buildings have been
newly decked out with tens of thousands of decorative lights.
</P>
<P>
They feature various kinds of patterns, such as bauhinia, a
flower representing Hong Kong, dragon heads, and Chinese
characters that read "Celebrate Handover '97."

When night falls, these lights start to rival the colorful
neons, adding splendor and a festive atmosphere to the skyline of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has never been prettier as it is now, when the
handover is arriving," exclaimed a couple of young lovers enjoying
the view on the Peak.
</P>
<P>
For a good observer, there are a lot of new spectacles to see
in the pre-handover Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Along the banks of the Victoria Harbor, nearly 100 commercial
and office buildings have started to hang the Five-Star Red Flag,
China's national flag, the regional flag of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (KKSAR) and banners marking the return of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some large shopping malls have set up special counters that
sell various kinds of handover souvenirs, including gold coins,
stamps, badges, handbags, toys and other articles.
</P>
<P>
Motorcades of the Hong Kong police force can occasionally be
seen roaring across town. They are rehearsing for the reception
and escort of dignitaries who will attend the Hong Kong handover
ceremony at midnight on June 30.
</P>
<P>
There are long queues in front of the mansion of the Department
of Immigration. Waiting patiently in the line are local citizens
applying for a HKSAR passport.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Immigration gave out more than 91,000
application forms on June 10, the first day for the issue of the
form.
</P>
<P>
There are visibly more visitors in the streets than before, who
are easily recognizable by the map they hold.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong has attracted nearly 10,000 journalists
and a large number of tourists from all over the world, and most
of the local hotels to date have been fully occupied.

<HEADLINE> MNLF Helps Military Fight MILF Rebels in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Another Muslim armed group was
dragged today into the ongoing conflicts between Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels and government troops in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM), today ordered the deployment of three battalions
of his Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) men in North Cotabato
to reinforce the government troops there.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, who is also chairman of the MNLF, said the troop will
help the government troops conduct mop-up operations against the
MILF in Kabacan town in North Cotabato, according to reports of
the local television ABS-CBN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 7,000 armed civilians organized by a private
organization vowed to attack the MILF if the rebel group continued
to launch offensives against the Moro people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is going on in Kabacan town between the
government troops and some 1,000 Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels who still held some 40 hostages as human shields.
</P>
<P>
Today's conflict started at 5:30 a.m. when MILF rebels stopped
three buses along a highway in Kabacan and held hostage some 100
passengers.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour fierce battle, 60 hostages were rescued by
the military. The battle reportedly killed four soldiers, two
civilians and one rebel.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF leadership denied their men took the civilians
hostage, saying those passengers were just caught in cross fire
between the soldiers and the MILF fighters.
</P>
<P>
The highway, linking North Cotabato and Davao province, was
reopened at noon after being closed for six hours due to the
fighting. But local buslines refused to run on the highway unless
the government guarantees their safety.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 47 rebels and at least five soldiers were
killed during the fierce clashes between the MILF and the military
in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF is a former major Muslim rebel group in the southern
Philippines, which signed a peace deal with the government last
September. The MILF, a breakaway group of the MNLF, refused to
accept the peace deal.

The governor said in a recent interview with Chinese reporters
stationed in Macao that Hong Kong's smooth return to its
motherland will help ensure a smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is doubtless that Hong Kong's successful transition has
increased confidence in Macao," he said. "It will be a factor
conducive to a smooth transition in the territory."

<P>
July 1 will be a very important day for China, he said, adding

<HEADLINE> Waigel Says Tax Reform Vital for German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today that the government's planned tax reform would help
boost the economy, employment and flagging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 tax reform plan involves cutting mainly income and
corporate tax levels, with total net tax cuts reaching 30 billion
marks (17.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The negative image of Germany as a high-tax country will
become invalid," Waigel told the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament dominated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right
coalition, which is expected to pass the tax bill today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bill would close a series of complex tax
loopholes to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said the tax reform plan would boost economic growth,
help reduce Germany's record unemployment which is now over 11
percent and reverse the fall in foreign investment over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
After being approved by the Bundestag, the bill will go to the
Bundesrat, the upper house, which is controlled by the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD). The SPD has vowed to
veto the reform plan.
</P>
<P>
Its finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier described as "crazy"
the government's plan to reduce the top marginal income tax rate
to 39 percent from the present 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the veto succeeds, the bill will be sent to a mediating
committee consisting of government and opposition members to
negotiate a compromise.

<HEADLINE> China Favors Gradual Ban on Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China favors banning
anti-personnnel landmines in a step by step manner, rather than an
immediate total ban, China's Ambassador to the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) Sha Zukang said today.
</P>
<P>
But he said China would not object to the appointment of a
special coordinator to try and launch negotiations on a global
landmines ban.
</P>
<P>
Sha said China believed the time was far from ripe for the
prohibition of such a small defensive weapons like anti-personnel
landmines. The CD should concentrate on arms control and
disarmament issues that have a significant impact on international
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
But Sha told the last meeting of the second 1997 session of the
United Nations-sponsored that, "Considering that the overwhelming
majority of CD members demand or are prepared to address the
landmine issue early, the Chinese delegation is willing to show
flexibility."
</P>
<P>
The forum today agreed to appoint a special coordinator who
will try to look into launching talks on banning the use, storage,
production and transfer of landmines.
</P>
<P>
The consensus decision, reached a day before the forum ends its
second session, was a breakthrough in the Geneva talks which have
been deadlocked all year due to a row between Western states eager
to negotiate global bans on landmines and the production of
bomb-making fissile material, and non-aligned states seeking
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Sha said China was not opposed to the objective of the
prohibition of anti-personnel landmines realized in a phased
approach, but could not agree to any immediate total ban.
</P>
<P>
Both humanitarian concerns and national security
interests should be taken into account when addressing the
landmine issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons remained an "indispensable, legitimate and
conventional means of national defense" for his vast country which
has long land borders and an "uncertain security environment", Sha
noted.

<HEADLINE> HK Return Encourages Macao's Return: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's coming return offers a
good example and a great encourage to the return of Macao, a top
Chinese official said here in Macao Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Bureau,
spoke highly of Hong Kong's return to reporters from Hong Kong,
China's inland areas and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The successful practice of the 'one country, two systems'
principle in Hong Kong has created valuable experience for the
stable transition and smooth handover of power in Macao," he said,
adding "It means a model, an encouragement and an inspiration to
the return of Macao."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return not only brushes aside the national
humiliation imposed on China over the past 150 years, but also
shows that China has become increasingly stronger and has the
ability in resolving the issue of national reunification, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems", he said, has
maintained prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. It will also be
of "special significance to the economic growth, social stability
and stable transition in Macao", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that politically, Hong Kong's return
means the first step in China's reunification cause, which will be
followed by the return of Macao. Macao residents will see the
bright future of Macao from the implementation of the "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Economically, Hong Kong's return will increase the economic
cooperation between the two places and it will help Macao's
economic expansion and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The preparation for Macao's return will enter into a new stage
after Hong Kong's return," he stressed, "Today's Hong Kong will be
tomorrow's Macao. The work is entering a key period as Macao's
return is drawing near."

<HEADLINE> Africa Used as Transient Point for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse continues to increase
worldwide with African continent increasingly used as a transient
point for drug trafficking, the World Drug Report 1997 says.
</P>
<P>
The report was launched at a press conference held here today
by the Regional Office for Eastern and Southern Africa of the
United Nations International Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
The UNDCP said in a press release that cocaine continued to
arrive from South America to Southern Africa and was transported
through the continent to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Heroin is also being shipped from Asia enroute to Europe and
North America through the African continent, said the report
which was issued to mark the 10th anniversary of the
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on
June 26.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that illicit drugs were also being produced in
Africa with Morocco, South Africa and Lesotho topping the list of
African cannabis producers.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the report noted, khat produced in east Africa
is perceived as a regional phenomenon but can now be found on the
streets of European cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the production of opium poppy in the
world has more than tripled since 1985 and coca leaf production
has doubled between 1985 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The illicit production of opium gum throughout the world is
estimated to reach 5,000 tons in 1996 with a third of the total
believed to be consumed as opium.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 tons of cocaine were manufactured from 300,000
tons of coca leaf produced last year mainly in Peru, Colombia and
Bolivia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of volume, it stated, the most heavily trafficked
drug in the world is cannabis, and in 1995, 3,000 tons of herbal
cannabis and 1,000 tons of cannabis resin were seized globally.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, cocaine seizures amounted to 251 tons while
31 tons of heroin and 13 tons of morphine were seized the world
over.
</P>
<P>
According to the unofficial UNDCP estimation, the annual
global prevalence rate of illicit drug consumption is likely to
be in the range of 3.3 percent to 4.1 percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
The most widely abused drug is cannabis which is consumed by
about 2.5 percent of the world population or about 140 million
people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 8 million people or 0.14
percent of the global population are taking heroin and at least
13 million people or 0.23 percent of the global population abuse
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted UNDCP Executive Director Giorgio
Giacomelli as saying that the "drug phenomenon is a threat to
every level of society and to international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Giacomell called on all communities in the world to be
mobilized to prevent drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - HK's Imports Up, Domestic Exports Down in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's imports
increased over a year earlier, that of the re-exports decreased
marginally while domestic exports continued to decline on a
year-on-year basis, according to the Census and Statistics
Department (CSD).
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports in May 1997 decreased by 0.8 percent
over a year earlier to 117 billion HK dollars (15 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
within total exports, the value of re-exports decreased
marginally by 0.1 percent to 100.2 billion HK dollars (12.8
billion U.S. dollars), while that of domestic exports decreased by
4.5 percent to 16.8 billion HK dollars (2.15 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports increased by 3.5 percent in May 1997 over
a year earlier to 134.5 billion HK dollars (17.24 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As the value of total exports in May 1997 was less than that of
total imports, there was a visible trade deficit of 17.5 billion
HK dollars (2.24 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was larger than the corresponding deficit of 12 billion HK
dollars (1.53 billion U.S. dollars) in May 1996, but it was
smaller than the deficit of 18.1 billion HK dollars (2.32 billion
U.S. dollars), in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of 1997, the value of total exports
increased by 2.0 percent over the same period last year. Among
this, the value of re-exports rose by 3.3 percent while that of
domestic exports decreased by 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports showed an increase of 4.2 percent. Over
the same period, a visible trade deficit of 83.8 billion HK
dollars (1.07 billion U.S. dollars) was recorded, which is larger
than the deficit of 68.7 billion HK dollars (8.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in the same period in 1996, according to the CSD figures.

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Professor Greets Hong Kong Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Huang Jiayou, dean of the
Geophysics Department at Beijing University, who was born in Hong
Kong in 1940, was excited when he learned that he does not have to
get approval from the British embassy in Beijing if he wants to
visit his elderly in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return is the will of all Chinese," Huang said,
recalling the first gift he received from his sister when he
visited her in Hong Kong last December, the emblem of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
At a symposium on Hong Kong's return, held at the university
today, Xiao Weiyun, a law professor, said that his own
understanding was that the "one country, two systems" policy was
brilliant, and marked a bright future for Hong Kong. Xiao, who is
a member of the committee drafting the Basic Law of the HKSAR,
will fly to Hong Kong tomorrow for the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one country, two systems" concept of Deng
Xiaoping has been the key to dealing with many problems he and
other lawmakers confronted with when drafting the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Xiao expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future development and
prosperity, with Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and the
policy of a high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, dean of the universiy's Guanghua Management
School, said that Hong Kong's prosperity depends on and benefits
from economic reforms in the inland areas. Li, who is an economist,
said that innovation depends on technology, a field in which Hong
Kong is not particularly strong, so it is necessary for Hong Kong
to cooperate with the inland areas for continued development.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's prosperity is good for economic reforms in the
inland. Hong Kong investors like the red chip stocks of the inland
enterprises and this relates to people's confidence in Hong Kong
after 1997, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Liang Shoude, dean of the college of international relations,
said that China is the only country with two social systems, which
is a successful solution to the Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is capable of governing Hong Kong and
governing a country with two systems, and can play an important
role in safeguarding world peace and promoting development, Liang
said.
</P>
<P>
Chi Huisheng, executive vice president of Beijing University,
said that the university will have exchanges and cooperation with
Hong Kong in education, culture, and science and technology to
contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and that it is
ready to open training courses for civil servants in the HKSAR
government on legal and personnel systems, sociology and social
work.

<HEADLINE> ILO Launches Drive for More Jobs for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has outlined a program for more and better
jobs for women, ILO Deputy Director General Mary Chinery-Hesse
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The international program for more and better jobs for women
will be the ILO's specific response to the successful
implementation of the Platform of Action of the fourth World
Conference on Women, and the gender dimensions of the program of
action of the World Summit for Social Development," she said.
</P>
<P>
The program also represents " a concerted effort to reinforce
the ILO's longstanding priorities to promote full employment in
conditions of equality," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the program would show that more jobs for women did
not mean less jobs for men, but that better jobs benefit both
women and men, and that women's productive and remunerative
employment helped families.
</P>
<P>
She said although women had made inroads into previously male
dominated occupations and breached the grass ceiling, "
quantitative increases in economic participation of women had not
matched by qualitative improvements."
</P>
<P>
"Most women remain disadvantaged relative to men in terms of
unequal opportunities and treatment in the labor market", she
said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the need to reform the bases of many current
policies and programs to improve women's employment as they did
not represent the realities of today nor the likely future.

<HEADLINE> Independence And Self-Control In Chinese Christianity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Shi Zesheng, vice-chairman of
the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant
Churches of China, said today that Chinese Christianity should
develop in an independent, self-governing way.
</P>
<P>
The modern history of China is one of suffering, invasions,
oppression, enslavement, and plundering by imperialist powers, and
that some missionaries did not stick to the teachings of the
Bible, but stood on the side of the invaders instead, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Christianity, which came from the West, could not be separated
from imperialist and colonist influences, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The first English missionary to China, who held a post of
vice-consul in the British Embassy in China, definitely knew about
the evil opium trade in 1840," Shi said by way of an example. He
added that several churches set up by the first US missionaries to
China were headed by British opium traders.
</P>
<P>
Foreign missionaries played an important role in the signing of
various unequal treaties, Shi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, we should not regard Christianity in a naive
way. It is true that some foreigners preached Christianity with
pure motives at first, but their belief was distorted and
utilized for other purposes in the end, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are still people today who are using
Christianity as a tool for anti-Chinese activities, and that "We
should not let the old image of foreign Christianity re-emerge at
the new historical era."
</P>
<P>
The principle of "self-administration, self-support, and
self-propagation" among the Protestant churches appeared shortly
after the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
This notion was emphasized at the 6th session of the Chinese
Christianity Foundation early this year, Shi said, and the CPC's
policies on religion have brought closer ties between religious
people, the state, and society, and that religion "has found its
location in the country's development."

<HEADLINE> Southern African States Winning Anti-inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries,
battling high inflation in their economies, have scored dramatic
successes in the past few months due to a generally good
agricultural season across the region, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Former hyper-inflation-ridden economies of Mozambique, Zambia
and Malawi have all recorded a sustained deceleration in
inflation, with Malawi's annual rate dropping to 7.2 percent last
April from a high of 80 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which has seen its inflation rate rised to above 20
percent recently, is still to record a sustained deceleration in
the rate of increase in prices to the extent achieved by its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's rate of inflation, defined as a sustained
increase in the prices of goods in 1994, was pegged at 70.2
percent, but latest figures from the National Statistics Board
shows a sharp drop ranging from 15.3 percent in Maputo to 19
percent in the northern city of Nampula.
</P>
<P>
While the sharp fall in inflation has been attributed to the
excellent harvest in 1996, the stabilization of the Mozambican
Metical and the fall in the South African Rand resulted in the
fall in prices of imports from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, relentlessly pursuing economic reforms, also has
something to show for its perseverance with latest figures
showing that inflation now averages 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
At one time inflation in the copper-producing country was
galloping at 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Malawi have taken tough measures to reduce public
spending with Zambia selling off almost all public enterprises
while Malawi has introduced a cash budget, spending only
according to revenue realized.

<HEADLINE> China Making Great Effort To Fight Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun,
speaking to a televised meeting held by the State Council today,
called on many parts of the country to take immediate steps to
fight drought to protect the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
By June 23, droughts had hit 17.3 million ha of crops, 58
million of which were hit severely.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters say that in late June most parts of north
China will have less rainfall, while the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze River, China's longest, will probably suffer from
a summer drought, Jiang warned.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million people are working daily in the nationwide
drought relief campaign, and have managed to irrigate or preserve
soil moisture on four million ha of drought-stricken crops.
</P>
<P>
But much remains in the drought-relief work, as the drought
gets worse, and because of the arrival of summer planting, a
greater effort must be made to plant as much as is possible, he
urged.
</P>
<P>
Harvests and increases in farmers' income are important to
China's reforms, development, and stability, and people must put
their heart into this work, he said.
</P>
<P>
People in some areas were overjoyed by the summer harvest, and
are still counting heavily on good weather. But something must be
done to show them just severe the drought is, and how to make the
most of limited water resources for summer planting, he said.
</P>
<P>
A better job must be done in purchasing grains. Unauthorized
charges or getting funds from farmers must be strictly prohibited
to lessen their burden, and the land contract policy will remain
unchanged for another 30 years. Those who violate the regulations
will be punished, he emphasized.

HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A North-South Corridor of
Science and Technology will be built along the Hong Kong section
of the Kowloon-Guangdong Railway linking the city with neighboring
Guangdong Province, a Hong Kong government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Leung Po-wing, Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands,
explained that it will be part of his agency's efforts to ease the
pressure from the sustained development a booming service industry
on the already congested downtown area.
</P>
<P>
The service industry has been flourishing in Hong Kong since
the beginning of the 1980s, promoting the adjustment of the
region's economic structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet this has also resulted in shortages of office and
residential buildings in the downtown area, Leung added.
</P>
<P>
To ease the congestion in the old city area, he noted, the
government plans to build more facilities along the city's
north-south traffic trunk, and new business service centers at the
junctions of railways and highways.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to build Hong Kong into a commercial, economic and
high-tech service center with a high added value, as well as a
first-rate convention and exhibition center," said Leung.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government will encourage private businesses to
invest in such projects, while the public sector will also provide
support.

kg of marijuana, a kilogram of heroin, and 119 opium bulbs that

largest amount ever seized at one time.
</P>
<P>
Tibet for a long time was proud to be drug-free. But the
penetration by international drug cartels in recent years has
brought an increasing number of drug-related crimes in the
region. Local officials have vowed to crack down on drugs to keep

</P>
<P>
The money is part of the 100 million dollars extra credit for

<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A court in Mombasa, the biggest
port city in Kenya, has ordered a suspected Dutch international
drug trafficker extradited to the United States to answer to
charges of trafficking in 65 tons of hashish.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. marshalls are due to arrive in Kenya to collect the
Dutchman, identified as Wouter van Frassen, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The court order came on Wednesday after the Netherlands'
government withdrew its extradition claim on the suspect.
</P>
<P>
Frassen was arrested together with four Indonisian nationals
on May 13 aboard a vessel carrying about 65 tons of hashish off
African coast to the U.S. in April, 1996, said the report quoting
John Burns, an agent from the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
John Burns also provided with evidence that the Dutchman has
been trafficking in narcotic drug between Far East countries,
Africa coast and America.
</P>
<P>
Frassen was approached by a drug baron in early 1995 to
transport a large quantity of hashish from the African coast to
the U.S., said Burns.
</P>
<P>
Burns said his agency has established that Frassen is a drug
trafficker after thorough investigations which include monitoring
his telephone conversations and business records.

<HEADLINE> Japan Asks Russia to Probe Shooting Near Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Foreign Ministry today asked
the Russian government to investigate whether Russian coast guards
were involved in a shooting incident near the dispute Habomai
Island in which two Japanese fishermen were injured.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials from the Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) said
that an unidentified ship fired on the 4.7-ton Japanese fishing
boat, with three crewmen on board, in waters near the Habomai
island late on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MSA has not yet been able to confirm the nationality of the
ship which opened fire and the Russian side has not yet responded
to Japan's inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Russian patrol boats fired on two Japanese fishing
vessels in waters near the Habomai island, injuring two crewmen.
</P>
<P>
Habomai and three other Russian-held islands, located northeast
of Japan's main northern island of Hokkaido, were taken by the
Soviet Red Army in the last days of World War II. Japan has
refused to sign a World War II peace treaty with Moscow without
the return of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly accused Japanese fishing boats of
poaching in Russian waters and the two countries have held several
rounds of talks since March 1995 to try and resolve the dispute
over the safety of Japanese fishing boats near the islands.

<P>
The Shenzhen Compulsory Rehabilitation Center is supposed to be
the best in the country. Two-thirds of the addicts are university
and middle school students and unemployed young people.
</P>
<P>
According to staff members, young people aged 12 to 25
accounted for 59 percent of the 6,000 addicts undergoing
rehabilitation in the center from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
When explaining why young people are easy victims, Zhou
Liqiang, an expert at the center, told the reporter that young
people are full of curiosity and it is difficult for them to tell
right from wrong without sufficient education, and the main reason
is that they have no information at all about the harm of drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, most schools have paid little attention to
providing young students with information about narcotics because
the number of drug addicts is still quite small.
</P>
<P>
"Schools should be in charge of students' actions when they
enter society," Zhou commented, meaning that they should be
educated about the evils of drugs.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that students be organized to visit some
rehabilitation centers as extra-curricular activities. Parents and
other people should also help educate them about the harm of drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
To combat trafficking, smuggling, and drug abuse, the Chinese
government is running a nation-wide campaign against drugs from

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Drug Abuse on Rise in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse and trafficking in
this Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal has been on rise in recent years,
leading to an increase in theft, pickpocketing, use of fatal
weapons and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
Though the history of drug abuse is quite short in Nepal, it is
spreading its clutches at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
There are three forms of drug crime in the country, namely
addiction, trafficking and production, Nepali Home Ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug addicts have doubled in the country in the
past six years to about 50,000, with 10 percent of them being
women.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that during the 11 months from July 1996 to
May 1997, the police have seized 3,889 kg of marijuana, hashish
and heroin.
</P>
<P>
The number of those arrested on charges of drug abuse and
trafficking increased from 56 in 1982 to 725 in 1996, and a total
of 6,676 persons have been arrested on the same charges in the
past 17 years, according to figures provided by the Narcotic
Control Division (NCD) of the Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The number of addicts using hemp, hashish and heroin is
decreasing, while an increasing number of them are turning to
narcotic tablets, injections and phensedyl since 1991, said the
NCD.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, most of the addicts begin by taking oral tablets and
then move over to intravenous (IV) drugs. Because of the sharing
of syringes, IV drugs are especially harmful and risky.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 637 AIDS patients in Nepal, 12 were found to be drug
addicts. Even worse, the majority of the drug addicts had donated
blood, a research said.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is now poised as a serious social problem in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said that 13 percent of pickpockets are drug
users, 5 percent of theft are related to drug abuse, which is also
blamed for such crimes as hooliganism and use of fatal weapons.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Nepali government has taken sorts of
measures to curb the rising trend of drug abuse in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Narcotics Control Act 1988 has specifically banned the
selling of some medicines which can lead to addiction without the
doctors' prescription.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Nepali government began to implement a program for
drug control in cooperation with the United Nations Drug Control
Program (UNDCP), involving police, custom officers and social
workers.
</P>
<P>
Currently the government is implementing a narcotic control
master plan prepared with the cooperation of UNDCP in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, efforts are being made to control illegal
production, trafficking, peddling and abuse of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the police has launched a drug abuse control and
rehabilitation program that aims to bring under control the number
of drug addicts and illegal trade in drugs in the Kathmandu
Valley, home to the majority of drug addicts in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Despite these efforts, illegal hemp cultivation still exists in
the southern and some other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
And the relapse rate in Nepal is as high as 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted the cruxes lie in this important fact that much
of the ongoing measures are of a short-term nature. In order to
produce the desired outcome, measures need to be sustained over
the long haul through greater commitment and patience based on an
increased sense of collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The fact that there is not a proper rehabilitation center for
drug addicts in Nepal may also help explain why drug addiction is
on rise.
</P>
<P>
Yet, public awareness against drug abuse is thought to be
essential to control drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the International Day Against Drug Abuse and
Trafficking is observed Thursday throughout Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Future of Hong Kong Aviation Promising, Says Boeing Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The president of Boeing China
predicted today that there would be even greater expansion of Hong
Kong's aviation industry after the region returns to the
motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
There will be more commercial opportunities in China, said Mike
Zimmerman, who noted that the past, present, and future of Hong
Kong "goes hand in hand" with commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman pointed out that China will have the fastest air
travel growth of any region in the world, with benefits for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as a consequence, because
it is "central to the country's international trade, banking, and
other dealings with the world."
</P>
<P>
China represents a tenth of the 1.1-trillion-US-dollar market
for new airplanes in the world for the next two decades, with more
than 1,900 new jets needed, he said. And the new airport at Chek
Lap Kok in Hong Kong will further consolidate Hong Kong's position
as Asia's premier aviation hub.
</P>
<P>
He said that jets with a single aisle will grow in importance
in China, and represent more than 70 percent of all deliveries
over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Countless new point-to-point aviation services between the
China's inland area and Hong Kong will be inaugurated with 737
and 757 airplanes," said Zimmerman. "Later, as these markets
mature, they can be served with 767s or even 777s," he added.
</P>
<P>
With 737s already accounting for 60 percent of all jet aircraft
delivered to China, the next generation of 737 offers more for
operators looking to expand into the Chinese market, he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said that a fourth type of the Boeing 737 is
currently being evaluated. The 737-900X is a twinjet that will
seat up to 178 passengers in two classes.

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A long scroll painting and a large
statue have been completed in the cities of Beijing and Shenzhen
to greet the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The "Picture of the Great Wall" was painted on a 360-meter-long
scroll by Sun Yingdong, a 55-year-old artist at the Beijing Youth
Film Studio.
</P>
<P>
"The painting expresses my joyous feelings about the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland," said the artist, who took 14 months
to paint 99 scenes from the Great Wall on the paper roll.
</P>
<P>
The statue, "A Sail Returning from the Sea", is 19.97 meters
high and is made of white marble. It was carved at the end of the
Luohu Bridge in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese characters for "return", inlaid with gold, is
carved on the sail. On the four-meter-high pedestal are bronze
castings about the history of Hong Kong, from being ceded to
Britain to its return to the Motherland.
</P>
<P>
The statue, which is valued at four million yuan (about 482,000
US dollars), will be unveiled on July 1.

BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz arrived in Lebanon this afternoon on a visit, the first
by a Saudi royal member since 1975 when Lebanese 15-year civil war
erupted.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince, with his 140-member entourage, came to
Lebanon by land from a two-day visit to Damascus and was received
on the Lebanese-Syrian border by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Abdullah will have meetings with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Hariri, House Speaker Nabih Berri
and will inspect some projects of reconstruction in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hariri has hailed the landmark visit of Saudi crown prince
as an enormous boost to Lebanon's reconstruction drive and a
display of the strong bond between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening a weekly cabinet session Wednesday night, the Lebanese
prime minister noted that Abdullah's visit to Syria and Lebanon
comes at a particularly critical time when Israel continues
to occupy the Arab land and the Israeli-Turkish security pact
pose threat to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February 1996 generated fear in Middle East countries that Turkey
was aligning itself with the Jewish state against Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Hariri added the visit is of "utmost importance to Lebanon as
it reflects Saudi Arabia's keen interest in our causes."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Saudi Arabia's contribution to Lebanon's
reconstruction drive through grants and donations that have
topped 500 million U.S. dollars in the past few years.

Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a
meeting here today to greet Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Vice-chairman Ye Xuanping of

concept of Deng Xiaoping's "One country, two systems" and said he
considers it a guarantee for the stable transition and smooth
return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The concept reflects Deng's broad thinking as a patriot and
his foresight and sagacity as a statesman," Wu said, noting that

Chinese nationalities and shows a practical approach that takes
Hong Kong's history and reality into consideration.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kai Tak International
Airport in Hong Kong will be built into a new town for 300,000
residents after the new airport opens in Chek Lap Kok in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments in Hong Kong are drawing up plans to gear
this prime area with the project to fill up the sea in the Kowloon
Bay, Leung Po-wing, secretary for Planning Environment and Lands,
said today.
</P>
<P>
With the progress of the sea filling-up project, large-scale
construction will begin in the year 2001, so that residents will
be able to move in before the year 2006, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the location of the Kai Tak airport, construction
planning and development in Kowloon have long been restricted.
</P>
<P>
In future, the whole Kowloon Bay including the site of the Kai
Tak Airport will be used mainly for construction of high-density
buildings, such as residential quarters, office buildings and
commercial facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, proper arrangements will also be made for the
construction of parks and transportation facilities, the official
said, adding that a small area will be used to develop
pollution-free industries.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Government will announce an overall plan for construction in the
Kowloon Bay for public discussion.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Hong Kong Tourist Association said that
after the closure of the Kai Tak Airport, the 280 ha of land
vacated plus the 300 ha secured from sea filling up will make it
possible to build a number of new scenic spots and tourism
facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain has urged Germany not to pull
out of their joint project with Italy and Spain to build a new
type of jet fighter, Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
Germany's withdrawal "would deal a blow to all our efforts to
strengthen the European space and aviation industry against
growing competition from the United States," said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson in an interview with the German daily
Bild Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
The German government is said to be reviewing its role in the
65 billion U.S.-dollar scheme in a bid to cut state spending so as
to ensure that it meets the membership criteria for the planned
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is expected to announce on July 11, as part of its 1998
budget, whether it will take part in the Eurofighter project.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Britain, Italy and Spain have already
approved the project and plan to buy 232, 121 and 87 Eurofighters
respectively. The German armed forces intended to buy 180
fighters at a cost of about 23 billion marks (about 13.6 billion
dollars).

since 1980s the country is not amongst the poorest 10 countries
in the world, said the report issued in London recently.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM's New Chief Assures Objectivity to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq has assured Iraq that he will be
"objective" in his work related to the inspection missions.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency reported today that Richard
Rutler, who is to replace the present UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus on
July 1, made the promise Wednesday at a meeting in New York with
Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Rutler said that his efforts to be objective will be based on
cooperation with Iraq to solve the problem of eliminating weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq, including ballistic missiles,
biological and chemical weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM's new chief said he is happy with his first meeting
with Aziz, who is on a visit to the U.N. Aziz also expressed his
happiness to work with Rutler, saying that Iraq will cooperate
fully with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing Ekeus of taking a "biased" stance
towards it and said that he is a politician rather than a
U.N. official. Its denial of the entry of U.N. inspectors into
chosen sites has prompted the Security Council to threaten with
tougher sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Rutler, Australia's U.N. ambassador, was appointed early in May
as the new executive chairman of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is not allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,
including missiles with ranges beyond 150 kilometers, after its
troops were defeated by the U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991
Gulf War triggered by its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM in charge of scrapping the weapons suspects Iraq
still possesses a considerable number of the missiles. However,
Baghdad denies concealing any such weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Youths to Stay Away From Drugs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is looking
for more effective ways and various activities to teach young
people to stay away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the nation-wide campaign is to increase young
people's ability to avoid drug addiction and to fight drug
abuse. The National Narcotics Control Committee (NNCC) says that
since June, millions of schoolboys and girls in urban and rural
areas of south China's Guangdong, Fujian and Yunnan provinces have
held anti-narcotics demonstrations, and many students have taken
an oath to fight drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the majority of colleges and middle and
primary schools have put drug education at their list of programs
and gave students classes on narcotics before the end of the
spring semester.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction has been avoided in China for more than 30
years, but with the growth in international drug smuggling and
sales, it has begun to reappear in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security says that the number of
reported or registered drug abusers in China in 1995 was 520,000,
but experts estimate that the real figure is much larger.
</P>
<P>
A NNCC report shows that drug addicts have been found in about
70 percent of China's cities and counties, and that the majority
are young people.
</P>
<P>
"It was because of ignorance that I first touched drugs. If we
had been educated about the evils of drugs, I wouldn't have become
addicted," a 16-year-old addict who declined to give her name told
the reporter at a rehabilitation center in Shenzhen, China's first
special economic zone, in Guangdong Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The German government is to sell 25
percent of its remaining stake in the German telecom giant
Deutsche Telekom to help meet membership targets for joining the
planned single European currency, the Euro, the government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached between the government and the Telekom on
Thursday, the shares are to be transferred to the state-owned Bank
for Reconstruction in 1997 and 1998. The move is expected to
generate 25 billion German marks (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) for
the financially strapped government.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that the shares would not be
permitted to be sold on the stock exchange before the year 2000, a
promise made by the government when the Telekom first went public
in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the Telekom would be allowed to offer parts of the
shares to "strategic investors" in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer told a general meeting of
shareholders Thursday that the deal would help the company develop
as "a global player on the world market" by increasing its
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Bonn currently holds about 74 percent of the Telekom
shares.

-- Sailor on the Seven Seas aboard the "Calypso", Jacques-Yves
Cousteau, one of the most well-known Frenchmen in the world, died
Wednesday in Paris at 87. Through numerous films he shot on the
under-water world, Cousteau made tens of thousands of people
worldwide to love the ocean and to become aware of the danger of
ocean pollution. While some regard the oceanographer as a sincere

his red wool bonnet is liked by the world.

violently harassed Wednesday by the guard of President Pascal
Lissouba, who accused France of abandoning his country. Meanwhile,
the "Cobras" militiamen of former President Denis Sassou N'Guesso

earlier this month.
</P>

KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the Philippines
plan to enhance their student exchange program in a bid to improve
the educational cooperation between the two countries, Philippine
Education, Culture and Sports Secretary Ricardo Gloria said today.
</P>
<P>
The program to be known as "sisterhood" or "homestay" would be
implemented this year at secondary school level, he told
reporters after a meeting with Malaysian Acting Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim here.
</P>
<P>
"The program package is being worked out," Gloria said, who is
here as head of a three-member delegation on a four-day visit to
Malaysia in his capacity as president of the Southeast Asian
Ministers' of Education Council (SEAMIEC).
</P>
<P>
Priority would be given to educational programs before both
countries branch out to other fields such as culture, arts and
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gloria, Malaysia and the Philippines also proposed
to have exchange programs for teachers and principals to learn
more about teaching techniques and approaches.
</P>
<P>
As SEAMIEC president, Gloria hoped the program would be
expanded to other Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the governments of the Southeast Asian countries should
invest more in education, particularly in science, mathematics and
English subjects as the three subjects, in his view, were the most
vital "tools" to compete in the global education system.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with Anwar ways to improve educational
programs among Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Banker Calls for Bigger Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A leading Nigerian bank has called
for the introduction of bigger currency notes to reduce the risks
and inconvenience associated with large-scale cash movement.
</P>
<P>
Michel Accad, Managing Director of the Nigeria International
Bank, made the call last week at the
June monthly meeting of the Money Market Association in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the biggest note is 50 Naira (less than 60 U.S. Cents)
at the moment, the banker advised the introduction of 500 and
1,000-Naira notes.
</P>
<P>
Turning down the saying that introduction of
high-denomination notes will worsen the inflation situation,
Accad said, "The
only reliable check on inflation is fiscal and monetary
discipline."
</P>
<P>
The manager of a Lagos-based merchant bank supported Accad's
view of point. He urged the central bank to take actions to save
traders who are forced to carry large sum of cash in transacting
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now uses notes of 50, 20, 10 and five-Naira, while an
ordinary business transaction is likely to involve tens of
thousands of Naira. It is a common thing to see people carrying
cash in sacks in Nigerian banks just to pay their phone bills.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Committed to Gender Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
committed to the effective integration of women in the
development process of the country, said Community Development
Minister Newstead Zimba.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a gender sensitization
workshop for members of parliament and councillors here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said that the government has established the Gender
Development Division based at cabinet office to demonstrate its
commitment.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, women comprise 51 percent of the total
population but analysis of various socio-economic activities has
revealed that women participation level is very low and
disparities do not correspondent with the population ratios.
</P>
<P>
"More men are in management and technical jobs and women are
relegated to low paying jobs and lower levels of the informal
sector," Zimba said, at present women are finding it difficult to
take up decision making roles both personally and at institution
levels because of lack of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
Zimba urged society to remove all gender barriers which
inhibit women from participating actively in decision-making
bodies especially in politics.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Party Leader Optimistic About Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will maintain
its political stability and economic prosperity after its return
to China, a senior Colombian political leader said today.
</P>
<P>
"The fears ... that there would be a collision between two
ideological concepts with economic repercussions were overrated,"
Co-President of Colombia's ruling National Liberal Party Emilio
Lebolo Castellanos told Xinhua in an exclusive interview at the
party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of Hong Kong on July 1 is of significant
importance and will help put China in the ranks of leading
economic powers in the future world.
</P>
<P>
Lebolo Castellanos added he believes that the concept of "one
country, two systems" applied by the Chinese government to solve
the Hong Kong issue is to bring about a revaluation of economic
process among different ideologies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one country, two systems" principle put
forward by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will provide
experience to other countries for resolving similar issues.
</P>
<P>
"We no longer have to believe that two countries, with
different ideological conceptions, must confront each other. We
have to learn how to think about living together," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are friends of the People's Republic of China. We have
followed closely, with great concern and admiration at the same
time, the whole historical process that China is experiencing," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Afghanistan on Ending Afghan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani has discussed with an Iranian envoy on ways of
ending the ongoing Afghan crisis, an official report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
However, the official news agency IRNA gave no specific time or
place of the said meeting because, as an IRNA editor contacted by
phone put it, of "security reasons."
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the meeting between Rabbani and the
Iraian envoy took place shortly after the talks between Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on June 17.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unknown what kind of agreement, if any,
Rafsanjani and Sharif have reached in their meeting mainly
focusing on the protracted civil war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad and Tehran are at odds over their support for rival
Afghan factions. Iran accuses Pakistan of supporting the Taliban
which has already controlled 90 percent of the territory in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is believed to have been wielding influence on the
Taliban and wants to consolidate its strategic position in
Afghanistan and expand its influence to Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has suffered a big blow since Kabul fell into the
hands of Taliban and Rabbani, who has had the support of Tehran,
was driven northward last September.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian envoy, Alla'eddin Boroujerdi, who is deputy foreign
minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs, discussed with Rabbani the
latest developments in Afghanistan, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani was quoted as saying that that Afghan Islamic
government was for restoration of peace and creation of an
atmosphere of mutual understanding in Afghanistan and would
strongly and decisively surpress any measure adopted against the
country.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned blatant support of "certain foreign
countries" for the Taliban, which groups Islamic student
militants, falling short of accusing Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He regarded "alien intervention as the main factor behind
Afghan crisis" and said that the Afghan Moslem government wants to
see an immediate end to the present foreign interference in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran respected all Afghan tribes, including
Pashtuns, Tajikis, Uzbeks and Hezares, believing that each should
have a role in the formation of a popular Islamic government in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that Iran is ready to offer any kind of help
to the Afghan Moslem nation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ruling Party's Youth Wing Condemns Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian ruling party United
Malays National Organization(UMNO)'s youth wing today protested
against Israel for the impending shift of its capital from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, the site of one of Islam's holiest mosques.
</P>
<P>
Movement leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said at a press conference
the UMNO Youth executive council, which met for three hours here
today, voiced its strong protest, condemning Israel for its
insolence, and describing the planned shift of capital as an
arrogant move that would derail the West Asia peace process.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO youth leader urged Malaysian Foreign Minister Abddulah
Ahmad Badawi to immediately communicate with the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC)'s "contact group" countries to get all
the OIC nations to pressure Israel.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO youth leader also urged all local non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to contact their counterparts abroad to bear
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO youth organization would cooperate with all NGOs in
holding rallies to declare their stand against Israeli insolence
and protest the United States' adoption of a resolution
recognizing Jerusalem as the new Israeli capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the US move contravened the United Nations Security
Council's Resolution 425 of 1978 which rejected any attempt to
change the demographic position and status of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - One Country, Two Monetary Systems After July 1: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and China's inland
areas will implement the principle of one country, two currencies
and two monetary systems in handling their monetary relations
after July 1, a senior Hong Kong monetary official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), said at a media briefing: "We have been working closely
with the Chinese authorities to define even more clearly the
monetary relations between Hong Kong and the inland areas of China
under the concept of "one country, two systems" and within the
legal framework laid down in the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's monetary arrangements through 1997, Yam
told some 100 local and overseas journalists: "'One country, two
systems' means one country, two currencies and two monetary
systems,"
</P>
<P>
"Each other's currency will continue to be considered as
foreign currency. In other word, the Hong Kong dollar is treated
as a foreign currency in the inland areas and the Renminbi, a
foreign currency in Hong Kong," said the chief executive of the
HKMA, which acts as the de facto central bank of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law states that the Hong Kong dollar, as the legal
tender in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
shall continue to circulate, and shall remain freely convertible.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that the HKSAR government shall provide an
appropriate economic and legal environment for the maintenance of
the status of Hong Kong as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the HKSAR Government shall, on its own, formulate
monetary and financial policies, safeguard the free operation of
financial business and financial markets, and regulate and
supervise them in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
"The two currencies and the two corresponding monetary systems
are of equal importance to China. One is not subsidiary to the
other and they are to be mutually independent," said the Hong Kong
official.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between the two monetary authorities -- the
HKMA and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Yam said: "They are to
be mutually independent. This is demonstrated by the fact that
both the HKMA and the PBOC are members of a number of central
banking forums and institutions, such as the Bank of International
Settlement and the Asia Development Bank."
</P>
<P>
As the economies of Hong Kong and the inland areas are becoming
more integrated, there is obviously a need for greater cooperation
on the monetary front, said the HKMA's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after July 1, Hong Kong-based financial
institutions funded by the inland areas must abide by Hong Kong
laws and will not enjoy any privilege.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong and the inland areas can join forces
in supervising financial institutions and maintaining currency
stability in Hong Kong. "There is a complementary and mutually
reinforcing relationship," said Yam.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Jolts East Iran Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.2 degrees
on the Richter scale jolted Qa'en region, about 800 kilometers
east of the capital, the state-run Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the quake occurred at 9.25 a.m. local time
(04:55 GMT) this morning in the eastern Khorasan province.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far, though the damages to
the villages that survived previous tremors in this area appeared
to be extensive.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Headquarters for Natural Disasters dispatched its relief
workers and experts to the quake-stricken area this morning to
help the people and assess the damage, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was an aftershock of the 7.1 degree magnitude quake
which hit Birjand and Qa'en on May 10 and claimed about 2,400
lives.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has already allocated funds for the
reconstruction of those areas, and pledged new quake-resistant
homes to be built in the quake-prone regions.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Interview: HK's Civil Service Ranks Are Stable, Says Administrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhou Zongxin
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- "A smooth transition is coming
without any problem and we're all confident of Hong Kong's
future," said Lam Woon-kwong, Hong Kong's Secretary for the Civil
Service in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
After 23 years' service in the govornment and now as head of
the Civil Service Branch, Lam oversees matters concerning the
180,000 people directly employed by the Hong Kong government --
from their employment, promotion, punishment to retirement.
</P>
<P>
Lam has been appointed Secretary for the Civil Service for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) by China's central
government.
</P>
<P>
"The civil servants' ranks are very stable now," Lam said,
citing only four percent of the civil servants having left the
ranks during the past 12 months, which represents the lowest rate
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
"With just days left before the handover, government
departments are operating normally and steadily. The civil
servants at various levels are in a fairly good mental state," Lam
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's highly successful civil service system features
three major characteristics, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The criterion for recruiting new civil servants is that they
should be talented and capable, and their selection is through a
public application process.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's civil servants receive fairly high pay, which works
to guard against corruption and talent drainage.
</P>
<P>
And a highly efficient system and the order of law are adopted
for their management, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Service Branch is the government department
responsible for working out and revising the system, policies and
regulations governing the management of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Lam cited a strict and systematized management network as one
of the three major factors behind the stable status of civil
service ranks.
</P>
<P>
The two other factors are Hong Kong's fast economic progress
during the past decades, which has made possible high pay for
civil servants, and an increased watch-dog function played by
community and media, according to Lam.
</P>
<P>
He said these factors are expected to be further strengthened
after the handover. "The Basic Law has laid down articles with
clear and unequivocal wording on ensuring Hong Kong's civil
service system. As China's economy enjoys prosperity, a bright
future can be foreseen for Hong Kong's development and financial
status in the future," Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"And the Basic Law provides that freedom of speech and of the
press shall be maintained as well. So, to draw a reasonable
inference from all these analyses, we are fairly confident of the
future," said Lam.
</P>
<P>
"From the preparatory process for the establishment of the SAR
government, especially after the appoinment of Tung Chee Hwa as
the SAR's Chief Executive, the central government has given him
full confidence and trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has greatly strengthened our confidence in the principle
of 'One Country, Two Systems' and 'Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong'," Lam added.
</P>
<P>
Lam, who has visited most parts of the Chinese mainland
including Tibet since 1978, encourages his colleagues for such
visits so as to know more about the rest of China. "Seeing is
believing. Our country has changed so fast that you can know this
better and deeper only when you are there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong in 1951, Lam joined the Administrative
Service
in 1974 after graduating from the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Deputy Director of Regional Services in 1989,
Deputy Secretary for Civil Service, Civil Service Branch in 1991,
Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower, Education and
Manpower Branch in 1993 and Director of Education in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lam took up the current post of Secretary for Civil Service in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was married in 1978 but has no children.
</P>
<P>
Lam's hobbies include reading, traveling and movies. He is a
soccer fan but has not watched local competitions since the
retirement of his favorite player Wong Man-wai in the 1980s.
"Hong Kong soccer needs star players," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he manages never to miss World Cup finals, especially
championship finals. He would enjoy both live broadcast and
tape-recorded
programs over and over again.

<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and four
others wounded early this morning when a small bus carrying them
was ambushed by Muslim extremists in Basilan province, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A group of Abu Sayyaf members ambushed the bus along a highway
near Isabela, capital of Basilan, the local television ABS-CBN
reported in its evening newscast.
</P>
<P>
After the ambush, Regional Police Director Renato Arguldar
called on policemen in the province to intensify their efforts to
eliminate Abu Sayyaf elements.
</P>
<P>
The ambush was the second strike in four days by the Muslim
extremist group on the island province.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, four farmers were slain by eight armed Abu Sayyaf
members in a village near Isabela for refusing to pay
"revolutionary tax", police confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials have urged the military to wage a
comprehensive offensive to eradicate the Muslim extremist group,
which has shunned peace talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> HK Investment Funds to Have Vast Room for Expansion in Post- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming return of Hong Kong
to China on July 1 will open a tremendous opportunity for Hong
Kong's investment funds to achieve further development, local
professionals said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the local media, Andrew Lo, chairman
of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, said the fund
sector is generally optimistic about the prospects of Hong Kong's
financial market.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong returns to China, the development of funds in
the country's interior areas will create many opportunities for
fund companies based in Hong Kong," Lo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the funds have much room for development in
China's interior areas, where 1.2 billion people have a huge
savings deposit but there are not enough channels of investment.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign-funded fund companies in Hong Kong will benefit a
great deal once a law concerning fund management is adopted in the
interior areas," he noted.
</P>
<P>
An important way of investment in the financial market, the
funds are mainly composed of stocks, the monetary market, bonds
and other categories. There are now 1,000 funds with government
recognition in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1986, the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association is
a professional body representing the local fund management sector.
It now has 45 member companies, which manage funds of various
kinds worth a total of 100 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the local financial system, Lo said, the fund
sector has contributed greatly to Hong Kong's current status as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"Since a large proportion of the capital under the management
of local fund companies comes from overseas, Hong Kong's fund
management is playing a vital role in the financial and economic
circle of the entire Asia-Pacific region," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the funds can exert two significant effects on the
economy, namely, stabilizing the market, and increasing efficiency
in the use of capital.
</P>
<P>
"With a thriving funds market, China's interior areas will
enjoy a more stable economic environment and rely less on the
foreign capital," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He added that his association is planning to launch two
short-term training programs each year, in an effort to help the
interior areas to foster a team of skilled personnel in fund
management.
</P>
<P>
In the years ahead, he predicted, all Hong Kong fund companies
would set up research centers in China's interior areas, and some
companies of larger sizes would also expand their business to the
interior area.
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that with its unique advantages, Hong Kong will
retain its status as the regional headquarters for fund
companies," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zoo keepers in charge of
Manchurian tigers at Shangqiu Zoo, in central China's Henan
Province, are celebrating the recent arrival of ten healthy cubs.
</P>
<P>
The births, to three Manchurian tigers, is the latest chapter
in the zoo's tiger-breeding success story. Over the last decade,
68 cubs have been born to these big rare cats, indigenous but
endangered in northeast China. Some 80 percent of the new
arrivals have survived.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers come under the first category of
state-protected animals, and they were previously regarded as
being difficult to breed in captivity. Shangqiu Zoo started to
breed the big cats back in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tengzhan, director of the zoo, has bred three tigers, and
one of them in turn has given birth to 31 cubs with 24 of them
surviving. The zoo is one of the leading centers for breeding
Manchurian tigers in China.

<HEADLINE> Rising Seas to Flood Cyprus' Coast in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Larnaca airport and other
low-lying areas of the this eastern Mediterranean island could be
flooded by rising sea water if nothing is to be done to halt
global warming, Cyprus Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Loizos Hadjioannou, a Cypriot meteorological
service official, as saying that "if pollution continues at the
present rate, and nothing is done to stop it, then, according to
scientific models, a problem with rising sea levels may exist."
</P>
<P>
Hadjioannou said that Larnaca airport, which has an elevation
of just one meter above sea level, could be flooded in about 50
years if scientific predictions proved accurate.
</P>
<P>
Areas like Larnaca bay, at southern coast, Famagusta bay, at
eastern coast and the coast of Paphos of western part of the
island could also face flooding problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict sea levels will rise by between 30 and 100
centimeters over the next century as the planet grows warmer, if
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are not
reduced.
</P>
<P>
These gases, principally generated by the burning of fossil
fuels like oil and coal, trap the sun's heat, raising global
temperatures and causing polar ice caps to melt releasing water
into the oceans, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
However, Hadjioannou said for Cyprus, sea level rises are a
"future worry".
</P>
<P>
"This matter is not so critical for Cyprus as it is for Indian
Ocean states where whole islands may be inundated," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Cyprus joined other small island nations at the
U.N. Earth Summit in New York in calling for immediate actions to
halt global warming.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-HK Garment Industry Turns to Market in Interior Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This will be the ninth consecutive year for TDC to organize
local business people to attend the annual fair, which is cited as
an "ideal springboard" to enter into the potentially-huge garment
market in northeast China.
As local garment industry turns to the market in the interior
area,
Hong Kong is planning and making active preparations to increase
the presence of its textile industry at the market in the
interior.
Breakdowns show that the retail sales of Liaoning, one of the
three northeastern provinces, alone reached 112.6 billion yuan in
1994, ranking the fourth place nationally.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 69 Hong Kong companies attending the fair struck a
total of orders worth 182 million HK dollars and sold two million
HK dollars worth of goods at the fair site, and received orders
worth 99.8 million HK dollars during business talks, according to
TDC figures.
</P>
<P>
With rapid rise in people's living standards, many brand-name
garments made in Hong Kong, such as "Playboy", "Crocodile",
"Jeanwest" and "Puma" have been selling well in many parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Jeanwest International (HK) disclosed the
company has already opened more than 300 chain stores in some 20
provinces and municipalities, all of which have made profits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company plans to increase the number of its
outlets to 380 at the end of this year, and proceed to 500 in late
1998 and to 1000 in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Defends China's Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The president of Human Rights
Society of China, Zhu Muzhi, challenged the Western accusations
against China's human rights record in a speech delivered to the
Carlos III University of Madrid today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, heading a Chinese human rights delegation, arrived here in
the last leg of their four-nation Europe tour which has taken them
to Norway, Sweden and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Following are the main points of his speech entitled "China's
Development and Human Rights:"
</P>
<P>
It is acknowledged by the world that China has achieved great
development in recent years. But what does this development mean
to the Chinese people and the world, fortune or misfortune? Some
gentlemen in Western countries seem to have views just opposite to
those of the Chinese people: the Chinese people regard it as a
good fortune while those gentlemen take it as a disaster. Back in
the years before this boom, China received little criticism and at
times even some favorable comments. But after China's rapid
development, more and more accusing fingers were pointed at it.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people believe that China's development has helped
the country make great achievements in human rights. For instance,
nearly all Chinese people now have got enough food and clothing,
that is, they enjoy the right of survival. Resulting from this,
other human rights were also remarkably improved.
</P>
<P>
China takes pride in the fact that it feeds 1.2 billion people,
22 percent of the world's population, with as little as 7 percent
of the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
However, some gentlemen in the Western countries, turning a
blind eye to this rare achievement, attacked China's human rights
record and put forward anti-China draft resolutions seven times in
succession at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights,
although they failed each time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people hold that the country's development itself
shows that they enjoy more democratic rights. This is because the
Chinese people's greatest and the most pressing demand is to
develop the economy, so that they will be able to fully enjoy the
rights of survival and development and the country will become
strong and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The economic boom is just a result of this demand and an
embodiment of democracy. But Western nations view China an
autocratic country. One popular view in these countries is that
China's economy is developing, but it is not democratic, regarding
China's economic development and democracy as two absolutely
irrelevant things.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people think that China's development has improved
their life and helps secure a stable society. So it is one of the
few periods of times of peace and prosperity in history.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, China's development is also beneficial to the
development of other economies. It can help other nations promote
trade and economic relations with China and create more jobs for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China's development contributes to peace and
stability in the world. However, some gentlemen in Western nations
hold that the more China develops, the stronger its desire for
expansion will be, thus threatening peace and stability of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The conflicting views resulted from different positions and
viewpoints. As far as human rights are concerned, some Western
countries think human rights mean only political rights and they
do not cover economic rights, not to say rights of survival and
development.
</P>
<P>
This may be caused by the fact that some Western nations have
national conditions different from those of China and many other
developing countries. In their minds, food and clothing are not
problems at all. They just don't know this is a question of life
or death in China and other developing countries. So as an old
Chinese saying goes, "The well-fed don't know how the starving
suffer". It means people in different positions have entirely
different feelings and demands.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of political democracy, some Western states think
that democracy means every individual has the right to express
views and to seek interests.
</P>
<P>
However, China holds that an individual's right doesn't mean
everything of democracy although it is indispensable. Democracy
should include the rights to act in accordance with the opinions
and interests of the majority of people.
</P>
<P>
The West usually judges the conditions of democracy in some
countries by the extent of individual rights instead of paying
attention to whether the masses' opinions are accepted and their
demands satisfied.
</P>
<P>
That is why some Western states failed to see that China's
rapid economic development resulted from satisfaction of the
majority people's demands, which is the embodiment of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The West also advocates for their model of multi-party
election, separation of the three powers (the legislative,
executive and judicial powers) and the parliamentary system of two
houses, saying only this is democracy.
</P>
<P>
But, China believes that in view of China's specific
conditions, the People's Congress system can embody more democracy
because China's rapid growth in the past decades is a result of
carrying out the policies, plans and programs approved by the
Chinese People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
It demonstrates that the Chinese People's Congress can
guarantee the demands of the masses of people are truly
satisfied. The Chinese people demand rapid development. The West,
which judges China by its own democratic concept and mode,
naturally can not find the kind of democracy in China it preaches.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of peace and security, the Chinese people, for the
sake of rapid development, badly need a peaceful and friendly
international environment because China is unlikely to develop
without a peaceful and friendly international environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will never be so foolish as to devastate
their development by doing something which will threaten the world
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
However, some Western nations, which are seeking to expand
their sphere of influence, view China's development as a threat to
them. They failed to see the fact that China's speedy development
contributes to the world peace and security, but also. And what is
more, they also failed to realize what sufferings will befall
China and the world's peace and security if China wanes
again.

<P>
First, the rarely vast market of China with an annual trade of
nearly 300 billion U.S. dollars and millions of job opportunities
would be gone, and a wave of millions of Chinese refugees surging
would flow across the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The bitter dispute on human rights between China and some
Western countries involves whether to respect facts, which should
not be based on hearsays.
</P>
<P>
The human rights situation in China should be judged in the
angle of history. It is well-advised to check by comparison
whether it has been improved or worsened than before, and which
are principal, achievements or mistakes.
</P>
<P>
I was born in old China. In my opinion, by comparison between
today and yesterday, China's human rights situation is in heaven
rather than in hell. The right of survival -- the most pressing
and important demand the Chinese people long sought for -- has
been gained and ensured.
</P>
<P>
But, some gentlemen in Western states often rely on isolated
happenings and distorted, exaggerated and even fabricated facts to
make biased comments on China's human rights. This, naturally,
leads to their failure to make a correct judgement matching with
real conditions.
</P>
<P>
As a research institution, we do not intend to cover up the
problems in China's human rights. We acknowledged that the human
rights conditions in China are not satisfactory in many ways, and
some are even serious.
</P>
<P>
The most critical problem is that the Chinese people have not
entirely solved the problem of food and clothing for 58 million
people, who account for five percent of the Chinese
population. And those who have been relieved from poverty are
still not rich enough and capable of tiding over major natural
calamities and disasters.
</P>
<P>
The serious violations of human rights in China, such as
kidnapping and selling women and children, and labor right abuses,
are still taking place in China despite severe crack down by the
law-enforcing departments.
</P>
<P>
The government has made plans to solve the problems before a
fixed date. For instance, the 58 million people living in poverty
now will be helped out of poverty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, we think that the fair estimate on the conditions
of China's human rights should be that great achievements have
been made although there still exist some problems, and efforts
are being made to improve. China's development will make people
enjoy more human rights.
</P>
<P>
It is normal for some countries to have different views on
China's human rights situation because of the different national
conditions. The way to solve the difference is dialogue, which
will help promote the understanding between the two sides.
Confrontation should not be resorted to because it will not help
solve the differences but increase contradictions and disputes.
</P>
<P>
Our current visit is aimed at having dialogues with people from
all corners on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Many of
you may have heard the opinions of just one side, we'd like to
provide you those of another side.
</P>
<P>
We do not ask them to accept our ideas. What we hope is to make
them understand why and on what basis China has taken its position
on human rights.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes Sino-Russian Ties Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Cui Tiankai said today China values its strategic and cooperative
partnership with Russia, hoping to work with Russia to further the
bilateral ties in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Cui told a routine press briefing here that the past several
years have witnessed stable growth of the Sino-Russian relations,
and, in particular, President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to
Russia this April "delivered new progress in the strategic and
cooperative partnership between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who starts an
official visit to China today, will have a wide-ranging and
profound exchange of views on various questions with his Chinese
counterpart Premier Li Peng, including the one concerning bringing
the bilateral trade volume to 20 billion US dollars at the end of
the century, a goal set at their first meeting last December.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin arrived in Shenzhen, a special economic zone in
South China, this morning to start his three-day official visit to
China. It will be the second time the prime ministers of both
countries will hold talks since China and Russia set up a schedule
of regular meetings between the leaders last December.
</P>
<P>
"The trade and economic cooperation between China and Russia is
far from what the strategic and cooperative partnership calls
for," Cui said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, China is optimistic about the realization of
the above goal, because the economies of the two countries are
strongly complementary and the economic cooperation has great
potentials.
</P>
<P>
According to Cui, the two sides will sign some cooperation
agreements during Chernomyrdin's visit to China.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Strikes Deal to Sell Telecom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The German government said today it
will sell 25 percent of its remaining stake in the German telecom
giant Deutsche Telekom in order to meet membership targets for
joining the planned single European currency Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached between the government and the Telekom
today, the shares are to be transferred to the state-owned Bank
for Reconstruction in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to generate 25 billion German marks (14.5
billion U.S. dollars) for the financially strapped government.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that the shares would not be allowed
to be sold on the stock exchange before the year 2000, a promise
made by the government when the Telekom first went public in
November, 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the Telekom would be permitted to offer part of the
shares to "strategic investors" in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer told a general meeting of
shareholders today that the deal would help the company develop as
"a global player on the world market" by increasing its
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Bonn currently holds about 74 percent of the Telekom
shares.

<HEADLINE> Residential Mortgage Market Absorbs More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Substantial amounts of new
finance continued to be channeled into the residential mortgage
market in May, according to the results of the latest survey
conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Gross new loans increased during the month by 14.7 percent to
26 billion HK dollars (3.35 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average size of new loans increased to 1.91 million HK
dollars (246,000 U.S. dollars) compared with 1.77 million HK
dollars (228,000 U.S. dollars) in April.
</P>
<P>
Repayment of loans during May rose at a slower pace than new
loans. The amount of outstanding loans thus increased by 2.7
percent to 371.8 billion HK dollars (47.97 billion U.S. dollars)
in May, compared with a 2.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
The annualized rate of growth of outstanding loans in the three
months to May increased to 30 percent from 29.4 percent in the
three months to April. The average change over the last 12 months
increased to 24.9 percent in May from 23.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
David Carse, deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, said that the
rapid growth in residential mortgage lending in May gives some
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the property market has recently been more
subdued and the HKMA is therefore continuing to evaluate the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Firm to Spend More in Chilean Copper Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian mining giant BHP Co
Ltd said it would spend 161 million US dollars as its share of a
further expansion of the Escondida development in Chile, following
approval from its partners in the copper mine.
</P>
<P>
The mine's partners agreed to a 141 million US dollar project
to optimize and integrate the original processing facility,
completed in 1990, with the subsequent three stages of expansion
completed between 1990 and mid-1996, the Australian Associated
Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The other part of the spending would be a 140 million US dollar
investment in water supply infrastructure, which was also
approved.
</P>
<P>
The latest expansion approval would take BHP's investment in
the mine to approximately 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
BHP Copper's Murray Hohnen said the investment was part of a
strategy to maintain copper production levels from Escondida, as
the new expansion would allow lower grade ore through the mill
without a reduction in copper production.
</P>
<P>
It was a natural attribute of the mine that ore grades would
gradually decline.
</P>
<P>
When completed by the end of 1998, the milling capacity of the
concentrator was expected to be 127,000 tons per day, compared to
a current rate of approximately 105,000 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
The expansion would include more processing equipment such as a
24 by 34 feet ball mill, pebble crushing systems and replacement
concentrate filters at the Coloso port.
</P>
<P>
The Escondida mine yielded 845,000 tons of copper in
concentrate and copper cathode each year.
</P>
<P>
The expansion was approved by the owners of Minera Escondida
Limitada-BHP (57.5 percent), Rio Tinto plc (30 percent), Japanese
consortium JECO (10 percent) and the International Finance
Corporation (2.5 percent).

<P>
HAIKOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, the capital city of south
China's Hainan Province, has lowered land transfer prices to
attract more overseas investment, according to an official
decision.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to fund shortages arising
from dampening enthusiasm for land development by Chinese and
overseas investors after the adoption of macro economic-control
policies in 1994.
</P>
<P>
After the latest readjustment, the transfer price of per mu
land (15 mu equals one ha) will be between 25,000 and 40,000 yuan
(about 3,000-4,800 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Land used for development of public facilities will be
transferred at 60 percent of the unit price, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The prices cover compensations for the land, re-deployment and
the loss of young crops, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
The original land pricing standards in Haikou were formulated
in 1992.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in the
agricultural sector of Haikou, capital of south China's island
province of Hainan, has grown significantly since the start of
this year, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have set up 25 enterprises specializing in
agricultural development and processing agricultural produce and
sideline products, with investment totalling more than 100 million
US dollars, about 41 percent of all overseas investment in the
provincial capital so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the farming sector is now able to claim one of
the highest rates of profit for per unit of cost is a major reason
for overseas investors' increasing interest in agriculture,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
They also note that the farming sector is protected and

<HEADLINE> WB-Aided Power Project under Construction in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank-Financed Beilun
Thermal Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang Province has finished
all the necessary earthwork for its second-phase construction.
</P>
<P>
Installation of the third coal-burning generator and steel
structures for the workshop started this month, and the
installation of the fourth and another workshop will begin in
August, according to an engineer in charge of the construction.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Beilun District of the city of Ningbo, the
Beilun Thermal Power Plant is China's first thermal power project
that is financed by World Bank loans for construction. Major
equipment needed for this project will be put on public bidding.
</P>
<P>
The plant, with an area of 105 hectares, is to be installed
with five 600,000-kw coal-burning generators. The entire project
will be completed in two stages.
</P>
<P>
For the first-phase construction which lasted from January of
1988 to October of 1994, the plant was installed with two
generators, at a cost of 5.55 billion yuan (about 668.67 million
U.S. dollars), of which, 395 million U.S. dollars was covered up
by WB loans. It has generated 23.9 billion kw/hours of electricity
thus far.
</P>
<P>
The engineer told reporters that they would install the
remaining three generators in the second-stage construction which
will entail 12.218 billion yuan (about 1.472 billion U.S. dollars ),
482 million U.S. dollars of which will be met by a loan provided
by WB.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers have also been working against time on
auxiliary facilities since they began the second-stage
construction last June, which include building of a 240-meter-high
chimney, a 188-meter-long water discharge tunnel under the sea,
earthwork for a new coal berth and two 995-meter-long water intake
tunnels under the sea.
</P>
<P>
According to schedule, the second-stage construction will be
completed by the year 2001. The third generator will be connected
to the East China Power Grid and become operational in March of
1999.
</P>
<P>
By then, the power plant will have a combined generating
capacity of three million kw and will be able to generate 20
billion kw/hours of electricity each year.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Article on HK Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today published
a 6,000-word article by its correspondents hailing the impending
Hong Kong handover as a symbol of China's entry into a new era
marked by reunification and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the text, subtitled "150 Years of Disgrace Is
to be Erased," says Hong Kong's history from its cession to return
demonstrates that socialism is the only road of China to national
reunification and prosperity, and that the Chinese Communist Party
is worthy of the title of national hero for its efforts toward
this end
</P>
<P>
The article reviews Chinese modern history, the Opium Wars in
particular, saying that British colonialists' canons and warships
led to the signing of three humiliating treaties which took away
more than 1,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory, including
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty had not the slightest
idea of Britain's geographic location, even after China's
disastrous defeat in the Opium Wars," the article pointed
out. "With such ignorance and self-isolation, how can national
sovereignty be defended and national dignity be preserved?"
</P>
<P>
The article says that imperialists and colonialists could
invade and occupy part of China's territory, but could never
conquer its patriotic spirit.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the century-long struggle of the Chinese people
against imperialism and colonialism, the article says that only
when the banner of patriotism is upheld by the Communist Party of
China, which combines the simple aspiration for national salvation
with the truth of Marxist theory, could the Chinese nation find the
right path to national reunification and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It was late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who proclaimed to the
world that China would resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, and it is the reform and opening-up and growing
economic strength of socialist China that made this possible, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese communists are the most steadfast and thorough
patriots and are worthy of the title of national hero.
</P>
<P>
"July 1: a sacred and meaningful date. It is not just a
coincidence that the date marks the birth of a great party and
also the termination of a humiliating past."

<TEXT>
<P>
The second part of the article points out that the formulation
of the "one country, two systems" concept is a reflection of the
selflessness and breadth of vision as well as steadfastness and
flexibility of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese
government. The great concept led to the solution of a difficult
question left over from the past.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China is of the view that that two
different social systems can seek common ground while reserving
their differences for the sake of fundamental interest of the
country and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The article says the first generation of the Party's leadership
was farsighted enough to see that the reunification of the
motherland could be achieved peacefully. With that vision, the
second generation formed the great concept of "one country, two
systems," and the third generation has put it into practice.
</P>
<P>
The present Party leadership opened a new chapter in Chinese
history by doing a great deal of work for the return of Hong Kong
to the motherland and for its long-term stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, "Hong Kong compatriots will end their
life under colonialism, go back to the embrace of their motherland
and become for the first time masters of their own destiny."
</P>
<P>
It offers the assurance that nothing will change the principle
of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's retaining of the capitalist system and capitalist
lifestyle for 50 years was proposed by Deng Xiaoping. As long as
the Party sticks to its basic lines set by Deng, "there will be no
change, also no reason to make any change, to the principle on
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The Party and central government will employ every possible
means to ensure Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy guaranteed in
the Basic Law, notes the article.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong strengthens the unity of the Chinese
nation. More and more Hong Kong people become aware that their
destiny is closely linked with that of their motherland."
</P>
<P>
The article reiterates the idea of ultimate reunification
between the mainland and Taiwan and predicts that a successful
experimentation of the "one country, two systems" concept in Hong
Kong will have a profound influence on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The reunification and prosperity of the motherland is the
common aspiration of the Chinese nation. Who will refuse to be a
member of a big Chinese family when a strong China emerges on the
horizon in the 21st century?" the article quotes a professor from
Taiwan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the third generation of the Party's
leadership is fully aware that the return of Hong Kong is just the
first step toward the grand goal of reunification, and the smooth
implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems" will
greatly boost that prospect.
</P>
<P>
"To realize the reunification of the country is the national
aspiration. If the reunification will not come about in one
hundred years, it will in one thousand years," the article
concludes, quoting Deng Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Regain Lost Antiquities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian antiquities stolen by a
British antiquities restorer will be sent back to Egypt, the
latest issue of the Egyptian Al Ahram weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts, stolen from the Saqqara necropolis and an
ancient tomb 10 kilometers south of Giza, include a false door of
the tomb, a bronze statue of the falcon god Horus and a statue of
the head of King Amenhotep.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a British court found Jonathan Tokeley-Parry, the
smuggler, guilty of smuggling Egyptian antiquities and sentenced
him to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
However, Tokeley-Parry justified his crime by arguing that
Egypt did not deserve to keep its own heritage because it had
neither the expertise nor the money to preserve it all.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that these treasures would be better preserved in
air-conditioned showcases in private homes than in cash-strapped
museums and stores in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mohamed Saleh, director of the Egyptian
Museum, as saying that there is an unwritten "regulation of
cooperation" between the world's museums, under which a stolen
object which a trader tries to sell to a museum should be returned
to the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
Egyptologists have often demanded a change in British law which
does not penalize anyone who steals artifacts from a foreign
country, as long as the crime was committed outside the UK.
</P>
<P>
Last February, a Cairo court sentenced Tokeley-Parry in
absentia to 15 years hard labor for being part of a 12-man
smuggling ring that include corrupt Egyptian antiquities
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport to Go into Operation Next April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Hong Kong's new
international airport at Chek Lap Kok has been going on smoothly
and the airport will go into service next April as planned,
according to Clinton Leeks, director of corporate development of
the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center today, Clinton Leeks said the south runway of the new
airport will be put into use in April, 1998, while the north
runway, whose construction started last April, will be ready for
use the following November.
</P>
<P>
The new airport on Lantau island east of Hong Kong Island will
be able to handle 35 million passengers and three million tonnes
of cargo a year, Leeks said.
</P>
<P>
The new airport's annual passenger and cargo flow is expected
to reach 87 million persons and nine million tonnes by the year
2004.
</P>
<P>
Rail and highway links, bridges, a cross-sea tunnel and new
town facilities to support the airport are also under
construction, said Leeks, and it will take only 23 minutes to
travel from Central, Hong Kong's business center, to the new
airport by a high-speed train.
</P>
<P>
With shuttle trains and escalators installed in the airport,
according to Leeks, passengers only need 30 minutes to go through
all check-in and check-out procedures.
</P>
<P>
The director said the Airport Authorities are discussing with
airlines and other bodies involved on airport charges which he
revealed will be at a "medium level."
</P>
<P>
Leeks said the name of the new airport will be decided by the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
When the new airport opens to service, he said, the present Kai
Tak Airport will be closed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Sets up Special Committee for Risk Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) has set up an auditing and supervision committee in an
effort to improve internal control, and prevent and ward off
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The committee is the first of its kind established by a
state-owned Chinese bank and is ABC's third specialized committee
following two others for overseeing asset-to-liability management
and credit extension.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that China's commercial banks have been weak at
standardizing their operations, exercising self-restraint and
conducting internal management, which is considered as factors
prone to risks at some financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
ABC's auditing and supervision committee, which is established
on the headquarters' level, will do research and formulate principles
and policies for business operation and risk prevention, draw
annual objectives and medium and long-term plan for risk
examination and evaluation, make decisions of economic punishment
against those accountable for major economic cases and rule
violations, and propose for criminal punishment when necessary.
</P>
<P>
ABC is one of China's big-four state-owned commercial
banks. The other three are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, the Bank of China, and the China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
As China moves to a market economy and accelerates its pace to
turn its banks into real economic entities, risk control has
become overwhelmingly urgent and important.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government's Size Doubled in 26 Years: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The government size of Bangladesh
has doubled since the country won independence in 1971, according
to a World Bank report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The World Development Report 1997 said that the number of
ministries in Bangladesh increased from 21 to 35 in the past 26
years, and between 1990 and 1994 the number of departments and
directorates rose from 109 to 221.
</P>
<P>
Public sector employment increased from 450,000 to an almost
one million in 1992, registering an annual increase of 3.6
percent, compared with the population growth of 2.5 percent each
year during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new ministries, divisions and departments
were created in part to meet emerging needs such as environmental
protection and women's issues.
</P>
<P>
"But the state has also spread its wings into commercial
activities," said the report, adding growth has often been
stimulated by political considerations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the increase in ministries allowed new
ministerial positions to be handed out to more intra-party groups
and, of course, created more low level jobs to be dispensed.
</P>
<P>
Aside from its budgetary effects, this expansion has stretched
implementation capacity, compounded coordination problems, and
made regulation more intrusive, the report said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Resident Mission Chief Pierre Landel-Mils welcomed
the formation of an Administrative Reform Commission with the
capacity of a cabinet minister, saying the appointment sends the
"key signal that it's an important area."
</P>
<P>
Landel-Mills hoped that the commission would be thinking in a
"radical way" for reforming the administration. But, he noted that
it would not be an easy task and called for collective efforts in
this respect.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Move "Closer" to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- As of next year, Beijingers won't
have to dream about voyages in the South China Sea to see
dolphins, man-eating sharks, coral and colorful shells, after the
announcement from Beijing Zoo that a huge aquarium is to be built
there.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Aquarium, expected to cover 35,000 square meters
will not only be China's first marine world, but also the largest
in any of Asia's land-locked cities.
</P>
<P>
The conch-shaped aquarium will provide an underwater home away
from the sea to sharks, whales and another 1,500 marine
creatures. But to ensure more than just the survival of the
fittest, the fish will be divided among one huge "ocean" pool,
containing 2,000 tons of sea water, and 30 smaller "seas", each
holding about 20 tons of water.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be able to watch marine life through large, solid
acrylic panes which provide 99 percent transparency. And they may
also feel just how prickly sea urchins and sea stars are which
will be easy to pick up from a long, open water tank. Meanwhile,
the eccentrics of the sea, dolphins and sea lions, will show off
their playful skills before an audience seated in a 3,000-seat
marina-arena.
</P>
<P>
The aquarium will not only break records for the diversity of
its future tenants -- it is going to shatter glazing records: it
will feature a great "glass" wall measuring ten by six meters and
weighing 23 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to a manager with Beijing Landa Aquarium
Co. Ltd. which is investing US$56 million in the project, the
pane, which is acrylic not glass, is the second biggest in the
world, after one in a San Francisco aquarium.

<HEADLINE> Job Growth's Hopes Given Boost in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of an improved outlook for
employment growth in Australia were given a boost today with an
increase in the number of job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
An Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey found the total
job vacancies rose 2.7 percent, seasonally adjusted, to 63,900 in
the May quarter compared with the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released here today, found the job vacancies were
now 7.7 percent higher than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly increase was solely due to a greater demand for
labor in the private sector, with the public sector job vacancies
falling 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed signs of improvement in today's ABS job
vacancies would be a good guide to the size of an expected pick-up
in the job growth.
</P>
<P>
Last month employment fell by 40,300 in the country, while the
unemployment rate rose to a three-month high of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello told parliament this morning
that a near record number of job vacancies in the May quarter
supported the outlook for stronger employment growth in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would continue to take measures
to reduce the Commonwealth debt, return the budget to surplus and
improve industrial relations.
</P>
<P>
He believed these will create sustainable real jobs in the
private sector and reduce the high unemployment rate in the months
to come.

Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the call in a speech
delivered on June 20 at a forum organized to mark the 76th
anniversary of the founding of CPC.
</P>
<P>
The speech was published in full length in today's "People's
Daily", the leading national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The period between now and the year 2010 is an important one as
China transits from the second stage to the third on its way to
fulfill its strategic goal of socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
"A historical task that lays in front of the whole party is to
hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, seize every opportunities,
and push forward reform, opening-up and modernization drive to a
new era," said the senior Chinese party leader.
</P>
<P>
The tasks under new situations are very urgent, so it is
necessary to improve the quality of party members and to bring their
pioneering and exemplary role into full play, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded that as China's reform and opening-up drive proceed
in depth and socialist market economic mechanisms are being
established in more and more places, party members are now
confronted with an environment and conditions quite different from
those of the past time. Under the new circumstances, party memembers
are required to maintain their progressive character and to play
an exemplary role.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, warned that now a small number of party members have
not survived the tests of new historic changes and lost their
progressive character, or even degenerated so far as to go against
the party and the people.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to brave the problems and to put improvement of
party members top on the work agenda, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese party leader also urged party members to use their
acts to preserve their progressive character, stand in the
forefront of the historic times and to play a pioneering and
exemplary role.
</P>
<P>
While urging party members to keep a close link with the broad
masses of the people and be concerned with the weal and woe of the
people, Hu also called on them to voluntarily resist corrosive
influence of decadent ideology of the exploiting classes and to take
the lead in practicing and publicizing socialist ethics and
healthy habits.
</P>
<P>
He also urged party organizations at various levels to
strengthen education and management on party members and create
conditions for them to fully play a pioneering and exemplary
role.

LA PAZ, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia defeated Mexico 3-1
Wednesday night to qualify for the Copa America final, raising the
hopes to clinch the title for the first time since 1963.
</P>
<P>
The other berth will be contested between Brazil and Peru to be
played in Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
After the victory, soccer fans hit the streets in celebration
as Bolivia kept its slate intact in the Latin America's most
important soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
The game was suspended for nine minutes after the Mexicans
questioned the referee for ruling on one of the goals. And both
coaches, Antonio Lopez of Bolivia and Bora Milutinovic of Mexico,
were thus expelled.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Nicolas Ramirez scored at fourth minute with a free
kick, but the Bolivians turned the match around with goals by
Erwin Sanchez, Ramiro Castillo and Jaime Moreno at 26, 44 and 75

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Take 100 Passengers As Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 heavily armed Muslim
rebels today flagged down two passenger buses along a highway in
the southern Philippines, taking some 100 people on board as
hostages, military reports said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
herded at gunpoints the passengers in the village of Malabuwaya,
Kabacan, North Cotabato province in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
General Arnulfo Acedera, chief-of-staff of the armed forces,
said the hostage taking was the MILF's diversionary tactic to ease
the government's full blown attacks on Rajamuda in North Cotabato,
the MILF's second biggest camp in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We will exert all efforts to keep the hostages free and safe,"
Acedera said.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops surrounded the rebels in the rugged
hills of Kabacan where intense fighting resulted in undetermined
number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Sketchy military reports said the rebels had released 40 people
and left only 60 captives while other unconfirmed reports said
many of the hostages tried to escape during the ensuing battle,
forcing the rebels to shoot and kill two of them.
</P>
<P>
Government troops intensified military operations against the
MILF after some rebels took 43 employees of the Philippine Oil Co.
on June 16. All hostages had been rescued by the military.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides continued their fighting since then.
Earlier reports said that some 100 rebels and five soldiers had
been killed during the ongoing battles.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had threatened to quit peace talks with the government
if the military continues its operations.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Interview: Civil Service Ranks Are Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhou Zongxin
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- "A smooth transition is coming
without any problem and we're all confident of Hong Kong's
future," said Lam Woon-kwong, Hong Kong's Secretary for the Civil
Service in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
After 23 years' service in the govornment and now as head of
the Civil Service Branch, Lam oversees matters concerning the
180,000 people directly employed by the Hong Kong government --
from their employment, promotion, punishment to retirement.
</P>
<P>
Lam has been appointed Secretary for the Civil Service for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) by China's central
government.
</P>
<P>
"The civil servants' ranks are very stable now," Lam said,
citing only four percent of the civil servants having left the
ranks during the past 12 months, which represents the lowest rate
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
"With just days left before the handover, government
departments are operating normally and steadily. The civil
servants at various levels are in a fairly good mental state," Lam
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's highly successful civil service system features
three major characteristics, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The criterion for recruiting new civil servants is that they
should be talented and capable, and their selection is through a
public application process.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's civil servants receive fairly high pay, which works
to guard against corruption and talent drainage.
</P>
<P>
And a highly efficient system and the order of law are adopted
for their management, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Service Branch is the government department
responsible for working out and revising the system, policies and
regulations governing the management of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Lam cited a strict and systematized management network as one
of the three major factors behind the stable status of civil
service ranks.
</P>
<P>
The two other factors are Hong Kong's fast economic progress
during the past decades, which has made possible high pay for
civil servants, and an increased watch-dog function played by
community and media, according to Lam.
</P>
<P>
He said these factors are expected to be further strengthened
after the handover. "The Basic Law has laid down articles with
clear and unequivocal wording on ensuring Hong Kong's civil
service system. As China's economy enjoys prosperity, a bright
future can be foreseen for Hong Kong's development and financial
status in the future," Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"And the Basic Law provides that freedom of speech and of the
press shall be maintained as well. So, to draw a reasonable
inference from all these analyses, we are fairly confident of the
future," said Lam.
</P>
<P>
"From the preparatory process for the establishment of the SAR
government, especially after the appoinment of Tung Chee Hwa as
the SAR's Chief Executive, the central government has given him
full confidence and trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has greatly strengthened our confidence in the principle
of 'One Country, Two Systems' and 'Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong'," Lam added.
</P>
<P>
Lam, who has visited most parts of the Chinese mainland
including Tibet since 1978, encourages his colleagues for such
visits so as to know more about the rest of China. "Seeing is
believing. Our country has changed so fast that you can know this
better and deeper only when you are there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong in 1951, Lam joined the Administrative
Service
in 1974 after graduating from the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Deputy Director of Regional Services in 1989,
Deputy Secretary for Civil Service, Civil Service Branch in 1991,
Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower, Education and
Manpower Branch in 1993 and Director of Education in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lam took up the current post of Secretary for Civil Service in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was married in 1978 but has no children.
</P>
<P>
Lam's hobbies include reading, traveling and movies. He is a
soccer fan but has not watched local competitions since the
retirement of his favorite player Wong Man-wai in the 1980s.
"Hong Kong soccer needs star players," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he manages never to miss World Cup finals, especially
championship finals. He would enjoy both live broadcast and
tape-recorded
programs over and over again.

<HEADLINE> 60 Hostages Freed by Philippine Government Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military today
attacked some armed Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
who took 100 bus passengers as hostage, freeing about 60 of them.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour battle, the rebels fled from a bridge where
they held the hostages.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least one hostage, one rebel and four
soldiers were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, some 150 heavily armed MILF members
stopped two passenger buses along a highway in North Cotabato
province in the southern Philippines, taking all the 100
passengers on board as hostage.
</P>
<P>
General Arnulfo Acedera, chief-of-staff of the armed forces,
said the hostage taking was the MILF's diversionary tactic to ease
the military's full blown attacks on Rajamuda, the MILF's second
biggest stronghold in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said the military still has no plan to stop the
attacks. On the contrary, it is mulling to send more fresh troops
to the areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have been fighting the fiercest battles
against the rebels after 200 MILF rebels took 43 employees of the
Philippine Oil Co. on June 16.
</P>
<P>
All hostages had been successfully rescued by the military. The
two sides, however, continued their fighting since then. Earlier
reports said that some 47 rebels and five soldiers had been killed
during the ongoing operations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF was a breakaway faction of the Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year. With 12,000 armed fighters, the MILF
proclaimed itself the biggest rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
MILF leaders have threatened to walk out of peace talks with
the government if the military operations continue. The two sides
are scheduled to open their sixth round of low-level talks on June
29.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Bank Optimistic with HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The future of Hong Kong as a
business and financial center is bright, according to a report
issued by Standard Chartered Bank recently.
</P>
<P>
K.C. Kwok, chief economist for HK, China and Northeast Asia of
Standard Chartered, was quoted as saying that Hong Kong has gone
from strength to strength during the past 15 years,
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's stock of outward foreign direct investment is
estimated to be the equivalent of 63 percent of its GDP, which is
much higher than the 28 percent for Britain, 16 percent for
Singapore, 10 percent for Taiwan, nine percent for the United
States and six percent for Japan.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that a large number of companies are managing
their investments in China and in the region, with their bases in
Hong Kong, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to note that Hong Kong's economic performance is
strong, and is set to remain so after its return to China,
underpinned by robust consumption and investment, adding that many
business service sectors are doing well and prospects for trade
look encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The growth has been promoted by not only the enormous business
opportunities unleashed by the reforms and development in China's
interior area, but also by the flexibility and entrepreneurial
dynamism of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
With regard to China's development, the report said, many media
reports and comments on China tend to focus on the negative
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the reported noted, since China remains a low-income
developing country with its own historical, cultural and social
peculiarities, one should not be blind to the fact that hundreds
of millions of people in China today are enjoying a level of
material living standard and spiritual freedom unprecedented in
Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Cuts Bank Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- In a significant development,
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday slashed the bank rate
by one percentage point from 11 to 10 percent with immediate
effect, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate is the rate at which the RBI makes money
available to the banking system in the country and any
fluctuations in this rate should reflect in the interest movements
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The RBI decision to cut the bank rate has sent out a signal
that the central bank wants a lower interest rate regime and is
trying to nudge the banking system, now flush with funds, to lend
more freely to business and industry.
</P>
<P>
The move is the first evidence of the central bank living up to
its earlier promise of using this rate as a benchmark for monetary
management.
</P>
<P>
The immediate outcome of the cut in the bank rate would be a
fall in the interest ceiling on domestic term deposits of maturity
between 30 days and one year from 9 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the cost of funds to banks will be lower by 1 percentage
point while these banks will be expected to pass on this benefit
to their borrowers by lowering their lending rates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NZ Budget Lays Stress on Health, Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Winston
Peters delivered his first budget for the country over the next
three years this afternoon, putting emphasis on health and
education.
</P>
<P>
In line with an agreement the National Party and the New
Zealand First party signed last December to form the first
coalition government in the country, health, education and some
other sectors are the major gainers in the budget.
</P>
<P>
"The budget recognizes the importance of social
responsibilities and shows our commitment to delivering on the
Coalition Agreement promises in health, education, employment,
safer communities, the environment, saving for retirement and to
older New Zealanders," Peters stated.
</P>
<P>
The key budget initiatives and the three-year cost of these
initiatives include improving the health and well-being of New
Zealanders at an additional cost of 900 million NZ dollars (one NZ
dollar equals 0.68 U.S. dollars), raising the quality of education
through increased funding of 355 million dollars and removing the
superannuation surcharge at a cost of 554 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The coalition agreement envisages that an extra 5 billion
dollars are needed in the next three years to be spent on priority
areas, most in health, education and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Peters said the government's intention is to stay within the 5
billion dollar limit set out in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1997/98, new spending will total 900 million
dollars, rising to 1.6 billion dollars in 1998/99 and 2.5 billion
dollars in 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that after taking into account new spending
initiatives, and tax cuts in 1998/99, which were announced by the
former government but put off for one year by the coalition, the
government operating surpluses are forecast to rise from 1.5
percent of the GDP in 1997/98 to 2.3 percent in 1999/2000. Over
the same period, net government debt is forecast to fall from 25.5
percent, he added.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Draws New Employment Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
committed over 21.7 million dollars (about 15 million U.S.
dollars) in the current fiscal year to a new employment strategy,
Employment Minister Peter McCardle announced today.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "employment is the pathway to greater
self-reliance," he said the government's employment policy will
focus on attacking long-term unemployment and expanding work
experience and training opportunities for job seekers.
</P>
<P>
He described the investment as a "down-payment" on the full
implementation of a new employment strategy next year.
</P>
<P>
"This year's commitment is not simply about spending additional
money, but also about using current resources more effectively."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that of the total, over 10 million dollars
will be used to significantly increase the number of job seekers
involved in community work, with a goal of building up to 10,000
long-term job seekers at any one time undertaking projects of
benefit to the community that will not otherwise be undertaken.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- With regard to the establishment
of institutions in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), the Basic Law follows the spirit of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and takes into consideration the
characteristics of the political system of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the spirit of the Joint Declaration, no
changes will be made unless such changes are necessary, and no
changes will be made if such changes are undesirable.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, good elements in the existing institutions will be
either assimilated or retained.
</P>
<P>
Given the characteristics of the political system of the HKSAR,
there will be neither a complete copying of the names of existing
institutions, nor a duplication of the people's congress,
procuratorate and judicial systems, nor a patterning after the
administrative structure in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The most important institutions of the HKSAR are the Chief
Executive, the Government, the Legislative Council and the Court
of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are the Executive Council as well as the
Commission Against Corruption and the Commission of Audit, both of
which will work independently and are accountable to the Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
Under the HKSAR Government will be a department of
administration, a department of finance, a department of justice
and various bureaus, divisions and commissions.

<HEADLINE> hkhk -Hong Kong-related Data (14):Preparatory Committee for HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is a working
body empowered by the National People Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Its main task is to make preparations for the establishment of
the first government, legislature and other organs of the HKSAR in
accordance with the Basic Law and relevant decisions of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the NPC on the Methods for the Formation of the
First Government and Legislative Council of the HKSAR adopted by
the Third Session of the Seventh NPC on April 4, 1990, stipulated
that the NPC will set up a Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR
within 1996, which will take charge of matters concerning the
preparations for the establishment of the HKSAR and decide in
accordance with this Decision on the specific methods for the
formation of the first Government and Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee was set up in January 1996 with 150
members and with Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as
its chairman. Among the 150 committee members, 56, or about 37
percent, are from the inland area, and 94, or 63 percent, are from
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
So far, the committee has held nine plenary meetings and 40
panel meetings, and accomplished the following seven jobs:
</P>
<P>
-- Forming a Selection Committee consisting of 400 permanent
residents of Hong Kong;
</P>
<P>
-- Electing the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
-- Electing the 60-member Provisional Legislative Council;
</P>
<P>
-- Raising a proposal after systematic studies that most of
Hong Kong's existing laws should be retained intact;
</P>
<P>
-- Doing research and raising proposals on a series of
important economic issues concerning the smooth transfer of Hong
Kong's political power, such as the compilation of the budget for
97/98 fiscal year, monetary stability, transfer of government
assets, and large-scale infrastructure projects;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting the establishment of the Committee for Celebration
of Hong Kong's Return to the Motherland in Hong Kong to prepare a
variety of non-governmental activities; and
</P>
<P>
-- Formulating the specific method for the formation of the
first legislative council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the ninth plenary meeting, the
Preparatory Committee has basically completed its task. Since the
Preparatory Committee is a body set up by the NPC, the question of
ceasing its work is up to the Standing Committee of the NPC to
decide.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand coalition
government reconfirmed today its commitment to retaining the six
strategic assets listed in an agreement on forming the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In a joint speech in the parliament, Finance Minister Bill
Birch and State Owned Enterprises (SOE) Minister Jenny Shipley
said the coalition agreement is the first time in the 10-year
history of SOEs that the government has made a clear statement
that a specified group of assets will not be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, who are the SOEs' government shareholders,
said however that the government will take steps to ensure the six
SOEs listed in the agreement will be managed as efficiently as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"This includes ensuring that each SOE has a fully commercial
capital structure and does not retain funds that could be better
used elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
The government will ask each SOE Board to ensure that its SOE
has an appropriate capital structure, including a debt-to-equity
ratio at least as high as that of comparable private sector
entities.
</P>
<P>
The six SOEs listed as strategic assets are the NZ Energy
Corporation, the Contact Energy company, the Trans Power company,
New Zealand Post, TV One and Radio New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Output Expected to Touch Record in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The production of foodgrains in
India is estimated to reach 198.17 million tons this year (from
July 1996 to June 1997) with indications that the wheat output
will be the highest ever at 68.71 million tons, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Agriculture Ministry, which released the statistics
on Wednesday, had in April estimated that foodgrains production
would be 192.12 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry has revised the estimate upward following
indications that the wheat output, earlier forecast to be 64.66
million tons, might touch 68.71 million tons on the basis of the
latest production data sent in by the states in which wheat is
grown.
</P>
<P>
The previous highest wheat production of 65.77 million tons was
achieved in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
India has suffered from a shortage in wheat supplies since last
year and imported millions of tons of wheat from other countries
to meet the demand of domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Indian
Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra said there would be no need
to import wheat this year to help sustain the public distribution
system in the country.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the government would not hesitate to import
foodgrains if the trade manipulated the market prices of wheat
beyond reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government had taken note of warnings of
a few international scientists that warming of Pacific ocean
waters due to the El Nino phenomenon could adversely affect
monsoon rainfall in India.

more similar zones will be set up in the Wa area in northern Shan
State under a three-year project and emphasis have been put on
ending the cultivation of opium poppy and marijuana in Kachin
special regions since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He also said Myanmar plans to take part in a meeting among
Myanmar, Thailand and Laos in Laos and another six-nation meeting
in Thailand concerning drug control.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also cooperating with neighboring countries like
Thailand, Laos, China, India and Bangladesh and with the Russian
Federation and Vietnam, having signed bilateral agreements with
them, he added.
</P>
<P>
With a view to joining the common fight against narcotic drugs
in the region, Myanmar handed over to the Thai authorities

<P>
MANAGUA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Breeding frogs could become a new
business option soon in Nicaragua, says a Salvadoran expert.
</P>
<P>
Jose Trinidad Benitez made the prediction at the first seminar
in the country on raising frogs, which opened here Tuesday and was
sponsored by the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry and the
International Regional Organization of Plant and Animal Health.
</P>
<P>
Benitez said the main reason for raising frogs was for export
for hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
At present, the market price of frog legs for export is seven
U.S. dollars a pound.
</P>
<P>
In his country, Benitez said, companies had been able to ship
up to 1000 pounds a month of the profitable legs to the United
States, where they were appreciated as a delicious food, tastier
and with more protein than fish and chicken.
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador and Guatemala, which are experienced in breeding
batrachia, frog legs are on the menus of four and five star
restaurants. Many Europeans and Asians also eat frog legs.

<HEADLINE> Three Suspected Child Lifters Lynched in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of agitated people on
Wednesday torched a police van, roasting two suspected child
lifters in it and beat another to death at the North Badda area in
Bangladesh's capital city, Dhaka, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in a month that suspected kidnappers and
thieves were lynched around Dhaka by mass beating. Just a month
ago, six cattle thieves were beaten to death in Demra County,
dozens of kilometers southeast of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
During the violent clashes on Wednesday, another person was
shot dead and 18 policemen were injured when police tried to
rescue the three suspected child lifters from the wrath of the
mob.
</P>
<P>
The mob torched the van when police snatched the three severely
beaten alleged child lifters from the mob and took them on to the
van. However, one of the victims was dragged out of the van and
beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
Police said they fired 31 shots and 34 tear gas shells to bring
the riotous mob under control and arrested 25 people from the spot
during and after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Rafiqul Islam later told the parliament that some
people might have provoked the lynching. He sought cooperation
from all political parties in maintaining law and order.
Otherwise, he said, innocent people might fall victim.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged people not to take the law into their
own hands, but hand over suspects to police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
accused the government and its law-enforcing agencies of failing
to remove the panic created among the people across the country
over the child-lifting incident.
</P>
<P>
"The incident proves that the people have lost their confidence
in the law-enforcing agencies," BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
said in a statement.

<P>
The new party would be in opposition in parliament, but it
would not oppose decisions of the government. The party would
endorse an alliance, mainly with other parties whose policies were
similar to the SDPR.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu said, he would be the leader of the new party. Its
spokesman would be Iosif Boda, who was former party member of the
SDPR, and former Romanian Ambassador to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Another Senator, Sergiu Nicolaescu, the famous film director,
announced that he would withdraw from the RSDP at the news
conference, and leave the political arena to return to movies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Srpska has urged
the United Nations stablizing force in the country to stop U.S.
soldiers in the force from provoking Serb policemen.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Dragan Kijac, in a letter to Multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) Commander William Grouch, said
U.S. soldiers, especially those in the Brcko region, often stirred
up conflict with Serb policemen in a very rude manner.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Kijac
criticized U.S. soldiers for flaunting weapons and military
technology and humiliating his ministry's members "in an inhuman
and uncivilized way," which violated the republic's constitution,
laws and the terms set in the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kijac urged Grouch to take all measures to stop U.S. soldiers
from making provocation, warning that if U.S. soldiers did not
stop such activities, his ministry would be forced to sever all
contact with SFOR troops in Brcko.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China is
positive and Hong Kong will continue to be a big window to the
international market, Panamanian Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto
Arias said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after announcing that Panama will open a
trade office in Hong Kong after the Chinese government resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between Panama and China last year,
Panama would replace its current general consulate office in Hong
Kong with the Economic and Trade Office.
</P>
<P>
The office is a provisional government office, which will have
the faculty to provide consular services apart from continuing to
provide traditional merchant marine services, Alberto Arias said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the office will also be in charge of promoting
trade, economic, cultural and tourist exchanges between Panama and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the expiration of the trade office in six months,
Panama and China will negotiate and establish a permanent status
of the Panamanian office, the foreign minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investment in the
Futian bonded zone of Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south
China, has grown rapidly since the start of this year, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four Hong Kong-funded enterprises were registered in
Futian between January and May, with registered capital totaling
312 million Hong Kong dollars, up 160 percent over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Funds from Hong Kong have accounted for nearly 70 percent of
all overseas investment in the bonded zone, which added up to 2.4
billion Hong Kong dollars by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
As overseas capital rushes in, imports and exports in the
bonded zone have surged, reaching 541 million US dollars last
year, or more than double the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
A zone official said that the growth momentum is able to be
sustained this year, with exports and imports expected to reach
1.78 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bonded zone, designed to become a comprehensive free trade
zone, will play an important role in economic development in
Shenzhen, a city official noted.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the zone's gross domestic product would reach
10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars) by the year 2000
while imports and exports would hit six billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the country's
largest bank, will transfer its credit business in foreign
exchange to its grassroots subsidiaries as of July 1, according to
a bank decision.
</P>
<P>
The bank's international business department, which until now
has been in charge of the foreign exchange credit business, will
mainly be responsible for the administration of foreign exchange
loans beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the decision to transfer the foreign exchange
credit business down to the grassroots subsidiaries is an
important step taken by ICBC Shanghai to meet the need of banking
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
The latest measure will be helpful in preventing risks related
to the extension of loans in foreign exchange, the analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
Covered by the decision are loans for technical renovation,
marginal loans for overseas-funded enterprises, packing loans,
loans for circulating funds, and loans already agreed to but not
extended.
</P>
<P>
The value of loans falling within the perimeters of the
decision accounts for 75 percent of all loans from the bank's
international business department, according to bank estimates.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A Nepalese parliamentary
delegation is currently in Sri Lanka seeking to recruit doctors
from the country for hospitals in Nepal where there is a shortage
of medical doctors, according to Health Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which met Deputy Minister of Health and
Indigenous Medicine S. B. Nawinna, had discussions on the details
of the matter and Nepalese students studying medicine at Sri
Lanka's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Mutual exchange of knowledge of indigenous medicine and the
import of ayurvedic raw materials and herbal plants to Sri Lanka
from Nepal were also discussed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At present Sri Lanka has an excess of doctors and is unable to
provide employment for all of them at government hospitals. If the
doctors are to get jobs at Nepalese hospitals, the problem would
be considerably eased for the Sri Lankan government, the sources
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Confirms Russian Fighters Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas has confirmed that his country will soon buy Russian-made
fighter jets following the decision to cancel the purchase of nine
F-16 fighters from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We've made up our mind. But this does not mean we have any
problems with the United States," the minister said here
Wednesday after opening a seminar on Indonesia-Egypt relations,
sources at the seminar disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia earlier this month canceled its planned purchase of
nine U.S. F-16s citing "wholly unjustified criticisms" of
Indonesia in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that President Soeharto has assigned
chairman of the national development planning body Ginandjar
Kartasasmita to go to Russia to make the deal.
</P>
<P>
Alatas stressed that Indonesia's refusal to purchase the F-16s
from the United States will not sour relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kartasasmita said last week that the Indonesian Armed Forces
are quite familiar with Russian military equipment. In the 1960s,
the Soviet Union was Indonesia's main supplier of military
equipment, including MIG fighters, wide-bodied Antonovs and tanks.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Decides to Maintain Oil Production Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations agreed today to maintain the
current official production ceiling of 25.03 million barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of OPEC, Rilwanu Lukman, told reporters that
the ministerial meeting of OPEC decided that all 11 member
countries would keep the group's production quotas in the second
half of this year, with no changes in quotas of member countries.
</P>
<P>
Local observers estimated that OPEC production now stands at
two million barrels a day above its ceiling of 25.03 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the oil average price has dropped from
25 U.S. dollars a barrel to the present level of about 18 dollars
a barrel, well below the group's target of 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened here today and will end on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian News Agency APA said that most of the member
countries agreed to maintain the group's current official ceiling,
while Saudi Arabia and Iran hoped OPEC member countries would
abide by their allotment. However, Venezuela, reportedly the
biggest overproducer, demanded an extension, even lift the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Rasheed said his country would get back
into the export market within 10 days in accordance with the
United Nations conditions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been banned from most oil exporting since it invaded
Kuwait, another OPEC member country, in 1991. The UN has now
agreed to allow Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food
and drugs for its people.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Lukman said Iraq's return to the market could
not influence oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The organization's members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Water Supply - A Long Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Guess what answer you might get
when you ask a group of Hong Kong kids where fresh water comes
from.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall," one says. "From the reservoir I visited last
summer," another cuts in. But you shouldn't feel amused if a third
offers: "Simply from the tap!"
</P>
<P>
After all, they are kids, too little to know what a long way
fresh water has come into their life.
</P>
<P>
The older generations, however, will never forget the story of
water, which makes an important part of Hong Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
For most of the past 150-odd years, the city suffered severe
water shortages due to the lack of natural resources -- lakes,
rivers or substantial underground water.
</P>
<P>
Healthy but erratic rainfall, which averages 2,214 millimeters
a year, had been the major source of water supply till the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
In the century up to the 1960s, one Hong Kong governor after
another seemed to share the same perspective that rain water alone
would be able to meet the needs of the people as long as enough
reservoirs were built.
</P>
<P>
In 1860 when Governor Hercules Robinson was in office, work on
Hong Kong's first public water scheme -- Pok Fu Lam Reservoir --
was started. Its supplies began to reach the city at the end of
1863, and that was the year Hong Kong first had its tap water.
</P>
<P>
But, upon completion, the scheme, with a capacity of only 9,000
cubic meters, proved hopelessly inadequate for the then nearly
100,000 population.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many bigger reservoirs were constructed in the
following years throughout Hong Kong, such as Tai Tam Tuk
Reservoir, Aberdeen Lower Reservoir, Shing Mun Reservoir and Shek
Pik Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, none of them managed to catch up with the rising
population and the ever-increasing demand for water, particularly
in case of drought.
</P>
<P>
"Up to late 1967, restricted water supply was the rule rather
than the exception," said a government fact sheet.
</P>
<P>
In 1895 when a drought hit Hong Kong, there was only daytime
water supply.
</P>
<P>
In 1902 the supply was cut to one hour a day and water was
brought from the Pearl River by boat.
</P>
<P>
When a severe drought visited the city in 1929, compartments of
trains running between Kowloon and Guangdong were transformed into
tanks to bring water from Shenzhen River.
</P>
<P>
Then came the year 1963, a nightmare to most of middle-aged
Hong Kongers. Supply was restricted to four hours every four days.
</P>
<P>
Many factories were forced to shut down, leaving tens of
thousands of people jobless overnight.
</P>
<P>
The 3 million people were plunged into dire straits. A
photographer recorded the pitiful scene: an endless queue of empty
buckets on the street awaiting a refill with anxious women
standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
A large fleet of chartered tankers transported water from the
Pearl River to feed the thirsty city.
</P>
<P>
It was the 1963 drought that led to the construction of the
well-known Dongjiang-Shenzhen water project on the mainland, which
proved to be the best solution to Hong Kong's water problem.
</P>
<P>
The then Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, approved the project,
allocating some 36 million yuan RMB!!(4.6 million U.S. dollars)
out of the state coffers at a time when China's economy was
experiencing a hard time.
</P>
<P>
With the project completed at the beginning of 1965 after 11
months of work, water was extracted from Dongjiang, or the East
River, at a point some 83 kilometers north of Hong Kong, pumped
over a series of dams and eventually discharged into the Shenzhen
Reservoir before being fed by pipeline across the border to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
After so many years of suffering from the water shortage and
restricted supply, Hong Kong finally saw a gleam of hope.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the water project has been
expanded three times, with its capacity growing from 68 million
cubic meters to over 700 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that in 1986 water from Dongjiang made up about 52
percent of Hong Kong's demand. In 1996, the ratio was raised to
over 70 percent with the annual supply hitting 720 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people benefit a lot from the project -- at least a
shower every day is guaranteed, while visitors and tourists have
the chance to enjoy a variety of artificial fountains and
waterfalls in parks and in front of high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
As Director of Water Supplies Hui Man-shiu said, water coming
from Dongjiang is the origin of Hong Kong's vitality.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Palace Allegedly Backs Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential Palace
helped a pro-charter change group advocate constitutional
amendment to allow a second term for President Fidel Ramos, the
Manila Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mike Policarpio, executive director of the
People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA),
as saying the palace was instrumental in helping the group hurdle
obstacles that stood in the way of its signature campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The Ramos administration has been effective in removing some
stumbling blocks we have faced and are facing because it
recognized there are these 6 million signatures and there is a
clear chance for people's initiative to push for charter changes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the PIRMA tried its third chance by submitting to
the Commission on Elections 6 million signatures it collected.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had twice foiled the PIRMA's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Policarpio's remarks came after Budget Secretary Salvador
Enriquez announced that President Ramos was interested in seeking
a second term but was "too shy to say it."
</P>
<P>
Enriquez also revealed that six cabinet members, including
himself, have signed in the PIRMA petition.
</P>
<P>
However, Policarpio refused to say how the palace helped PIRMA.
He also denied the palace was "using the group" to extend the term
of the president.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Jointly Develop Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar are likely to
join hands in developing a special economic zone in Myanmar's
Myawaddy Province, which borders Thailand's Tak Province.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has confirmed its support for the
establishment of the economic zone to facilitate the relocation of
Thai labor-intensive industries to Myanmar, the Thai Prime
Minister's Office Minister Veerakorn Kamprakob said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai labor-intensive industries, like garment and shoe
manufacturing, will relocate their production bases from Thailand
to the zone to utilize the cheap labor in Myanmar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that the labor cost in Myawaddy was
only 16 baht per day, much lower than the minimum daily wages of
between 128 and 157 baht (5.12-5.28 U.S. dollars) in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials also believed that the establishment of such an
industrial estate will help solve the illegal foreign labor
problems in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government hoped to bring its laborers back from
Thailand by establishing the zone, Veerakorn said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Warns Bidding Cities Against Commercialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic chiefs have warned the five
cities bidding to host the 2004 Summer Games that the
commercialism which sparked huge controversy at last year's
Atlanta Olympics must disappear for good.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee (IOC) marketing director
Michael Payne said on Wednesday the issue was a key part of a
Tuesday meeting which the IOC held with the bidding cities --
Rome, Athens, Buenos Aires, Cape Town and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta was heavily criticised for commercial excesses, which
had almost made the Games look like a huge flea market.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has a number of official sponsors and rules about how
the Olympic Games can be used in advertising.
</P>
<P>
Last year the organisation said it would be tightening its
rules on commercialism and would not give the Games to cities in
the future unless they agreed with its marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
Payne said Sydney, which hosts the next Summer Games in the
year 2000, had already introduced even tougher rules on
commercialism than the IOC requires.

<P>
PRAGUE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The 14th International Workshop on
the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ends
here today after intensified discussion on political and security
issues, military cooperation and alliance's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar began last weekend. Presidents, prime
ministers and foreign and defense ministers from 15 NATO member
states and its Partnership for Peace Program also discussed how to
strengthen political dialogue between NATO and Partnership for
Peace states.
</P>
<P>
Russian ambassador to NATO Vitalij Curkin reiterated Russia's
opposition against NATO's eastward expansion. He said European
security would be less assured after NATO's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu again expressed his wish
that Romania should be in the first of the new group to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Romania would be very disappointed if it failed to participate
in NATO in its first wave of eastward expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
United States Under Secretary of Defense John White said his
country firmly supports the entry of the Czech Republic, Poland
and Hungary into NATO in the first wave of the alliance expansion
as the three nations were qualified to join the military
alliance.

<P>
LISBON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The scientific committee of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) introduced a "Science
for Peace" program today, which aims to help the integration of
East European countries into NATO's scientific projects.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in Cascais, near Lisbon, Portuguese Science and
Technology Minister Mariano Gago said the program will foster
scientific development in those countries and promote world
stability within a climate of dialogue and cooperation.

programs in Portugal, Greece and Turkey, and narrowing scientific
and technological gaps between these countries and more developed
members of the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the program, hundreds of Portuguese researchers were
provided with scholarships for doctorate studies.
</P>
<P>
Science for Peace and Science for Stability programs are
designed only for research for peaceful purposes.

<HEADLINE> Cable Across "Roof of World" to Be Constructed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China has started construction of
a 2,754-kilometer fiber optic cable across "roof of the world",
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) announced
here Wednesday that the cable will link Lanzhou, capital of
northwest China's Gansu Province, with Xining of Qinghai Province
and Lhasa of Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the cable system has started in Qinghai
Wednesday, and it will become operational in December 1998,
costing 610 million yuan (73.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The cable system will be the world's most difficult fiber
optical project in terms of construction condition," said a report
in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
About 840 km of the cable will be 4,500 meters above sea level
or even higher, where oxygen in the air is 50 percent less than
places like Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Construction will only be possible there from late spring to
early September, when windstorms and snowstorms are not frequent.
</P>
<P>
A MPT official said after completion, the cable system is
expected to provide 21,330 long-distance telecom circuits and
therefore greatly help improve the telecommunication capacities of
northwest and southwest China and Tibet in particular, a big boost
to local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is the only province-level region without
cross-provincial fiber optic cable links. This cable system is
part of plans to aid Tibet launched by the central government for
the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou-Xining-Lhasa cable system is one of 23 major fiber
optical cables which MPT plans to build by the year 2000. These 23
cables will connect all Chinese provincial capitals and major
cities and greatly upgrade China's telecommunications capacities
when completed.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Wins Again in Paris Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian world and Olympic
champion Donovan Bailey once again stamped superiority on the
international sprinting arena by scoring a commanding victory in
the 100 meters at the Paris Grand Prix on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bailey brushed aside the drizzle and wicked conditions to win
the dash in 10.07 seconds, Americans Tim Montgomery and Brian
Lewis came second and third in 10.12 and 10.19 seconds
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the man who set up a 150-meter showdown with the
Canadian on June 1 for the fastest-man-in-the-world title suffered
a humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson crashed to his first 400 meters defeat for
eight years when the world and Olympic 200m and 400m champion
could only finished fifth in 45.76. Fellow American Antonio
Pettigrew won the race in a time of 44.86 seconds in damp weather.
</P>
<P>
Another disappoinment was local favourite Marie-Jose Perec.
The women's 200 and 400 meters Olympic champion dampened her fans'
heart by coming in a poor seventh in 200m race which was took by
Inger Miller of the United States in a time of 22.48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In other performances worth mentioning, Namibia's Frankie
Fredericks, second to Johnson and Bailey respectively in the
Olympic 100 and 200 meters, took the 200 easily by 20.38, while
in-form American Bryan Bronson postered 48.15 to win the 400
meters hurdles.
</P>
<P>
The constant drizzle made world record attempts very
difficult. Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie ran well short of his own
5,000 mark when he clocked 13 minutes 1.51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj beat his Algerian rival Nourredine
Morceli in a stirring 1,500 meters, winning three minutes 31.87
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Denmark-born 800m Olympic champion Wilson Kipketer
confirmed his already authorized territory by taking the title
with 1.44.03.

<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Defender Ibrahim Hassan has been
banned for life from Egypt's national team and suspended for a
year from domestic competition for making obscene gestures at
Moroccan fans during last weekend's African Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
The punishment was ordered by the Egyptian Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, 30, was the veteran of Egypt's 1990 World Cup
campaign. He had already been suspended for six months by his
Cairo club al-Ahli and fined 10,000 pounds (3,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the obscene gesture at Moroccan fans after Egypt
conceded a second-half goal to Morocco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Egypt to 0-3-1 and third place in qualifying
Group Three with three points, five behind group leaders Morocco
and Senegal with only two matches to play.
</P>
<P>
Only the top two teams in each group advance to next J in
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Egypt already has been eliminated from qualifying for the 1998
World Cup.

CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Small Business Minister Geoff Prosser last night
faced the most serious allegations of promoting his private
business interests after he was accused of making a telephone call
to "curry favor" with a Bunbury councilor about a retail
development. The fresh charges came after a week of unremitting
attack on the minister from the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly one in three adult Australians is primarily dependent
on welfare and 41 percent of children under 15 live in low-income
families, a study has found.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The federal Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are
pushing for a plebiscite on whether Australia should become a
republic, following the likely collapse of the constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- One of Australia's largest and most influential unions, the
Australian Workers Union, is in serious financial trouble after

secretary.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM on Relations Between Russia, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said there is great potentiality in cooperation
between Russian and China.
</P>
<P>
He said that his upcoming visit to China, scheduled for June
26-28, would add specific contents to the strategic cooperative
partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference attended by Russian reporters and
those from Xinhua and China's People's Daily, Chernomyrdin said
high-level exchanges between Russia and China have laid basis for
the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the China visit by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin last year and Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
Russia in April this year are of great importance.
</P>
<P>
During Yeltsin's visit to China, the two leaders agreed to
establish a mechanism of holding regular meetings between the
prime ministers of the two countries, which was started by Chinese
Premier Li Peng's Russia visit in December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said this mechanism is aimed at fully expanding bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence in developing economic and trade
cooperation between Russia and China, he noticed that their
bilateral trade grew by 25 percent last year, a rate much higher
than that between China and its other trade partners.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China share increasing interest in the
cooperation in production, investment, joint management, science
and technology, crafts and training.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China this month, he said, he would meet
Premier Li Peng on cooperation in infrastructure, energy,
transport linking Russia and China, as well as regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin viewed Hong Kong's return to China as
an important historic event for China and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised the concept of "one country, two systems" by
Deng Xiaoping, saying that Hong Kong's return to China is in line
with the basic interest of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Hong Kong industrial and commercial circles
would cooperate with Russia on the basis of mutual benefit and
make contributions to improving economic and trade ties between
Russia and China.

<HEADLINE> Seles, Novotna Cruise into Wimbledon Second Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Monica Seles and
third seed Jana Novotna defeated their opponents here on Wednesday
with the other scheduled clashes simply being washed away by the
consistent rainfalls at the Wimbledon Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav-born tough girl dominiated the whole match and
gave her nervous Australian opponent little hope of turning the
tide. Although the rain intervened at the crucial second set,
Seles ran away with a convincing straight sets victory 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The world number four tennis player condeded that her serve
remains a shadow of its former self since she ended her two-year
absence from the tennis world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the ideal physical shape I would like to be. I'm
trying to improve it," she told reporters after her easy victory.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Novotna met fierce resistance from German Wiltrud Probst,
dropped the second set before the Czech veteran displayed powerful
tennis at the decider to snatch the victory 6-4, 4-6, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
"She was playing really well and hit a lot of winners. The
second set was the best she has ever played against me," Novotna
said.
</P>
<P>
The other 77 scheduled matches would have to be carried over to
Thursday, but the wet forecast for the rest of the week is almost
bad omen to both players and thousands of tennis fans.

<HEADLINE> North Urged to Change Pattern of Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the 19th special session of the General
Assembly, Venezuelan Environment Minister Rafael Martinez-Monro
said that patterns of of production and consumption in developed
countries must change.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the world's population consumed 75 percent of
its resources and produced 95 percent of its waste. The link
between population and development must be profoundly
recognized. The current special session of the assembly should
adopt an ambitious and broad-ranging plan of action, but that
plan should be backed up by serious international cooperation,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that rapid
industrialization of the developed countries, coupled with their
unsustainable patterns of consumption, have had an irreversible
destructive impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
Given their role in environmental degradation in the past two
centuries, and their current access to environmentally sound
technologies and financial resources, developed countries bore
the legal and moral responsibility, he said.

consumption in developed countries, together with poverty and
underdevelopment in the developing world, were the predominant
sources of environmental degradation.

Representatives from small island countries also urged the
international community to curb the emission of carbon dioxide

<HEADLINE> Albright Starts Southeast Asia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Madeleine Albright left for
Hanoi today in her first trip to Southeast Asia since she became
the U.S. secretary of state this year.
</P>
<P>
"She's going to work on the relationship, try to advance our
relations with one of the more important countries in Southeast
Asia," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Albright will explore progress in accounting for U.S.
servicemen missing in the Vietnam War, a key issue in bilateral
ties, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Vietnamese authorities are trying to account for more
than 1,500 U.S. servicemen listed as missing in action during the
Vietnam War, which ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state will also discuss economic relations and
broader political issues when she meets Vietnamese officials,
Burns added.
</P>
<P>
After her visit to Vietnam, Albright will go on to Cambodia
according to the original schedule, but officials here have
indicated this looks less likely than before because of security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
If she cancels the Cambodia trip, Albright still has a chance
for a visit in late July when she attends an Association of
Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Albright's last leg of her trip will be Hong Kong, where she
will attend a ceremony on July 1 for the return of the city to
China after more than 150 years of colonial rule by Britain.

<HEADLINE> Philips Announces Audio CD Recorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch electronics company
Philips today announced the development of a new CD audio recorder
that will allow consumers to create their own CDs.
</P>
<P>
Philips said in a press release that the CD-recorder will plug
easily into any existing home audio system and allows users to
record from all analogue or digital audio sources.
</P>
<P>
The new recorder offers consumers the ability to create and
play CD-quality recordings and is fully compatible with the
existing Audio CD format.
</P>
<P>
Philips said that its new CD-recorder will include various
agreements made worldwide on copy protections like SCMS, the
Serial Copy Management System.
</P>
<P>
"The ability to make your own Audio CDs has been something of a
Holy Grail among consumers," said Doug Dunn, chairman and CEO of
Philips Sound &AMP; Vision.
</P>
<P>
"Now consumers can easily create their own recordings, with the
quality and convenience of a Compact Disc. The recordings made by
consumers can be played back on the CD equipment they already own
for home, portable and in-car use. The present installed base of
CD Audio player already exceeds 500 million worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philips CD-Recorder is currently the only audio recorder
which is compatible with both CD-Recordable and CD-ReWritable
media.
</P>
<P>
CD-Recordable discs can be "written once," meaning that a disc
can be created only once. These discs can then be player on any CD
Audio player.
</P>
<P>
CD-ReWritable discs can be "written and rewritten," meaning
that tracks can be erased and re-recorded as needed, several
hundred times. These CD-ReWritable discs will not play on existing
CD-Audio players.
</P>
<P>
Philips said that it will make its future CD Audio players
compatible with CD-ReWritable discs starting in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that the introduction of the CD-Recorder will
be towards the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998 in Europe for
an estimated street price of 1,500 Dutch florin (some 773 U.S.
dollars). Other regions will follow shortly, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Two of Germany's leading economic
research institutes said today that they have seen some signs of
improvement for the German economy.
</P>
<P>
The IFO Institute for Economic Studies in Munich said in its
latest economic report that economic prospects had improved
slightly, with the outlook in eastern Germany clearly getting
better, the German news agency DPA reported today.

According to IFO, the automotive and electronics industries in
western Germany were benefiting from an upswing in demand. But the
machinery sector was less than satisfied.
