RANGERS TIE BRUINS, 3-3

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although he has been a Ranger for only a few months,
John MacLean enjoyed a dignitary's treatment Friday night before
his team played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. His new
teammates presented him with a silver stick, in honor of MacLean's
having played 1,000 games, most of them with the Devils, over 15
National Hockey League seasons. A player who seems to smile more
than most people, MacLean showed joy on his face and maybe a little
moisture in his eyes when greeted on the ice by family members to
the polite applause from the capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game began, MacLean showed why he has stayed in the
league for so long and why the Rangers signed him to a three-year,
$7.2-million contract last summer as a free agent. He scored twice
_ once on the power play, once at even strength. That was the happy
part of a game that ended with disappointment for the Rangers. They
squandered a 3-1 lead in the final seven minutes of regulation time
and settled for a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Sundstrom got the other Ranger goal, also on the power
play, in an interesting and well-played match. Kyle MacLaren, Steve
Heinze and Dmitri Khristich scored for Boston. Khristich got his
with a deflection from in front with 1:02 remaining in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the late fade, it was an encouraging performance for the
Rangers, who got an effective effort from their three top lines.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing well was another right wing, Aleksei Kovalev, who
assisted on one goal, set up another and put several shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins led by 1-0 after one period, but the Rangers led by
2-1 after two. Scoring the game's first goal was McLaren, on the
power play, at 16:01, beating Mike Richter on a big rebound near
the crease after a long shot by Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied it, also on the power play, at 13:23 of the
second. MacLean got credit for the goal after Brian Leetch's shot
hit both MacLean and and Don Sweeney before getting past Byron
Dafoe, the Boston goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 2-1 lead at even strength at 16:31 on
MacLean's second of the night and sixth of the season. During an
aggressive shift by his line, MacLean took a left-to-right pass
from Leetch and wristed the puck from the inside edge of the left
circle. Although he did not get an assist on the play, Kevin
Stevens was instrumental in the goal because he delivered a hard
check to start the play and continued by going to the slot to take
up space and create havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sundstrom's third-period goal, the Rangers got
several effective shifts from him and his linemates Wayne Gretzky
and Kovalev. Kovalev, playing his second game since returning from
a shoulder injury, was back on the right wing, after centering the
fourth line in the previous game. He worked the right point on some
power-play shifts and created the play on MacLean's first goal by
carrying the puck into the Boston zone.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harvey, usually the most rambunctious of Rangers, threw
many hard hits, particularly early in the game.

NORMAN WITHIN STIKING DISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ The Shark is back, seemingly hungry
enough to take his first bite of his own tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman, coming off a seven-month layoff following shoulder
surgery, teamed with Steve Elkington to shoot 5-under-par 67 on
Friday and stay within two strokes of the lead in the 10th annual
Franklin Templeton Shark Shootoout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have the old man back,'' said Elkington. ``And he
played well. He's driving well. It's almost like he hadn't been
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who has taken gracious hosting to the extreme by never
winning this two-man team event, combined with Elkington for six
birdies to keep front-runners John Daly/Fuzzy Zoeller (65) and
Costantino Rocca/Scott Hoch (66) within reach after the first of
three rounds at Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very successful day,'' summed Norman, who rated his comeback
round ``a two fat ladies'' (8.8) on a scale of 10 in regard to his
expectations. ``I wouldn't say I was nervous, I wouldn't say I was
anxious, but I was anticipating the first shot _ I wanted to get
off to a solid start and it happened that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman and Elkington birdied two of their first three holes to
help ease whatever anxiety might have been naturally creeping up on
the Shark, who found April surgery necessary after his left
shoulder started popping out of joint on backswings during the
Masters Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's long drive helped his team birdie the second hole, and
he later blasted out of a greenside bunker to within three feet of
the cup to set up another birdie on No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't holding back,'' Elkington said. ``He was hitting
balls as far as (1994 PGA Tour driving leader) Davis Love III
(playing in the same foursome).''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he wasn't sure what to expect, but Elkington wasn't
surprised by the strong showing of his Australian mate, despite the
long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Greg Norman 20 years, and I've never seen him not
prepared to play in a tournament,'' Elkington said. ``I didn't
expect anything less than what he did today.''
</P>
<P>
   What Norman did concluded with a near-six-foot downhill birdie
putt on the 18th green, an accomplishment that reminded him of how
much he missed competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to make a putt like that, whether it's for a birdie or
par... I looked up at Tony Navarro (his caddie) and said `That's
what I've missed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While much interest revolved around Norman's much-anticipated
comeback, Zoeller and long-hitting Daly were quietly forging the
best round of the day. Their bogeyless round was spiced by seven
birdies and Daly's massive, 390-yard drive on the 537-yard, par-5
16th.
</P>
<P>
   If they had a slip, it was on No. 16, where Zoeller's second
shot landed in a greenside bunker and the leaders could do no
better than par.
</P>
<P>
   But their alternate-stroke total of 65 has been bettered just
three times in the past four Shark Shootouts. It left the
Daly/Zoeller entry in good position entering today's better-ball
play _ when Zoeller will likely drive for placement to free his
six-time tour driving champion partner for gripping and ripping.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strategy they practiced during Friday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hit it straight and let John swing away,'' Zoeller
said of Daly, whose 1997 driving average of 302 yards was the best
in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the field, Zoeller and Daly were mostly happy
just to have survived the first round without disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win this crazy tournament in one day but you could
lose it,'' said Zoeller, echoing the field in calling
alternate-stroke the most difficult of the three playing formats.

ANTI-CLINTON EDITORIAL PUTS RESERVES MAJOR IN HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wrote an editorial for the ``Washington Times'' this week
advocating President Clinton's impeachment, calling Clinton a
``known criminal,'' ``lying draft dodger'' and an ``instinctively
anti-American man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Marine Forces Reserve is investigating the author,
reserve Maj. Daniel J. Rabil of Chandler, Ariz., whose pointed
prose could lead to his removal from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could be a big flap about nothing if Rabil wrote the
piece on his own time and not the military's, said Maj. Paula
Buckley, spokeswoman for the commanding officer of the Marine
reserves in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil did not answer telephone calls to his home Friday seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed comments raise an interesting issue about freedom of
speech and military reservists, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
officers on active duty are prohibited from making critical remarks
of some elected officials, including the president. The code does
not apply to enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   But the key for harsh disciplinary measures is whether Rabil,
who works for a Valley marketing firm, wrote the editorial during
the one weekend a month he is assigned to his reserve unit in Camp
Pendleton, Calif., Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified colonel in the Marine reserves was appointed to
review the case after publication of the editorial Monday in the
``Washington Times,'' Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil minced no words about the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't make an atheist pope and you don't keep a corrupt
security risk as commander in chief,'' Rabil wrote, describing
Clinton as a ``highly skilled perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we trust in the integrity of directives given by a
president who violates the same basic oath we take? Should we be
asked to follow a morally defective leader with a demonstrated
disregard for his troops? The answer is no,'' Rabil wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to one part of special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report describing a tryst between Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky while the president discussed Bosnia with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil's punishment, Buckley said, could range from counseling by
superiors to being ushered out of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil received his active-duty commission in the Marines in 1986
and served in that capacity until joining the reserves four years
later, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a Marine major who called President Clinton
``an adulterous liar'' in a column in the publication ``Navy
Times'' was given a verbal and written warning from a superior.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Shane Sellers, who works at the Defense Intelligence
Agency, received ``verbal counseling and a non-punitive letter of
caution,'' said a Marine official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine Corps spokeswoman, Maj. Rose-Ann Sgriguoli, confirmed
that an administrative action was taken in the matter, but declined
to confirm the substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was handled administratively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken Thursday by Brig. Gen. Frances C. Wilson,
commanding general of the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va., who
had responsibility for the matter, Sgriguoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers works at the Defense Intelligence Agency, the military's
equivalent of the CIA. &QL;

L.A. STILL KINGPIN OF CONGESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Congratulations, Los Angeles, you're still No. 1
-- in traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   For the 16th year in a row, this car-crazed city nabbed the top
spot for the nation's worst gridlock, according to a Texas
Transportation Institute study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, a trip that should take 20 minutes actually
takes slightly more than 30 during rush hour, and the average
Angeleno spends 76 hours in traffic delays, costing $1,205 each
year. By comparison with 69 other communities studied, the same
trip in Boulder, Colo., took just 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles generally is in the top three of every measure we
look at,'' said David Schrank, a transportation researcher who
co-wrote the study. ``Los Angeles is spread out over a very wide
area, and it's trying to provide a reasonable amount of mobility
spread out over that area, and that's a very difficult thing to.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, Los Angeles earned a roadway congestion
index score of 1.57 in 1996, the latest year for which figures were
available. Washington, D.C., and Miami-Hialeah, Fla., ranked second
and third with scores of 1.43 and 1.34, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And the city with least amount of traffic? Bakersfield, with an
index score of 0.68.
</P>
<P>
   A score above 1 indicates an ``undesirable congestion level'' on
roadways. The index considers such factors as traffic volume and
the number of freeway and major street lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sacks described his daily commute as hellish. He wakes up
every day at 5 a.m. in order to get to work by 6. His 23-mile trek
can take him up to an hour to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad,'' said Sacks, who admits he often has to plan
his life around Los Angeles traffic. ``Sometimes you may want to
visit family and you just can't. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any good news, it is that Los Angeles roadway
congestion eased during the early 1990s, mostly because of the
recession. But now gridlock is expected to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the economy begins to pick up again, traffic volume will
increase again,'' Schrank said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics reveal the troubling trend.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles placed second behind Washington, D.C., for the
amount of time wasted per driver each year in gridlock. Traffic
delays cost the average Angeleno 76 hours a year, up from 64 in
1990 and 41 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also ended up in a three-way tie for worst rush-hour
traffic. A 20-minute midday trip takes 30.2 minutes during rush
hour in Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Reynolds described his daily commute as a ``strategic
chess game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know when to try the freeway and when to stick to
the streets, where the hot spots are and at what times,'' he said.
``It takes up more of my thinking than it should.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Angelenos begin to use alternative transportation, such
as car pools and buses, gridlock is not expected to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be sitting in congestion; it just won't be confined to
rush hour,'' warned Margie Tiritilli, a spokeswoman for the
California Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an array of traffic-busting solutions, from car-pool
lanes to light rail, commuters refuse to abandon their
steel-and-rubber steeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is trying to get people to get out of their cars
and carpool,'' Tiritilli said. ``It's convenient to have your own
car, but it makes it a little bit difficult for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep building more freeways; that's not the solution.
We have to make more effective use of what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Club of Southern California, which represents 4.5
million motorists, espouses what it calls a balanced approach to
solving the region's traffic woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in public transportation such as bus and rail, and
we believe in `flex time' traveling -- always trying to avoid
congestion,'' said Carol Thorp, spokeswoman for the agency.
``There's no magic bullet. It's just by trying a combination of
efforts to arrive at something that's most convenient for those who
have to commute.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, officials already have begun
taking steps to entice employees out of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a national award-winning commuter transportation
program, the company has increased from 2,000 to 8,000 the number
of workers using alternative transportation -- bicycles, car pools,
trains and buses -- during a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of the program is to integrate our environmental
business policy with how people live,'' Disney spokeswoman Claudia
Peters said.

ELKINGTON SAYS FIRST ROUND IS KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Steve Elkington, who has won the Shark
Shootout twice, said playing well in the first round _ difficult
because the alternate-stroke format disrupts rhythm _ is the key to
having any chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a good round today,'' he said Friday, ``and
be in the last group on Sunday because it's so hard to make up
strokes (in final-round scramble format).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost impossible'' might better describe the challenge for
players trying to gain ground Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, then-defending champions Jay Haas and Tom Kite
combined to shoot 16 under par in the final round _ and finished
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Descending champs!off! Twelve months ago, Bruce Lietzke and UCLA
alumnus Scott McCarron were taking bows as the ninth championship
team in Shark Shootout history.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation and three bogeys took their toll on that pair Friday,
when the defending champs opened the three-round event at even-par
72 to place 11th in a field expanded to 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   That placement would have left them off the board in last year's
10-team field, which the Lietzke/McCarron team won with a 30-under,
three-round total of 186. They opened with a 68 in alternate-stroke
format, then 59 in both best-ball and scramble to edge David Duval
and Scott Hoch by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-am champs: Tournament host Greg Norman may have yet to win
his own tournament, but he and fellow pro Costantino Rocca helped
the amateur team of Peter Jones, James Bradford, Bob Dineen and
Michael Price place first in this week's two-day pro-am tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The group was fifth with Norman at 52.9 after the first round of
the handicap-based competition and posted a tournament-leading 54
with Rocca in the second round to finish more than three strokes
ahead of the field at 106.9.
</P>
<P>
   Up and at 'em: Today's round of best-ball play will start at 7
a.m., with the teams of Lietzke/McCarron and Mark
Calcavecchia/Andrew Magee earning the first early-risers tee time
with a combined 1-over-par effort Friday, when neither team broke
par.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament leaders John Daly and Fuzzy Zoeller will join
Costantino Rocca and Scott Hoch in the final group at 7:50.
Elkington and tournament host Greg Norman tee off at 7:40 with
Billy Andrade and Jay Haas.

DEPORTATIONS TO HURRICANE-HIT COUNTRIES SUSPENDED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As four Central American countries struggle to
recover from the catastrophe of Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton
administration plans to make it easier for people from those
countries who are already in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced on Friday
that it had suspended the deportation of aliens from El Salvador
and Nicaragua ``as a humanitarian response to the catastrophic
damage'' caused by the hurricane. On Thursday, the agency made a
similar announcement about aliens from Guatemala and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary suspension of deportations will be in effect until
Nov. 23, the agency said, when the situation will be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary change would allow people who are in the United
States from those countries, both legally and illegally, to remain
here and work without fear of deportation, at least for the time
being. Similar privileges have been granted to people from nations
torn by violence in Eastern Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials were careful to discourage any notion that
the hurricane-related change, the details of which are still being
worked out, would mean an open invitation to people from those
countries to stay in the United States permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the change is to avoid further suffering by forcing
people to return to homelands where destruction, poverty and threat
of disease await them, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely vehicle for extending the stays of people who
might otherwise face deportation is a provision of law known as
``temporary protected status,'' which allows the attorney general
to determine that foreign nationals can remain in this country
because of dangers in their homelands due to conflict or
environmental disaster.

ROSA'S HEADACHES REMAIN A PROBLEM

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The symptoms of post-concussion syndrome that
wrecked right wing Pavel Rosa's season a year ago appear to have
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, a 21-year-old sniper from the Czech Republic who is
considered one of the top prospects in the Los Angeles Kings'
organization, said Friday he has been suffering from headaches for
two weeks, though he didn't seek medical help until several days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings _ who play host to Carolina tonight _ assigned Rosa to
the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs at the end of training camp. Rosa had
three goals and 10 points in 13 games for the Ice Dogs, but was
unable to play Thursday night in their most recent game. He was
scheduled for an appointment Friday with Dr. Michael Mellman, one
of the Kings' physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' said Rosa, who participated in non-contact
drills with the Ice Dogs on Friday and acknowledged a
``light-headed'' feeling. ``I've had big headaches every day,
headaches all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa was chosen by the Kings in the second round of the 1995
draft. Two years ago, he had 63 goals and 153 points for Hull in
the Quebec Major Junior League. Last year, he was given a
legitimate shot at making the Kings' roster, but suffered a
concussion during an exhibition game against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Much later in the season, when symptoms persisted, an
examination revealed an inner-ear disorder that responded to
medication, and Rosa appeared in two games for the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion and inner-ear problems seemed to be behind Rosa
until a couple of weeks ago. The return of his symptoms, however,
has left him understandably frustrated, and when he'll be able to
play again _ and continue his pursuit of a spot with the Kings _ is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   He fantasized briefly Friday about a solution for his
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rosa, ``I would just unscrew my head and put another one
(on).''
</P>
<P>
   Following through: Coach Larry Robinson has been frustrated by
the tendency of some players to play longer shifts than they
should. Friday, in the aftermath of Thursday's dismal loss to
expansion Nashville, Robinson had those players skate longer shifts
in practice. Among those receiving the lesson were Luc Robitaille,
Olli Jokinen, Steve Duchesne, Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make a point,'' Robinson said. ``I've been
talking since the start of the year about long shifts. I was trying
to say (in practice), `This is what it's like. Your legs burn, and
your tongue drags.' (Long shifts kill) you for the rest of the
game. You don't recover. Lactic acid builds up in your legs, and
you don't get that lactic acid out of your system.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The Kings assigned checking forward Dan Bylsma to
the Ice Dogs on Friday, a week after recalling him from Long
Beach.... The Kings may activate winger Sandy Moger and defenseman
Mark Visheau in time for tonight's game. Moger has been sidelined
about 10 days with a strained back, and Visheau has been out six
weeks with a broken hand. If Visheau plays, it will be his second
NHL game and his first since 1993-94, when he was with the Winnipeg
Jets.

GOV. HULL PROCLAIMS AZ BIBLE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gov. Jane Hull has let it be written: Bible Week,
relegated to purgatory in the town of Gilbert, will be observed
this month throughout Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Hull signed the state up Nov. 5, her eyes apparently cast away
from the objections set forth this month by the American Civil
Liberties Union when Gilbert attempted to proclaim Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   The state's proclamation for the week of Nov. 22-29 is pretty
much a chapter-and-verse copy of the one Gilbert is prepared to
pass Tuesday. The ACLU has vowed to take the town to court.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was in Mexico on Friday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But her press secretary, Francie Noyes, said that state
officials did not know of the fury surrounding the Bible Week
proclamation until they read about the ACLU's legal threat in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was new to us,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the Bible has been, and is one of the key documents
in Western civilization and Western moral tradition and we believe
it is worth studying. It is by no means the only such document.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU could not be reached late Friday to say whether it
would sue the state.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said proclamations are issued for most non-profit groups
who request one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do try to do these things when people ask us to, if it
seems to be a reasonable request,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said a state proclamation is not a commandment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a recommendation of what they do. It's not binding on
anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state received the request Oct. 26 from the National Bible
Association, Noyes said. It was signed the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's and Arizona's proclamations mirror each other, both
using the language supplied by the National Bible Association.
Arizona's includes a paragraph, deleted from Gilbert's decree,
which reads: ``Whereas this annual emphasis has helped to
strengthen spiritual understanding throughout our Nation by
encouraging personal reading and study of the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Mayor Cynthia Dunham agreed to remove that paragraph
from Gilbert's proclamation this year, as part of an attempt to
appease the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based group, National Bible Association, has
celebrated National Bible Week since 1941, according to its Web
site. That year, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, issued a
presidential message, and other presidents since have done the
same, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   The association could not be reached for comment Friday to say
how many other states and cities have officially proclaimed Bible
Week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the mayors of Scottsdale, Tempe and Gilbert agreed to
do so, and sent civil-rights activists buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale and Tempe never again made an official proclamation.
But Gilbert continued.
</P>
<P>
   This year was the first time the ACLU threatened legal action
against the town.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dunham agreed to pull the proclamation from the
agenda, at the request of the ACLU, but vowed to pass it the next
week. &QL;

Offer to Caminiti upped by Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   All signs point to Ken Caminiti's becoming an Astro again by
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, the Astros improved their offer to the free-agent
third baseman Friday, and the two sides moved closer to reaching an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the Astros' new proposal could be worth
$15 million over three years. That's a $4.5 million increase over
the Astros' original offer. The deal would guarantee Caminiti $8
million for two seasons and give him a chance to make an additional
$1 million each year with easy-to-reach incentives, assuming he
stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The holdup seems to be the third-year club option, which also
calls for Caminiti to make $4 million, plus a possible $1 million
in incentives. The Astros are reluctant to guarantee the third
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the option year appears to be a stumbling block, it
doesn't seem to have deal-killing potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some things we're trying to do,'' Caminiti
said. ``But we're pretty close _ real close. I feel good about the
way things are going, and I'm happy that they're getting excited
about me. I think we'll be able to get this done next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, 35, and his agent are scheduled to meet with Astros
owner Drayton McLane Jr. and general manager Gerry Hunsicker early
next week. Signing Caminiti most likely will end Sean Berry's
three-year tenure in Houston. Berry also is a free agent, and he
would appear expendable on a roster that included Caminiti and Bill
Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sign Caminiti, I'd have to think I'm probably out of
there,'' Berry said from his offseason home in Southern California.
``I've heard a lot about him wanting to come back to Houston. He's
a great player. I'd just have to find work elsewhere. I'm just up
in the air right now, but I haven't given up yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be a happy day if I had to leave Houston, but if
it happens, there's nothing I can do about it. I feel like the
handwriting is on the wall, but until I hear from Gerry or Drayton,
I'm going to keep hanging in there. The (for sale) sign isn't in
front of my house (in Houston) yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made an offer to Berry before they started courting
Caminiti, but apparently it wasn't good enough to get Berry's name
on the dotted line. San Diego, Kansas City, Seattle and the Chicago
White Sox are among the teams that have expressed interest in
Berry, who hit .314 with 13 homers and 52 RBIs in 102 games in
1998.

Dream alive for Biggio, pal Caminiti
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti began the dream the way most sweet
baseball dreams begin.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the road. Somewhere in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   There they were on so many hot summer nights in 1988, young and
bright-eyed with everything in front of them. The Tucson Toros gear
was socked safely away under the bus. The dream no doubt was stored
away, too, racing through their thoughts as they cramped into small
seats and tried to get some rest before reaching the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   They slung their legs across the aisle over armrests and craned
their necks against windows. The nights got long, the muscles
tired, and everything was altogether uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a dream riding on those buses. There was a bond
formed, and somehow it all just seemed right. Worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Here were a couple of talented kids thinking about what might
lie on the road ahead, when they might share the grandest stage of
all. They might open bottles of champagne, spray them into the air
and bounce around like kids.
</P>
<P>
   Here were a couple of guys, one of them married just months
earlier, the other soon to be, wondering if there ever would be a
day when they could reach the dream together, laugh about it with
their wives and children, and reminisce about when they were pups
riding all those uncomfortable buses.
</P>
<P>
   Something happened all those years ago. A bond they knew time
would not erase. Refreshingly, it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, Cammy became my best friend in baseball,''
Biggio said. ``It's something that goes back a long, long way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something that makes the reunion of Biggio and Caminiti, a
pair of veterans still chasing the dream, one that should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti declined to accept $21.5 million from the Detroit
Tigers this week, basically turning his back on all but one
major-league team: the Astros. He did it for the same reasons
Biggio turned down free-agent offers from the Rockies, Mets,
Yankees and Cardinals three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bond. And the dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he wants to be here,'' Biggio said. ``We
played in the minors together and had those years with the Astros.
That means something.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when NBA players refuse to play for an average of $2.6
million per year and athletes in every professional sport are here
today, gone tomorrow, it means there still is a sense of allegiance
and relationship in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti and Biggio have money. Plenty of it. They want
something else. They were here all those distant days ago and want
to be here again tomorrow chasing the dream.
</P>
<P>
   This goes beyond dollars, which is why the Astros must find a
way to sign Caminiti even if they seem to have all the leverage in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Astros do not. Would you want to be Drayton
McLane Jr. or Gerry Hunsicker and tell this former Most Valuable
Player who wants to play for you, tell your team, your city and
your franchise players _ Biggio and Jeff Bagwell _ that it just
couldn't be worked out?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance to spend time with a guy in the minors
like that, then come up with him, those are the good things about
baseball,'' Biggio said. ``It's just like what Bags and I have
developed here. It's a relationship that means something. It's the
good times and the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Caminiti's wanting to be here to see what is ahead on what
now is a much shorter road. What does he have left? One year? Two?
Three? How many more years can Biggio throw his body around a
baseball field like a kid in a sandbox?
</P>
<P>
   These are players who want to finish what they started, where
they started. You're right, Bidge. That means something.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio has shown how much he wants to finish it here. Caminiti
left millions on the table, and now the Astros simply must find a
way.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the risks _ age and Caminiti's history of
injuries. But Biggio, who not only is this team's field general but
also its field general manager of sorts, has made calls to McLane
and pleaded the case for one more dip into the payroll wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be very creative when it comes to dollars,'' Biggio
said. ``When something like this comes along, you have to try to
work it out. (McLane) knows my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane also knows a World Series championship is within reach
and a new stadium is on the way. A lineup that could include up to
four legitimate MVP candidates _ Biggio, Bagwell, Caminiti and
Moises Alou _ would sell tickets, win hearts and win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point in your life when it's just important to be
home, to be with your family, spend time with the kids,'' Biggio
said. ``It's a stage in life you don't want to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like this opportunity facing the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought last year was special,'' Biggio said, ``this
could be something really, really great. With Cammy here, maybe
we'll get our pitching straight, get back to where we were, and
finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somewhere on the road ahead, they'll open bottles of
champagne, spray them into the air and bounce around like kids. It
would make it all seem so sweet. Worth it.

FOX SPORTS NET SIGNS HEAVY HITTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two more coveted free agents signed rich, new contracts this
week, and their latest employer immediately suggested they could
tip the competitive balance in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell and Greg Colbrunn?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again, broadcasting breath.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Meyers and, especially, Keith Olbermann will bring viewers
with them to their new jobs at Fox Sports Net because of their star
power and talent. More important, they'll bring added credibility
to an operation that has been playing Red Sox to ESPN's Yankees in
terms of content and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net's second-city status can be attributed partly to
its relative newness. The network has only been around for two
years, hardly enough time to build an airtight, top-to-bottom
schedule of quality programming, or to hire the best talent to
deliver it. ESPN has had 19 years to create sports broadcasting's
greatest franchise.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Olbermann and Meyers will help close the
talent gap that exists between Fox Sports Net (Fox Sports Southwest
in Fort Worth-Dallas) and ESPN. Their abilities will improve the
quality of the nightly Fox Sports News show Olbermann will
co-anchor (in competition with ``SportsCenter'') and the weekly
``Goin' Deep'' sports magazine show with Meyers as host. Both will
have other duties as well, as Fox seeks to maximize its investment.
</P>
<P>
   Television being what it is _ a celebrity-driven vehicle _ you
can't underestimate the value of the two signings. Fox thought it
high enough that it will pay Olbermann, who had been host of a news
program at MSNBC, and Meyers, who was anchoring ESPN's ``Up Close''
show, more than $1 million combined annually.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said this week that program content is still the key to
attracting viewers. But, he added, the key to holding them is to
have on-air personalities who viewers like, respect and find
entertaining. History suggests both Olbermann and Meyers fit those
three requirements, and that can only help Fox's fledgling regional
sports network.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect ESPN to suddenly fade to black, though.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Disney-owned property still dominates in
the ratings. ESPN also boasts a far deeper pool of on-air talent
than Fox, depth that allowed it to withstand the loss of Olbermann
when he bolted in a huff for MSNBC last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for nothing that the letters ESPN have almost come to
stand for ``Every Sports Program Needed.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you really can't find every sports event you'd ever want to
watch on ESPN. But if you had to hunker down, remote in hand, with
one network over all others, ESPN would be the one, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Fox folks weren't exactly predicting the demise of ESPN last
week, yet Meyers suggested of his old bosses in Bristol, Conn., ``I
know they're concerned. They can't downplay that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, as did Olbermann, stated that Fox Sports Net in just a
couple of short years had accomplished what it took ESPN a decade
and change to do.
</P>
<P>
   So there was this word of caution from Meyers about his old
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good place to work,'' Meyers said last week.
``\RBut\S I sensed an attitude from management at ESPN that we were
all replaceable. I think they need to be careful or they'll be
replaced as the leader in sports.''

STUDENT PROTEST IN INDONESIA EXPLODES IN VIOLENCE, AND 8 ARE
KILLED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new death toll, refinements)   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Students, thugs and soldiers fought pitched
battles in the streets of Jakarta on Friday night, as Parliament
adopted decrees intended to nudge this suffering nation toward a
more democratic future. It was the worst violence since President
Suharto resigned last May.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight people were killed and scores were injured as
well-ordered soldiers and riot police fired volley after volley
above and directly into throngs of demonstrators and into the
grounds of a university.
</P>
<P>
   For hours on Friday night, as the Parliament voted to hold
general elections next spring and to begin reforms, the streets
were filled with shouts and screams, gunfire and the sting of tear
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Angry students and local residents massed again Saturday morning
in protest of the night's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Like the students whose protests helped bring down Suharto, the
people throwing rocks and gasoline bombs were pressing, with the
passion of the young, for immediate, if vaguely defined, changes.
These appear to include a faster pace toward democracy, the
withdrawal of the military from its dominant role in politics and a
government investigation of Suharto's wealth. But unlike those
earlier protesters, their demand that Suharto's successor,
President B.J. Habibie, step down immediately was less
representative of the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the violence of the streets and the country's
painfully shrinking economy, Indonesia seems in the past six months
to have settled on a tentative course toward reforms on which both
the government and its opposition generally agree.
</P>
<P>
   But the fury over political change and economic upheaval on both
sides of the battle Friday night showed the depth of anger Suharto
left behind him in the country he built but also ruined in his 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The volleys of gunfire Friday night set off rattling echoes on
the glass walls of tall office buildings that, along with the
violence itself, are among Suharto's legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, small white ambulances with flashing red
lights drove in and out of the university grounds as the fighting
surged around them. Many of the casualties had gunshot wounds, but
it was unclear if these were inflicted by live ammunition or by
rubber bullets, which can be fatal at close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for my country,'' said Eky, a student journalist
who like many Indonesians uses one name. ``This is brutal, too
brutal. I don't understand why the military is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no clear explanation for the harsh tactics of the
security forces. Jakarta was full of rumors of a possible coup by
the military and opposition politicians who might use the protests
as pretext.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the students, joined by young men from nearby
slums, seemed driven by an unslaked anger over the abuses of the
Suharto years and an impatience with the deliberate pace of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The young thugs had their reasons, too. ``Everybody hates the
police,'' said Andri, 17, who had just thrown a plastic bottle of
water toward the police lines. ``I see the police as a cruel person
and I hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat watching the demonstrators Friday night said:
``They are sick of being poor. They are sick of being at the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is notable, he said, that the students are essentially
leaderless and that even the newly assertive democratic opposition
no longer shares their urgency for change.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral outline presented to Parliament by Habibie suits
both those in power today and those who hope to gain it in the
future. The students, with their vague demands for immediate
change, have been left to shout and throw stones in the streets
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of their passions and potential violence may have
helped push the Parliament toward reforms, but the decrees enacted
Friday night were modest.
</P>
<P>
   A vote is to be held next year for an electoral assembly that
will name a new president at the end of 1999. The military's
powerful role in politics is to be phased out, but only gradually.
And past corruption, including that of Suharto, is to be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that democracy is dawning, the parliamentary decrees
were issued Friday night with the first contested votes in more
than three decades. At one point, one of the parties staged a brief
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   But still, as in the Suharto years, the work of the Parliament
was carried out in something of a political vacuum, insulated from
the turmoil of the streets outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly under orders to keep the demonstrators far away, the
military stood in mass formations along the roads leading to the
Parliament building. When the session ended near midnight, scores
of delegates were stranded in the area, unable to cross the battle
lines to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Though the demands voiced by various student groups vary, Friday
night's parliamentary decrees failed to satisfy many of them, and
the possibility of further violence hung over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives of the students and the tactics of the
military, the latest violence moved far beyond the realm of policy
or politics and became a visceral struggle between enraged
demonstrators and enraged soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are crazy now,'' a plainclothes security officer
muttered to a reporter. ``Maybe because since the afternoon they
have nothing to eat. And the police are the same. They have gone
crazy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gunfire, foreign diplomats paced the streets with
cellular phones to their ears, reporting the action to their
embassies. They said they were angered and shocked by what they
were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the game?'' said one of them. ``What's the objective of
this military operation? To wound the students? The kids are inside
the campus now. The shooting should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, six truckloads of riot police officers drove along
the white iron fence that surrounds Atmajaya Catholic University,
standing and firing their weapons from the back.
</P>
<P>
   The officers jumped from their trucks and began running and
shooting among the bushes by the side of the university. One turned
and shot an Indonesian journalist in the back. His colleagues
carried him to an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the police, in their heavy, padded helmets, formed a
tight line only 30 yards from the university's fence and began
firing point-blank into its grounds from behind their tall plastic
shields. Some broke ranks to hurl back rocks that the students had
thrown at them.
</P>
<P>
   An officer stood behind them with a megaphone, directing their
fire.
</P>
<P>
   From inside the campus grounds came a constant and extraordinary
roar of animal rage: shouts, yelps, snarls and inarticulate cries,
along with the sound of smashing glass and a relentless banging of
sticks and stones against iron railings.
</P>
<P>
   In the main foyer, dozens of casualties were laid out on the
floor and medical workers performed surgery without anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts, it's hot!'' moaned a young student named Imelda, who
had a gunshot wound to her inner thigh. ``Jesus Christ, help me, I
don't want to die!''
</P>
<P>
   Other students shouted and wept in shock and anger and fear.
They washed their faces with wet rags to clear away the tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They ran to the iron fence and shouted at the soldiers: ``You
are killers! You are dogs!''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, on a street lined with the banks and office towers that
symbolize the prosperity brought by Suharto, as many as 10,000
demonstrators surged and taunted the military. They leaped up and
down in the light of burning gasoline bombs, running forward
occasionally to hurl stones and then retreat.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted, ``Killers! Killers!''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers chased some of them into an alley and an officer
shouted after them: ``Whoever doesn't live here, please go home. Go
home! But if you want to take us on, please, come ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the midst of this, at just about the hour the
parliamentary session ended, a police officer walked into the
no-man's land outside the university's gate. He stood amid the
rubble of stones and bits of brick, and offered a truce over a
megaphone. A student ran from the gate and embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more poured out, shouting, leaping, uncertain whether
to fight or cheer. They, too, embraced the startled riot police,
some trying to kiss them through their heavy visors. ``Thank you!
Thank you!'' one young man shouted over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began over whether the students would be allowed to
march to the now-empty Parliament building. A light rain began to
fall. In a widening circle, students and police lowered themselves
to the ground in the thin yellow light of the street lamps. They
sat together and after a while they began to sing the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said on Friday it ``deeply
regrets that peaceful demonstrations focused on the People's
Consultative Assembly turned violent'' and urged calm.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
still planned to visit Indonesia next week after attending a summit
meeting of Pacific Rim leaders, including President Clinton, in
Malaysia.

STARS' EARLY BARRAGE SINKS RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Maybe it was the No. 13. Maybe it was the blessing of
Sister Eileen Marie Hunter. Maybe the Stars actually were out to
make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one night, the Stars' Joe Louis Arena jinx was
lifted. After winning once in their past 20 games in Detroit
(1-17-2), the Stars smashed the odds, scoring seven seconds into
the game and four times in the first period to cruise to a 5-1
victory against the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win we needed and wanted,'' Stars defenseman Craig
Ludwig said. ``But it was just one win.''
</P>
<P>
   But what a win it was. Playing their 13th game of the season on
Friday the 13th and wearing their third jersey for the 13th time in
franchise history, the Stars decided bad luck wouldn't have
anything to do with their performance.
</P>
<P>
   The opening seven seconds was testament to that. Center Joe
Nieuwendyk, who has won 73 percent of his faceoffs this season,
lost the opening draw to the Red Wings' Kris Draper _ a seemingly
bad sign. But instead of retreating, Nieuwendyk stepped around
Draper, intercepted a pass off the stick of Red Wings defenseman
Uwe Krupp and rushed in to lift the puck over goalie Chris Osgood,
stunning a Joe Louis crowd intent on booing their newest rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 8-3-2 with the victory; the Red Wings fell to
8-7.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``Detroit News'' front-page headline blared yesterday:
``Five reasons to Hate the Stars,'' the Stars gave Red Wings fans
about five more. Five minutes and 39 seconds after Nieuwendyk
scored, Derian Hatcher slapped in a rebound off strong hustling
plays by Nieuwendyk and linemate Pat Verbeek, who invited his old
teacher, Sister Eileen, and accepted her blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she's worried about is whether or not I get hurt,'' said
Verbeek, downplaying an earlier statement the Sister would exorcise
Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   At the 8:13 mark of the first period, Darryl Sydor scored on a
power play set up after Dan Keczmer's hit on Steve Yzerman felled
the Red Wings' captain and started a melee that cost Detroit any
chance at a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Darren McCarty was whistled for mugging Keczmer after the blow,
and the Stars scored 20 seconds into the power play on a Sydor shot
that slipped through the screens of Mike Modano and Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big turning point where we got to them,'' Ludwig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk then assisted on Grant Marshall's goal to make it
4-0, earning his third point of the game _ one goal, two assists.
It was the Stars' biggest offensive output in one period this
season. And it couldn't have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had such slow starts here,'' said Modano, who
responded to coach Ken Hitchcock's challenge to outplay the Red
Wings' Yzerman and Sergei Fedorov. ``Getting out fast was key.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first period, the Stars tried to protect the lead,
forcing goalie Ed Belfour to play one of his best games of the
season _ stopping 34 shots, including several breakaways.
</P>
<P>
   But the message already was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had reassembled his top lines of Modano with Hull and
Jere Lehtinen, and Nieuwendyk with Verbeek and Jamie Langenbrunner,
and the Stars scored four times at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strong in the right areas. We really skated well. We
were really determined,'' Hitchcock said. ``That first period is
really our team, and that's how we'd like to play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   But heading into Boston for the second leg of the weekend road
trip (at 6 tonight), the Stars say they can't afford to have any
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It was a good time to
play these guys, because we were struggling a little bit. But now
it means nothing unless we come away with another good effort.
We're not there yet, we have to keep doing the right things.''

SOX LAND OFFERMAN, WOO BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-BELLE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Gordon Edes  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette closed a deal Friday in Los
Angeles with free agent infielder Jose Offerman but flew home last
night without making an offer to an even bigger prize, free agent
outfielder Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said after arriving at Logan Airport last night that he
and manager Jimy Williams met in Los Angeles Thursday for several
hours with Belle in the office of the slugging left fielder's
agent, Arn Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good opportunity to talk with him,'' Duquette said.
``We answered his questions. He knows Boston. He's played in
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Belle is not scheduled to visit Boston but did not
rule out that possibility. In an interview with the Associated
Press, Belle said from his home in Tucson, Ariz., that he plans to
meet with the Yankees next week.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed with Duquette, saying the GM is ``letting it
all hang out to win. He's not going to be happy until he wins the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a preference between the Red Sox and Yankees,
Belle told AP, ``That's hard to say because I haven't had a chance
to sit down and talk with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Belle said he expects to become the highest-paid
player in baseball, meaning his deal would eclipse the seven-year,
$91 million package catcher Mike Piazza signed with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Mo Vaughn rejected the Red Sox' final proposal to
him, Duquette accelerated contingency plans he made in the event
the All-Star first baseman did not come back. He met with Belle,
then quickly made the deal Friday for Offerman, who said he chose
the Red Sox after considering the Indians and Mariners. Duquette
said Offerman was also pursued by the Orioles and Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Both Duquette and CEO John Harrington have been effusive in
their praise of Belle, whom Duquette called a Hall of Fame-type
hitter. Last night Duquette was just as laudatory, saying Williams
and Belle hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personalitywise, he reminds me of Eddie Murray,'' Duquette
said, referring to the former Orioles first baseman who publicly
was a man of few words but was highly regarded by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has a (workout) routine that is like Nomar's. A very
meticulous routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is also represented by Tellem, who has a number of
prominent NBA clients, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe Bryant came in while we were there,'' said Duquette,
referring to the Lakers star. ``He signed a poster for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he did not know if he was competing against other
teams besides the Yankees. Asked if he thought a deal could be
struck quickly, he said, ``It depends on how the market develops.''
He would not say when he would make an offer to Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, meanwhile, had yet to accept an offer from the Anaheim
Angels and, according to one source, had plans to meet with at
least one other team early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who turned 30 six days ago, agreed to a four-year deal
for a guaranteed $26 million, with a club option for a fifth year.
The native of San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, who
hit .315, led the majors in triples with 13, and stole 45 bases
last season, figures to displace Darren Lewis and Jeff Frye as the
team's leadoff man, though where the Sox plan to play him afield
remains unclear, even to him.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, except for a handful of at-bats at DH, Offerman
played exclusively at second base. He broke into the majors for the
Dodgers as a shortstop, where he led the National League in errors
three times and openly warred with then manager Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Traded to Kansas City for pitcher Billy Brewer after the '95
season, Offerman played both first and second base for the first
time in his big league career before becoming a full-time second
baseman in each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to say,'' Offerman said when asked where he
thinks he'll play for the Sox. ``I haven't talked with (Duquette)
directly. I prefer playing one position, no question. But I'm ready
to play anywhere they want me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox gave a $1 million signing bonus to Offerman, who
last season was paid $2 million by the Royals, including $400,000
in incentives. The new contract calls for Offerman to be paid $4.5
million next year, $5.5 million in 2000, and $6.5 million in each
of the following two seasons. Boston has an $8 million option for
2003, with a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   With Frye, who missed last season because of knee surgery, plus
Donnie Sadler and Lou Merloni, the Red Sox already have a surplus
of second basemen. They have two first base-DH types in Mike
Stanley and Reggie Jefferson, and having hit just seven home runs
last season, Offerman doesn't provide the power production that
teams, especially in the American League, expect from players at
that position.
</P>
<P>
   What Offerman does give the Red Sox is a top-of-the-order
offensive force, one who had an on-base percentage of .403, which
ranked him fifth in the league, just ahead of Vaughn (.402).
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the AL three seasons ago, Offerman has hit
consistently, batting .306 while averaging 82 runs a year for a
team that ranks among the weakest in the league. In that span, he
has hit lefties (.315) and righties (.301) almost equally well,
while batting .303 with runners in scoring position. With the
Royals, he batted in each of the first three spots in the order,
most successfully (.340) in the No. 3 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade that would open up the second base job
full-time, it would appear that Offerman could be used as a Tony
Phillips utility type, logging time at several positions. In their
press release, the Sox mentioned that Offerman could play the
outfield, but he's appeared there only three times in his big
league career.
</P>
<P>
   One Sox player happy with the news of Offerman's signing was
countryman Pedro Martinez, who has known him since both were in the
Dodgers' academy in the Dominican Republic. They played together
for the Dodgers in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' Martinez said. ``He can steal bases and
hit. He can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are pretty close. I really appreciate that Offerman
is coming over to us. He's someone I can go out to eat with, spend
some time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he wasn't surprised Vaughn had elected to reject
the Sox' offer and expressed disappointment that the first baseman
would be going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he also endorsed the idea of Belle joining the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Martinez said. ``He's a great offensive player. He
can help any team. I'm sure he can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle's contract with the White Sox stipulates that he has a
30-day window to explore free agency if he no longer ranks among
the three highest-paid players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who has three years left on a contract paying him $10
million a year, has dropped out of the top three, and when the
White Sox rejected his request to increase his salary by $1.42
million a year, he entered the free agent market.

HUSKIES NEED MORE THAN RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pretty much since Washington football teams played at
Denny Field, there's been a time-honored formula for the Huskies to
beat visitors from California:
</P>
<P>
   -- Dial up weather that would capsize a Neah Bay fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   -- Run the ball down the visitors' throats.
</P>
<P>
   -- Watch those shivering-under-ponchos surfer dudes wonder why
they're bothering with this.
</P>
<P>
   Good game plan, except in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies might be able to arrange that first ingredient when
they meet No. 3 UCLA here Saturday. But they have long since proved
that they can't run the ball, and the Bruins shouldn't lack for
focus unless wind and rain glazes their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington (5-4) is scratching to become bowl eligible in
its 10th game of the season, the Bruins have grown accustomed to
high-stakes poker. They're 8-0 and if they can survive three
dangerous games down the stretch _ UW Saturday, USC next week and
Miami Dec. 5 _ they probably will play for the national title Jan.
4 under the new Bowl Championship Series formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bull's eye on us,'' said UCLA coach Bob Toledo,
and there have been a lot of direct hits preceding narrow escapes
by the Bruins in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Huskies hope to give it their best shot, invoking
history, nostalgia, kismet, tarot cards, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lester Towns, the UW linebacker, ``People have been telling
me stories about how, I guess in 1990, we were No. 2 in the nation
... and they (the Bruins) beat us. That would be a good thing to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so would a running game. The Bruins have been porous
defensively _ ranked ninth in the Pac-10 _ but it's mostly against
the pass. It got so bad Toledo reamed his defensive staff early in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it seems like guys are playing a little tight,
instead of reacting and playing football,'' said UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown. ``Thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(In) the film I've watched,'' said Washington slotback Dane
Looker, ``they have big, strong, fast athletes on `D,' but they're
playing a little softer coverages.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Larry Atkins, UCLA's preseason All-America free safety,
Looker said, ``We've seen some teams run by the safety in the
middle of the field on the seam-route stuff, so if that's open to
us, we've got to take advantage. Obviously, he's a great football
player _ more physical than he is a pass-cover guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other things to consider while wondering why this series hasn't
featured a margin of less than two touchdowns in the past five
meetings:
</P>
<P>
   Bye, bye Brock?
</P>
<P>
   Although he has put the issue on the back burner until season's
end, Husky quarterback Brock Huard likely will play his last home
game Saturday and enter the NFL draft a year early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows that may be a very strong possibility,'' said
Looker.
</P>
<P>
   With 238 yards, Huard would become UW's career passing leader,
surpassing his brother Damon, now a backup with the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He commented on that on the phone the other day,'' Brock Huard
said, smiling. ``I guess he's keeping a little running tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's No. 1 in scoring in our school (Puyallup) history in
basketball, and I was No. 2. He had the highest game ever, with 43,
and I was No. 2, with 42. He's always had one up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   `Play Misty for Me'
</P>
<P>
   For certain, this is a home sendoff for 19 UW seniors, including
seven starters. Their 1994 class was the first of two trimmed to a
maximum 15 scholarships by Pac-10 sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to reset my goals now,'' said offensive lineman Ben
Kadletz. ``All I ever wanted to do was be a Husky. Even when you're
losing games and ticked off at the world, I'd rather have that
feeling than never having come through here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually getting misty-eyed about it the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Less Lester
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, Washington's best defensive player in
1998 was going to be Lester Towns. That was before Towns dropped a
45-pound weightlifting plate on his foot last February, and he
still isn't at full speed after surgery in April.
</P>
<P>
   Towns' game is finding the ball-carrier and hitting him, which
makes the Husky season doubly exasperating. UW opponents haven't
bothered a lot with the run in recent weeks, since the Huskies have
allowed 1,229 yards passing in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's real frustrating,'' said Towns, who, as co-captain,
can't allow himself to get down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to try to keep the young guys confident. You look
at 'em after a big pass, and they come to the sidelines still
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Bruins will test his run-stopping skills. UCLA
rushes for a healthy 185 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of runners ...
</P>
<P>
   Washington fans will get a chance to check out the running back
the Husky coaches would have died for last winter, 6-foot-1,
205-pound Bruin freshman DeShaun Foster. UCLA lists him
third-string, but he plays considerable snaps and averages 5.1
yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took my trip _ I think it was Jan. 2 _ most of the
players weren't there,'' Foster said. ``I didn't get to meet a lot
of them, so I didn't know how I'd fit in. That played a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster says the Huskies finished about fourth in that battle,
behind UCLA, Texas and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place in the Pac-10 would look pretty good to Washington,
currently in a sixth-place tie with California. Almost forgotten is
the fact that UCLA can clinch a tie for the conference title
Saturday, and face a postseason no less rewarding than the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   About the Huskies, Toledo said, ``They're on the edge of playing
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the edge quite like the Bruins.

SIMMONS STEPS IN, FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Anthony Simmons' rookie season has been filled
not with tackles, but trauma. There has been too much pain, and too
few big plays. Rather than wresting expectations, he has wrestled
with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   That will change Sunday, when the Seahawks' first-round draft
choice starts his first NFL game. Simmons will be at right outside
linebacker for the Seahawks' pivotal game against the Raiders in
Oakland because the left hamstring Darrin Smith pulled while
high-stepping into the end zone last week will not allow him to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited. I'm just ready to get in the game,'' Simmons
said Friday after the Seahawks practiced on their bubble-covered
turf field for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawks made Simmons the 15th pick overall in April's
draft, no one anticipated it taking him this long to make an
impact. But his career was sidetracked before it got started. He
sprained his left knee July 31 in the preseason opener and spent
the next six weeks rehabilitating the first serious injury of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a splash of insult to the injury was the emergence of
fourth-round draft choice DeShone Myles. When a calf injury
sidelined Dean Wells for the first two regular-season games, it was
Myles who started at middle linebacker _ the position Simmons was
expected to challenge for when training camp opened. Instead,
Simmons was inactive when his big chance arrived and has since been
moved to outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Anthony wanted to play and I know it's been frustrating
for him being hurt,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, the team's
leading tackler. ``As a rookie and an early pick, you expect to
come in and play. But you get nicked up and suddenly the
fourth-round guy is playing the spot you're supposed to be in and
you're learning a different spot. I'm sure there's been a mental
adjustment in there as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has been frustrated, but he said the worst part was
getting his knee healthy again. He played sparingly, and mostly on
special teams, in Weeks 3-6. But the pain in his knee persisted. He
had arthroscopic surgery Oct. 26 and the knee started feeling
better last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith was injured, Simmons stepped in and recorded five
second-half tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was the first time the knee just felt great,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This week was the first time Simmons had the opportunity to work
with the No. 1 defense in practice. The coaching staff doesn't want
to overload Simmons, so Wells will replace Smith in the nickel
defense used in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also must shuffle their specialty packages because
Mark Collins will be sidelined four to six weeks after breaking his
left shoulder blade in last week's win over the Chiefs. Backup
safety Kerry Joseph will replace Collins in the nickel, with
cornerback Willie Williams moving inside for Collins in the 4-5
defense and being replaced outside by former Raider cornerback
Terry McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   But the burden of replacing the play-making Smith in the base
defense falls to the 6-foot-1, 230-pound Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rookie who missed a lot of camp, so he's still kind of
feeling his way around,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But as he does with everything, Simmons is feeling his way
around at break-neck speed. The rookie is actually faster than
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony is a big-time player,'' cornerback Shawn Springs said.
``He's probably our fastest linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Jim Johnson is even more enamored with what
Simmons does once he completes his run at the ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than the speed, I've been impressed with his
explosiveness,'' Johnson said. ``He has great pop in delivering a
tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pointed to one play last week when Simmons closed ground
in a blink, rolled his hips and knocked Kansas City's 250-pound
tight end Tony Gonzales flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the play, Simmons just grinned. It has taken longer
than expected, but Simmons is finally making the kinds of plays
that allow himself and those who drafted him to smile.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: TE Deems May did not practice and was added to the
injury list as questionable with a sore hamstring, but coach Dennis
Erickson said he expects May to play against the Raiders. ... DT
Dan Saleaumua (sore knee), WR Brian Blades (sore hip) and RB Steve
Broussard (sore hamstring) also sat out practice, but also are
expected to play. ... The Seahawks got a scare during practice when
rookie RB Ahman Green went down after twisting his right knee when
another player stepped on his foot. It was the same knee Green
injured in the Kansas City game, but tests detected no structural
damage. ... Four injured players were named inactive: C Kevin
Glover, FS Eric Stokes, Smith and Collins. ... DL Ralph Hughes, who
was released from the practice squad Wednesday when FS T.J.
Cunningham was added, was re-signed. To clear a spot, Cunningham
was released.

COUGARS, CARDINAL SEARCH FOR LIGHT IN CELLAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Bruised, battered and winless in the Pac-10,
Stanford and Washington State share common ground that neither team
wants to occupy _ last place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our football team is a little banged up and bruised, but still
trying to be very positive and still move forward,'' Stanford coach
Tryone Willingham said.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, WSU coach Mike Price, has a similar
perspective. ``There are a whole bunch of good things that are
going on in the program, but the one bad thing that's going on is
that we're not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team enters Saturday's game at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (injury) list is so long. They're all significant, and
they are all questionable or probable,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal offense has been hurt by injuries to several
receivers, including preseason All-American Troy Walters, and two
prominent fullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars have played most of the season without senior
defensive tackle Gary Holmes. Receiver Nian Taylor, linebacker
Steve Gleason and several other linebackers and linemen also have
missed games due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 41-7 loss to Arizona, receiver Leaford Hackett
and cornerback Dee Moronkola both suffered concussions, and
defensive end Jonathan Nance was hobbled by a sprained Achilles
tendon.
</P>
<P>
   But Price doesn't want his team to use injuries as an excuse. He
liked his team's willingness to bang heads with the Wildcats, even
though the outcome didn't produce a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play as physical and as hard, with as much fight
and intensity, as we did against Arizona,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Gleason, Taylor and Nance are expected to play. Moronkola
traveled with the team, but Price did not know how much Moronkola
would be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   With no chance of postseason bowl appearances by either program,
both coaches were asked if there might be some temptation to look
toward next season by playing a lot of underclassmen in the final
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some regards, you have to look at it as a
springboard,'' Willingham said. ``But at the same time, you have to
balance it out so if you have some good seniors, which we do, that
they have a good taste in their mouth when they depart the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Price doesn't plan any changes and denies that he's starting to
focus on next year. He's more interested in the character of his
current team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has outstanding character and a tremendous attitude
for what has happened to them,'' Price said. ``There's been no
whining, no bitching, no complaining and no pointing fingers. We're
a team, and we stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   PASSING FANCY: Despite its 1-8 record, Stanford has a strong
passing game with strong Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick was WSU's offensive
coordinator under Price from 1989 to '90. Diedrick also was the
University of Washington quarterbacks coach and offensive
coordinator from 1994 to '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up together with similar ideas about the offense, and
he's doing a real good job down there with them,'' Price said.
``I've known Bill Diedrick all my adult life and he's really not
doing anything different than what I would expect him to do. He's
pulling out all the stops, and probably running some plays that he
ran when he was at Rogers High School in Spokane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford passing attack could be the most prolific in school
history, averaging 324 yards, 25 completions and 47 attempts per
game. Stanford QBs need 797 yards passing in the final two games to
break the 1993 record of 3,709 yards.
</P>
<P>
   UNHAPPY CARDINAL: Willingham's record is 20-23 in his four years
as head coach since taking over for Bill Walsh, who stepped down in
late 1995. Willingham is 2-13 in his past 15 games, prompting fans
to callfor a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford athletic director Ted Leland told the San Francisco
Examiner this week he has no intention of asking Willingham to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were at a lot of other schools and we were
one-and-whatever, there would be a lot of pressure,'' Leland said.
``But we're trying to portray the image of stability, and I think
Tryrone portrays that image for us.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NO. 1? Price won't say who he votes for in the weekly USA
Today/ESPN coaches poll, but he's partial to two Pac-10 teams _
Arizona and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not releasing any of my voting, although Arizona might be
the hot team of the Pac-10,'' he said. ``UCLA has seemed to sputter
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Price also has a prediction for his cross-state rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't count the Huskies out in that UCLA-Washington game,
I really wouldn't,'' he said.

RED HOLZMAN, 78, EX-LEADER OF THE KNICKS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Red Holzman, the Hall of Fame coach who led the New
York Knicks to their only two National Basketball Association
championships, died Friday night at Long Island Jewish Hospital. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, whose wife, Selma, died in July, died of complications
from leukemia, according to their daughter, Gail.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from coaching in 1982, Holzman was the
second-winningest coach in NBA history, with a .535 winning
percentage. His 696 victories in regular-season play were second
then only to Red Auerbach's 938, and the number of his triumphs as
a Knick coach _ 613, by far the most in club history _ was retired
on a Knick jersey and raised to the Madison Square Garden rafters
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman was the molder, conductor and architect of one of the
most unusual, most thrilling and, for the involved basketball fan,
most gratifying teams ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 and 1973 championship Knick teams _ the team lost in
the finals in 1972 _ featured, in one or both seasons, Willis Reed
at center; Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Cazzie Russell and Jerry
Lucas at the forwards, and Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe and Dick
Barnett at the guards. The teams brought an excitement to the
Garden that the so-called Mecca of Basketball had rarely seen from
hometown professional play.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers of Wilt Chamberlain,
Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in a grueling seven-game series for
their first title, and Holzman was named coach of the year. They
beat the Lakers again in 1973, this time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman was voted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield,
Mass., in 1991, on the strength of his ability to successfully
instill the basic precepts of the game into his team, and that was
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is such a thing as a coaching genius,''
Holzman said, ``just hard workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman's hard work revolved around the fundamentals of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed defense _ pressure defense,'' he once said. ``And
team basketball. And, on offense, moving the ball to hit the open
man.'' In huddles he would sometimes let his players devise plays
to create baskets. As for defense, however, he was the sole voice.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, a City College of New York all-American, a pioneer
player in the NBA with the Rochester Royals and a former coach with
the Milwaukee and St. Louis Hawks, had been a scout for the Knicks
when, in December 1967, the team owner, Ned Irish, decided to
replace the coach, Dick McGuire. The team was in last place, and
Irish decided to reach out to the nearest candidate, which he
presumed to be Holzman.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman was not interested. ``I like scouting,'' he said. But
Irish persisted. ``And I realized that if I didn't take the
coaching job,'' Holzman said, ``I might not have any job.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman began his Knick reign by fining several players for
coming late to his first practice. The fines were for $10 each, but
they set a tone.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Holzman could be quite tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Red's early years, he was by design a
superauthoritarian,'' Bradley said, ``and I was one of his targets
for abuse. I would go for days without speaking to him. But his
manner changed after we won the championship in 1970, and he became
downright paternal and kind. Playing basketball became more fun
than I had ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the sideline, the tail of Holzman's suit jacket flapping
in the imaginary wind, he could be vociferous, particularly to
referees. But he always seemed to keep his poise and sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Holzman seemed an uncomplicated man, but he had
many layers. He liked to tell reporters that he was boring, and
that they should look elsewhere for the good stories. One writer
wrote a column in which he imagined Holzman disappearing in his
office in a cloud of humility. But indeed he understood his value,
and had a wide range of interests: he read history books and
detective novels, and he was a lover of films, particularly the old
ones, and of good food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife bought a house in Cedarhurst, N.Y., in the
affluent Five Towns area of Long Island in the 1950s, and stayed
there all their lives, raising Gail, their only child. But the
house was as understated as Red Holzman's life seemed _ away from
the basketball court, that is.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the television in their den was not color.
``What's wrong with black and white?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had nine suits, he said, all the same color. ``Who's
looking?'' he wanted to know. He ordered his clothes by mail.
``They know my size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was a street philosopher of sorts, with such homemade
axioms as ``Never let a bald barber cut your hair, he has no
respect for it.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks made the playoffs in the season in which
Holzman took over the club, he agreed to stay on as coach. In
December of the next season, the team traded for DeBusschere,
giving the Knicks a tremendous force around the basket, as a
defensive forward and long-range shooter. It was the piece that
made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Holzman helped to engineer a trade that brought Monroe to
the Knicks. Many thought the Knicks would need two basketballs,
with Frazier and Monroe both needing to handle the ball in the
backcourt. But under Holzman's guidance and team orientation, the
players fit in perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   William Holzman was born on Aug. 10, 1920, on the Lower East
Side of Manhattan and moved with his family to a tenement in the
Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn when he was 4. His
parents were Jewish immigrants, his mother from Romania, his father
from Russia. His mother, Sophie, was, he said, ``a terrific cook
and made every meal taste as if you were eating it for the first
time in your life.'' His father, Abraham, was a tailor, and, like
many Jewish parents, discouraged his son from playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   But young ``Roita,'' as he called him, which was Yiddish for Red
_ Yiddish was the language Holzman grew up with _ became a standout
athlete at Franklin K. Lane High School (which in 1977 named its
new sports facility the William Red Holzman Gymnasium).
</P>
<P>
   Red was the tallest person in his family, at 5 feet 10 inches.
He received a basketball scholarship to the University of
Baltimore. ``But I missed the soul food that my mother made, and I
was always hungry,'' he recalled. ``I missed my folks. I missed
Selma. And after six months I transferred to City College of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   He became an all-America guard for two seasons there for the
legendary taskmaster-coach Nat Holman, whose basketball
philosophies of aggressive defense, movement without the ball, and
hitting the open man Red would bring to perfection in his time as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he enlisted in the Navy and was placed in the morale
unit at the Norfolk Naval Base. His job was to play basketball
against other service and college teams, and he became friendly
with a baseball player on the base, Phil Rizzuto. On one weekend
pass, he returned to Brooklyn and married Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman went on to play nine seasons for the Royals, playing
alongside such stars as Bobby Davies and Bobby Wanzer. He was an
integral part of the NBA championship team that beat the Knicks in
a seven-game finals series in 1951 _ and was dribbling the ball,
killing the clock, protecting the 4-point lead at game's end.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly for the Milwaukee Hawks _ he finished his
career with a 7.4-point scoring average and then took over as coach
when the franchise moved to St. Louis in 1955 _ until midway
through the 1956-57 season when, despite having taken the team to
the playoffs the season before, he was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Holzman was hired as chief scout for the Knicks, a move
engineered by his pal Fuzzy Levane, then the coach of the Knicks.
In an age before mass communications allowed for few secrets of
prospects, Holzman beat the bushes, traveling all over the country
in search of possible players. His recommendations included players
like Reed and Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman became general manager and coach of the Knicks and
repaid a favor by hiring Levane as scout. But when the great Knick
teams began to dissolve because of age and injuries, Holzman was
fired in 1977 after the team missed the playoffs for the second
straight year, and was replaced by Reed. Two years later he was
brought back as coach and remained until after the 1981-82 season.
With a new set of players, Holzman, then 62 and the oldest coach in
the league, was unable to duplicate his earlier triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   He remained a consultant to the Knicks, and a valued elder
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughter and one grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Through the good days and bad, Holzman retained his
sophisticated yet homespun composure. In winter he played mixed
tennis doubles (``the women usually beat me, but I give them a
workout'') and in summer he regularly went to an oceanside club
near his home. ``I like to go to the beach,'' he said, lighting up
a cigar. ``It's a good life.''

time in your life.'' His father, Abraham, was a tailor, and, like
many Jewish parents, discouraged his son from playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   But young ``Roita,'' as he called him, which was Yiddish for Red
_ Yiddish was the language Holzman grew up with _ became a standout
athlete at Franklin K. Lane High School (which in 1977 named its
new sports facility the William Red Holzman Gymnasium).
</P>
<P>
   Red was the tallest person in his family, at 5 feet 10 inches.
He received a basketball scholarship to the University of
Baltimore. ``But I missed the soul food that my mother made, and I
was always hungry,'' he recalled. ``I missed my folks. I missed
Selma. And after six months I transferred to City College of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   He became an all-America guard for two seasons there for the
legendary taskmaster-coach Nat Holman, whose basketball
philosophies of aggressive defense, movement without the ball, and
hitting the open man Red would bring to perfection in his time as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he enlisted in the Navy and was placed in the morale
unit at the Norfolk Naval Base. His job was to play basketball
against other service and college teams, and he became friendly
with a baseball player on the base, Phil Rizzuto. On one weekend
pass, he returned to Brooklyn and married Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman went on to play nine seasons for the Royals, playing
alongside such stars as Bobby Davies and Bobby Wanzer. He was an
integral part of the NBA championship team that beat the Knicks in
a seven-game finals series in 1951 _ and was dribbling the ball,
killing the clock, protecting the 4-point lead at game's end.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly for the Milwaukee Hawks _ he finished his
career with a 7.4-point scoring average and then took over as coach
when the franchise moved to St. Louis in 1955 _ until midway
through the 1956-57 season when, despite having taken the team to
the playoffs the season before, he was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Holzman was hired as chief scout for the Knicks, a move
engineered by his pal Fuzzy Levane, then the coach of the Knicks.
In an age before mass communications allowed for few secrets of
prospects, Holzman beat the bushes, traveling all over the country
in search of possible players. His recommendations included players
like Reed and Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman became general manager and coach of the Knicks and
repaid a favor by hiring Levane as scout. But when the great Knick
teams began to dissolve because of age and injuries, Holzman was
fired in 1977 after the team missed the playoffs for the second
straight year, and was replaced by Reed. Two years later he was
brought back as coach and remained until after the 1981-82 season.
With a new set of players, Holzman, then 62 and the oldest coach in
the league, was unable to duplicate his earlier triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   He remained a consultant to the Knicks, and a valued elder
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughter and one grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Through the good days and bad, Holzman retained his
sophisticated yet homespun composure. In winter he played mixed
tennis doubles (``the women usually beat me, but I give them a
workout'') and in summer he regularly went to an oceanside club
near his home. ``I like to go to the beach,'' he said, lighting up
a cigar. ``It's a good life.''

</P>
<P>

Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ISAIAH-BERLIN-REASSESS _ The British philosopher Isaiah Berlin

COMMENTARY: A CHILD'S `CONFESSION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lacresha Murray is a 14-year-old prisoner at the Giddings State
Home and School in Giddings, Texas, about 60 miles east of Austin,
the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   She is serving a term of 25 years after being found guilty in
1996 of criminally negligent homicide and injury to a child in the
death of a 2{-year-old girl named Jayla Belton.
</P>
<P>
   The case was a local sensation. Excited prosecutors and other
law-enforcement officials stumbled over one another in their rush
to portray Lacresha, just 11 years old, as a juvenile monster, a
homicidal maniac who attacked Jayla and inflicted a savage beating,
eventually breaking four of her ribs and rupturing her liver.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner said the injuries were like those that
might result if a person went through the windshield in a
high-speed car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors referred to Lacresha in private as ``La Creature.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha was convicted twice (the first verdict was overturned),
but a close look at the case shows that she was the victim of a
colossal miscarriage of justice. She remains trapped in a
Texas-sized nightmare, a naive child with learning difficulties who
was tricked into signing a confession she could barely read and
surely didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors ignored evidence that Jayla had long been the victim
of child abuse. There was no legitimate evidence against Lacresha.
None. No witnesses, no forensic evidence _ not so much as a drop of
blood or a speck of body fluid of any kind. Twenty or more police
officers scoured the premises where she supposedly killed the
child. They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Jayla had been dropped off on the morning of May 24, 1996, at a
small, one-family house in Austin where Lacresha lived with three
siblings and their grandparents, R.L. and Shirley Murray. Ms.
Murray provided day care for Jayla and a number of other children.
But Jayla's mother, Judy Belton, and her boyfriend, Derrick Shaw,
had been told not to bring the child on May 24 because Ms. Murray
would be away. Shaw dropped the baby off anyway.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Murrays and a number of people who visited the
house that day, Jayla was clearly ill. She was listless, refused to
eat, perspired profusely and was vomiting. In the early evening,
the Murrays said, Lacresha noticed that the baby was ``shaking real
bad.'' In fact, the child had gone into convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Murray and Lacresha rushed the child to a hospital, but
frantic efforts to save her failed.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Austin police. The medical examiner is reported to
have told investigators that no one could survive more than 15
minutes with a ruptured liver. The investigators, still without a
suspect, took that to mean there was a good chance that the last
person seen with the child was the killer. Lacresha had carried
Jayla into the hospital. The cops zeroed in on her.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha was kept away from her family for four days and finally
was subjected to a lengthy police interrogation, without the
benefit of a lawyer. An officer ran through what was surely to her
an incomprehensible reading of her rights, after which he said:
``You've heard them before, on TV shows probably, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha insisted she had done nothing harmful to Jayla. ``Why
would I want to hurt a child?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The cops told her that a doctor, ``with over 20 years of
experience,'' had said the baby died at precisely the time that
Lacresha said she noticed the baby was shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do nothing,'' Lacresha replied. ``I promise to God.''
</P>
<P>
   The interrogation was a travesty. Unable to shake her
protestations of innocence, the police finally resorted to asking
if it were at least ``possible'' that Lacresha had dropped the
baby, or even kicked her.
</P>
<P>
   She was told, ``We're going to stay here until you tell us the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Isolated and without a lawyer's help, Lacresha eventually said
that the suggestions made by the interrogators were possible, even
``probable.'' She developed a fantastic scenario that could in no
way account for the injuries Jayla suffered. But it was enough for
the police.
</P>
<P>
   A confession was typed up. Lacresha was asked, ``Can you read
pretty good?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, ``but I try hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As she read over her ``confession,'' Lacresha asked the
officers, ``What's that word? Home-a-seed?''
</P>
<P>
   When she was told that the word was ``homicide,'' she asked,
``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   No one answered.

COMMENTARY: THE PINK POODLE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York is a tough town.
</P>
<P>
   The planet's most famous intern was cruelly reminded of that as
she stormed around tony Manhattan stores and restaurants last week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News, which featured a photo of Ms. Lewinsky
looking like an upscale bag lady and a detailed map of her shopping
and eating tour, chronicled her tantrums with restaurant workers,
other diners and photographers, and her zesty feasts on leg of lamb
and polenta with chocolate sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Poor girl. No wonder she's in a bad humor. Her commercial window
of opportunity is slamming shut. The nation, once glued to the soap
opera of Monica and Bill, has canceled the show. Paula Jones has
settled. The Republicans have been afflicted with a sudden case of
realism. And the other ``high heel,'' as commentators dubbed former
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, apparently won't be
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Monica must be in a panic to squeeze the last drop of profit
from this sordid tale. After Ken Starr wrote up her story so
voluminously and with such bodice-ripping fervor, Monica and her
mother realized with alarm that they had been scooped. Surely
Marcia Lewis, the author of ``The Private Lives of the Three
Tenors,'' knows you can't write a tell-all after all has been told.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was one of the big losers in the election. She lost
her chance to be Oliver North and rivet the country at a
congressional hearing. So now all she has to sell is her voice. It
is all that hasn't been heard. It is a voice that men say they find
alluring, not the ditsy Valley Girl voice the world is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Monica wants to unburden herself to Barbara Walters, to cloak
herself in the legitimacy of the interviewer to stars and kings.
But then she would have to sell an interview overseas to make
money. There are lawyers to be paid, not to mention Bloomingdale's,
Ann Taylor, Bergdorf's and personal trainers.
</P>
<P>
   She has also been mulling an offer from Fox, a
multimillion-dollar package deal that would include a book, an
interview and a made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that Monica's best bet to upgrade her image _
from president-chasing vixen to victim caught between a warring
prosecutor and president _ is clearly the made-for-TV movie about
the made-for-TV scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A good title for the movie might be the line that Lucianne
Goldberg used last week to describe the taped conversations between
Monica and Linda Tripp: ``A lot of pain, a lot of anguish and a lot
of shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Why settle for Shannen Doherty or Tiffani-Amber Thiessen when
Monica could play Monica? (This idea apparently came up in passing
with the Fox folks.) Monica, after all, did win a sixth-grade
talent contest for her dancing and singing. She had a speaking part
in ``The Music Man'' in high school and was voted ``Most Likely to
Have Her Name in Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Her baby diva behavior in New York, and the new Vanity Fair
featuring outtakes from her Herb Ritts epiphany in Malibu, confirm
that a star is aching to be born. Now comes Ms. Lewinsky in
powder-blue chiffon cuddling a poodle that has been dyed pink
wearing a rhinestone collar. (The poodle, not Ms. Lewinsky.)
</P>
<P>
   Who else can bring the right nuance to the line readings of
``Blah, blah, blah,'' ``Da, da, da,'' much less, ``I never expected
to fall in love with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   And who better to play the stage mother than the stage mother
herself?
</P>
<P>
   They should use, as a template, the unforgettable made-for-TV
movie, ``Tears and Laughter: the Joan and Melissa Rivers Story,''
which starred Joan and her daughter somewhat convincingly playing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Marcia starring as themselves would not only be
ratings catnip. It would be cathartic for the mantrapping
mother-daughter team.
</P>
<P>
   Only Ms. Lewis could do justice to the scene where she emerges
from her pummeling by Starr prosecutors, with a wheelchair at the
ready, ashen-faced, showing her best side.
</P>
<P>
   Who but the real mother could bring the controlled fury
necessary to pull off the crucial party scene where she confronts
Evelyn Lieberman, the White House deputy chief of staff charged
with keeping nubile babes out of Bill Clinton's sight line, and
demands that her daughter be transferred back from her Pentagon
Siberia to the president-trapping zone of the White House _ her
rightful territory?
</P>
<P>
   When politics becomes entertainment, who needs actors?
</P>

JUST ANOTHER COACH  
 HALL OF FAMER ABDUL-JABBAR STARTS SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITERIVER _ It is the first day of basketball practice at
Alchesay High School, and point guard Kyle Goklish, walking down
the hallway, isn't sure what to make of the giant figure ahead.
</P>
<P>
   From a short distance, all the 5-foot-8 senior can see is the
body through the office door in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Who the heck is that?' '' Goklish said. ``One of
my friends got scared. All you could see was this person and no
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked down there and he ducked his head out the door. I go,
`Oh, that's Kareem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's right.
</P>
<P>
   It is Goklish's and the rest of the Falcons' new assistant
coach, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The 7-foot-2 basketball Hall of Famer
is the tallest man anybody at Alchesay has ever seen on the White
Mountain Apache Indian Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him . . . '' Goklish said, his eyes
slowly turning up toward the Alchesay Activity Center rafters, ``it
made me look like an ant.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting first day for the Alchesay basketball
players, most of whom stand about 5-10 and were too young to
remember how Abdul-Jabbar dominated the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed up in the morning,'' Goklish said. ``The next thing
you know, they were like bees flying to honey. All these reporters
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists flock to the reservation to see the surreal _ the
former Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers great, the NBA's
all-time leading scorer, a man who owns Kareem Productions and a
mansion in Beverly Hills _ work his first coaching job on a remote
reservation in northeastern Arizona. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Coach Raul Mendoza and Abdul-Jabbar greeted 80
players for varsity and junior varsity tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting center Ivan Lamkin, at 6-6 the tallest person at
Alchesay before Abdul-Jabbar arrived, said the awe ended quickly
when Abdul-Jabbar put him and the rest of the players at ease.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamkin can't help but take home stories about being tutored
on the drop-step move by one of the greatest centers to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the hook shot,'' Lamkin said.
</P>
<P>
   This day, after more interviews and a portrait shot with six of
his players for`` ESPN Magazine,'' Abdul-Jabbar, a coach's whistle
hanging from his neck, led the Falcons on the court in stretching
exercises and drills after Mendoza addressed them on the importance
of grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have to stay out of each other's way,'' Abdul-Jabbar
yelled after seeing enough of a sloppy three-on-two drill.
``Communicate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he stopped the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, you guys should be making 100 percent of your layups,''
he said. ``You've got to make layups to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, Abdul-Jabbar instructed, ``Get back on defense.
Be sure to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour into practice, a crowd formed in the doorway of
the Activity Center. There were community members, parents,
toddlers, even a few former college athletes who drove nearly four
hours from the Valley to see Abdul-Jabbar at work.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil-Allah Muhammad, who once tried out for the Golden State
Warriors, said he got to know Abdul-Jabbar 25 years ago. Muhammad,
who lives in Phoenix, is surprised but pleased to find him on a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is excellent,'' Muhammad said. ``Kareem has a
spirit that is infectious. He is non-judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who led the Falcons to the Class 3A final last year,
doesn't mind moving into the background while Abdul-Jabbar takes
over the instructions on fundamentals. Mendoza believes it will be
a comfortable fit on the bench and on the long bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's soft-spoken,'' Mendoza said. ``I think I raise my voice
more than he does, and I'm pretty quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I had Bobby Knight here, I'd be more nervous. I can
relate to Kareem's personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice wrapped up. All that was left were the gassers. As the
players lined up, Abdul-Jabbar tied his shoes and took off his
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ready, coach?'' assistant coach Rusty Taylor asked.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier practice, Abdul-Jabbar lasted 40 seconds and
said, ``It was a near-death experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Abdul-Jabbar smiled at Taylor and said, ``Don't tempt
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar lined up with the players. Mendoza blew his
whistle, and Abdul-Jabbar, 51, took off down the court. Some
players lapped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurry up, Kareem,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar completed the required minute. Afterward, Taylor
said, ``You looked better than you did Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to look good, doing that at my age,'' Abdul-Jabbar
said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Sports Illustrated'' photographer, wrapping up a day of
shooting, asked Abdul-Jabbar where he would be the next day.
Mendoza joked with Abdul-Jabbar to remember to bring his whistle or
he'll be fined.
</P>
<P>
   Then Abdul-Jabbar retreated to his Pinetop condo, about a
half-hour drive from the reservation, and jotted notes in a journal
he's keeping for a book he plans to write on his season.
</P>
<P>
   It has hardly been quiet, so far, for Abdul-Jabbar. But serenity
is not all that he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for the team, for the kids,'' he said. ``The people
here have been very friendly, very nice, very accepting. I've been
touched by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most in this community didn't believe Abdul-Jabbar would follow
through on his decision to coach here.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Abdul-Jabbar is here, the ``White Mountain
Independent'' has been running ads on purchasing tickets, because
they'll be scarce during the season. Every home game is expected to
sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is like, `Hey, look who I saw?' '' said Barry Wilson,
a shift manager at the Indian Pine Restaurant inside the Hon-Dah
Casino and Resort. ``It's definitely the big buzz in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   The season will start in Tucson on Nov. 24, when the Falcons
will play in a four-day tournament hosted by Class 1A St. Gregory.
Mendoza fears that the gyms at the tournament will be too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of people there to see Kareem,'' Mendoza
said. ``I think that in turn is just going to make these kids work
that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar figured he'd be able to live a quiet, peaceful life
in a remote part of Arizona. Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar, not known for having great rapport with the media
during his playing days, was accessible and easygoing. Waves of
reporters rolled through daily. He answered questions, sometimes
interjecting humor, before and after practices.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he half expected to see a prima donna walk through
the gym the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He allows you to make comments; he allows you to coach,''
Taylor said. ``A ``Sports Illustrated'' guy interviewed me and
said, `Aren't you intimidated by Jabbar?' I said, `If I was playing
him one-on-one, yeah. But coaching-wise, no. I know my stuff and he
knows his stuff, and we share our information.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has something in common with Abdul-Jabbar _ an interest
in history. They discuss it all the time. Taylor, a history
teacher, is also the school's chess coach, and his team qualified
for state for the first time. He's challenged Abdul-Jabbar to a
game of chess.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You want to play me a little one-on-one afterwards?'
'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' spent three days here. A former Show Low
athlete was filming a documentary on Abdul-Jabbar's season on the
reservation. ``Good Morning America, ''``People,'' ESPN, the`` New
York'' ``Daily News,''``'' the`` Washington Post,'' so far, have
swept through, wondering why Abdul-Jabbar would get his first taste
of the coaching profession at Alchesay, a five-month gig that will
pay him all of $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've developed relationships here, and I've made friends,'' he
said. ``It's kind of more than friends. It's become family.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Abdul-Jabbar came here in the role of historian
and author to trace the Buffalo Soldiers, who were stationed in the
area more than 100 years ago. He spent two days researching the
origins of the soldiers for a chapter on Blacks in the military for
his book, ``Black Profiles in Courage''.
</P>
<P>
   During that visit, Abdul-Jabbar was befriended by Edgar Perry,
who operated the White Mountain Apache Cultural Center. Perry took
Abdul-Jabbar to all the historic spots in the area. He supplied
Abdul-Jabbar with historical background. Perry didn't see a
brooding and remote basketball legend, but a man with a big heart
who became animated when talking about history, how his roots had
crossed paths with the Apache culture after the Civil War, how
Black calvarymen earned 18 of 370 Congressional Medals of Honor
during the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The two men became close and remained in touch while
Abdul-Jabbar put together the chapter on the Buffalo Soldiers, who
supplemented their rations by hunting buffalo and were given the
nickname by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after the school completed construction of the Activity
Center, a $9 million, 3,500-seat jewel that tribal funds helped pay
for, it was Perry who convinced school officials to get
Abdul-Jabbar to speak during a ribbon-cutting ceremony in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dressed up like a cow boy with this big ol' hat,'' said
Holyan Endfield, a junior trying out for the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   A cowboy at heart, Abdul-Jabbar said he became interested in
coaching two years ago. He has worked individually with center
Shawn Bradley, among others, and coached a team of college
all-stars at the Nike Desert Classic in Phoenix last spring. He
wants to coach in the NBA and lobbied for jobs with the Los Angeles
Clippers and at Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work out, so he became content with taking small
steps.
</P>
<P>
   It can't get much smaller than Alchesay.
</P>
<P>
   Perry visited Abdul-Jabbar at his home in Beverly Hills last
June and brought a group from the reservation who performed a
tribal dance for him. Perry gave Abdul-Jabbar a drum and a feather.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried calling me three times after that,'' Perry said. ``I
called him and he said, `Edgar, I want to coach at Alchesay High
School.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Principal Herve Dardis and Superintendent
John Clark in July, Abdul-Jabbar was granted his wish, knowing that
he would have to share the job with Mendoza. It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar said he is here for only a buck because he was
moved by a message he heard more than a year ago from Gen. Colin
Powell on the impact celebrities could have on youths by
volunteering their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lot of sense to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar said he has no financial worry. He has time and is
captivated with the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked what I had to say and what I could offer,'' said
Abdul-Jabbar, who also agreed to lecture classes on what he learned
about the Buffalo Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamkin said he also hopes Abdul-Jabbar talks to his English
class about the NBA lockout for a paper he's writing.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar said he doesn't especially like the NBA game today.
During practice, he tries to teach the things he learned at UCLA
from John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a two-man game,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar sat in a small classroom at Cradle Board Elementary
School just outside of Whiteriver, where Perry teaches the Apache
language to kindergarteners through fifth graders. This day,
Perry's only student was a 7-2 bald Black man. Abdul-Jabbar
stammered and struggled through the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many guttural sounds,'' he said. ``It's a very
hard language to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can have a pretty good conversation in Apache with (Perry's)
5-year-old granddaughter. We're at about the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know if this will be his only season here.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar said he is taken with the spirit of the people and
the beauty of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy who watched too many Westerns, when I finally came
here and walked the land, it was pretty special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a universe away from his childhood in Harlem, but, in a
sense, not so far removed from his roots.
</P>
<P>
   The rundown homes, the depressed economy, a feeling of
hopelessness that are part of reservation living are all reminders
of the world he's left.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also been moved by the deep roots of a community that
has made basketball a religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the neighborhood I was from, it wasn't that much different
from the reservation or any barrio or ghetto with poverty and lack
of economic opportunity and not a good educational opportunity,''
Abdul-Jabbar said. ``They all have a very negative effect on
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Abdul-Jabbar's missions here, he said, is to get the
players to think about college and not just basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a very disadvantaged place,'' he said. ``Harlem is
about as disadvantaged as you can get. Yet, I was able to be a
successful athlete and I was able to get a college degree coming
from those circumstances. So I am walking proof that it can be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said it didn't take Abdul-Jabbar's presence to turn up
basketball fever on the reservation. The Activity Center is usually
standing-room only.
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes on the little team, Goklish said he feels an even
greater pressure than usual to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, this team is expected to win the state
championship,'' he said. ``Last year, we came three points away
from winning the state title. Maybe Kareem will give us that extra
boost to get us the championship.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS POLISHES CLASS ACT  
 CARDINALS CORNERBACK IS CONSUMMATE PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's third and 13 on the Washington Redskins' opening drive.
Trent Green, from shotgun formation, lobs a screen pass to running
back Brian Mitchell, who is headed for daylight. The Redskins are
about to convert.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the play, Aeneas Williams, who converted long ago,
comes flying across the field to stop Mitchell 2 yards short of the
first down.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of play that Williams routinely makes that goes
unnoticed, the kind consistent with future Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows Williams can cover a speedy wide-out. There is a
lengthy trail of carnage and four straight Pro Bowl starts as his
supporting evidence. But he also does the other things _ playing
the run, making the backside pursuits, and now even blitzing _ the
elements of a complete game that the very best cornerbacks who are
enshrined in Canton, Ohio, have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like if there's one area Aeneas really has improved on
the last two or three years it is playing the run,'' said Larry
Marmie, Cardinals defensive backfield coach. ``This last game he
had seven tackles. Some of those things go unnoticed unless it's on
a pass play. Take that third-down play when the Redskins threw that
screen away from him. He was on the other side of the field and
stopped them from getting the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Aeneas takes pride in his run support because he knows
he's probably thought of as a cover corner. He has taken pride in
being a physical player, not only in his tackles but in his jamming
of receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has only one interception in nine games, unusually low
for someone who has led, or shared, the lead among NFL cornerbacks
three times in his first seven seasons. Foes throw away from him,
for one thing. The Cardinals in general haven't been hurt deep
because of a furious pass rush, for another. So this might be
Williams' best overall season, his most complete season. It could
even be a step in a journey that takes him to the Pro Football Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a man dedicated to his profession and his personal
Christian beliefs, isn't the sort who allows himself to sit around
imagining such things for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long-term goal,'' Williams said. ``I think it's
something you think about in terms of the big picture. Certainly
the details of today will determine the ultimate outcome, whether
that goal comes to fruition. But each day it's very important to
find out what's important now.''
</P>
<P>
   So each day, Williams is among the first to arrive at the
Cardinals training facility to watch film, on his own, of the
receivers and quarterback he will face on Sunday. It has paid off.
He has returned six of his 39 picks for touchdowns, breaking the
team record that was held by a man who is in the Hall of Fame,
Larry Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also is among the last to leave the practice field,
often working after practice, and always staying as one of the
leaders of the players' prayer circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of a professional,'' said Marmie, ``regardless of
what his business might be he treats his job with great conviction.
Aeneas is not only good on the field but in the classroom, in
preparation, in studying. This is a guy who still takes notes every
day when we're looking at the practice film. To me, Aeneas
epitomizes what a professional football player is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think the other thing that comes through after you're
around him for a while is you see that this quality doesn't just
pertain to his football life. It pertains to his personal life, his
family, his Christian beliefs. I know we hear people say things
about that, but some people truly do live their life the way that
it appears. When I think about Aeneas. I think about a true
professional, and he would be that regardless of the profession he
is in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that there were 58 better players in the
1991 draft before Williams was selected in the third round. From
the point of view of Terry Bradshaw, a Hall of Fame quarterback who
now is a FOX-TV analyst, Williams is among the best. That might be
irrelevant when voters consider him for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning gets votes,'' Bradshaw said. ``The only reason I'm in
the Hall of Fame is because we won four Super Bowls. Look at my
stats and they don't measure up to Hall of Fame. I think you would
have to consider Aeneas, but the problem would be winning. That's
one unfortunate thing about the process.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams, 30, does get dings that force him to miss plays,
he doesn't miss games. Sunday, when his classic rivalry is renewed
with Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, Williams is scheduled
to make his 119th consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of Williams' work against Irvin in the season
opener, a 38-10 loss to the Cowboys at Texas Stadium, Williams
wouldn't get a Hall of Fame vote. Irvin caught nine passes for 119
yards.
</P>
<P>
   But on the basis of Williams' work against Irvin, a fellow Pro
Bowler, in the Cowboys' last visit to Sun Devil Stadium, a 25-22
Cardinals overtime win last season, Williams would make it easily
on the first ballot. He limited Irvin to four receptions for 18
yards, Irvin's lowest average per catch in six years. Further,
Williams shut out Irvin during the critical closing 35 minutes _
the final 12 in the third quarter, 15 in the fourth, and 8 in
overtime _ not a catch when the game was being decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Aeneas is one of the best cornerbacks in the game
today,'' said Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey. ``He's a great competitor
and from what I know about him a great person. The match-up with
Michael Irvin is one of those that those of us who get to watch it
through the years will talk about for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' coverage skills place him among an elite few who are
even asked to play Irvin man-to-man. The Cowboys receiver is more
accustomed to seeing zone defenses. Marmie and Cardinals defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said they have some new wrinkles ready in
how they will deploy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the coaches do with him, Williams always spends
most of his time covering the opponent's best receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame, to me, is a very, very special thing,'' said
McGinnis, who this year had a former linebacker, Mike Singletary,
inducted. ``I would say, yes, Aeneas is moving toward that, but to
me that's a very, very special honor that comes after a career and
a lifetime of achievement. It's a hard tag to put on anybody while
they're still going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest compliment I could pay him is to say that Aeneas
is like having Singletary play corner in your defense. He is an
extraordinary professional. I think that gives him a chance.'' &QL;

KENYAN ON QUITE A RUN  
 BUNGEI SEEKS ANOTHER 10K VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ In autumn, James Bungei falls back to Kenyan time.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather turns brisk along the Sandia Mountains, Bungei
can train at any hour, just as he could in his native Rift Valley
in the highland of western Kenya. He doesn't need to be on the
clock to fit in his workout around the heat _ the heat that each
year saps his road racing success.
</P>
<P>
   The fall is for cross country, a peak in Bungei's seasonal cycle
since he came to the United States in 1990 and won the first of
four consecutive NAIA titles at Lubbock Christian University. A
streak that no one else, at any collegiate level, has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were races in November, December, January and
February, I would be doing them,'' Bungei said.
</P>
<P>
   The best races in Phoenix are during those months, which partly
explains why for three years Bungei has swept in from altitude to
win five consecutive major 10K titles, a string unmatched in
Arizona running history. ``Mr. November'' goes for No. 6 Sunday at
the 23rd ``New Times'' Phoenix 10K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go there like any other race, but for some reason when
I'm there . . .,'' said Bungei, his smile completing the thought.
``Phoenix is not a high elevation like here (Albuquerque), and I
like running on flat courses. And in the morning, it's not that
hot. The people are very nice. They really appreciate what the
runners do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Everytown USA is glad when the Kenyans hit their
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' recently included Kenyan distance runners
in its list of ``What's Right About Sports'': ``They come swift and
silent _ one, two, then a pack _ faces glistening, feet barely
touching the ground, gliding toward a distant forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many Americans, the Kenyans are like a faceless
basketball Dream Team, sweeping up all the cash in their path but
not registering as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York City Marathon on Nov. 1, Kenyans placed 1-2 and
7-10, winning a combined $165,000. Same thing, different Kenyans
three weeks earlier at the LaSalle Banks Chicago Marathon: 1, 4-5,
7, 10 earning a combined $190,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix 10K pays a paltry $5,200 combined, not including
time bonuses, to elite men and women, almost all of which will come
back in the hands of one Kenyan or another with 10 percent going to
their agent, Shawn Hellebuyck.
</P>
<P>
   Hellebuyck is based with her runners in Albuquerque at 5,300
feet, lower than their 7,000-foot home near Lake Victoria in
altitude training nonetheless. She contends that many U.S. race
directors ``want the one Kenyan who will win the race, they don't
care who, and not the second and third Kenyans. People want an
integrated field.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe South African Zithulele Sinque or Australian Andrew
Leatherbee will break up a Kenyan men's sweep in Phoenix, but guess
what? Hellebuyck represents them, too, as she tries to diversify
her clientele. ``I want to get a couple of good Americans,'' she
said, knowing they remain few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The six-bedroom, four-bath Hellebuyck home northeast of downtown
Albuquerque is like an Olympic Village, athletes living there or
nearby and filtering through at all hours in a perpetual
train-eat-sleep cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Hellebuyck, an American whose Belgian husband, Eddy, is within
six sub 2-hour, 20-minute marathons of tying the world record of
28, represents 20 runners, half of those Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   There is Bungei (pronounced Boon-gay), ranked eighth in 1998
world road rankings by ``Runner's World,'' and Jane Omoro, rated
third. Both hold records for the 22-year-old Phoenix 10K (28:11 and
32:35). And there is Mbarak Hussein, Bungei's college teammate and
still training partner, Jimmy Muindi, Thomas Osano and his wife
Delillah Asiago, all in Sunday's field.
</P>
<P>
   Bungei and Hussein, whose older brother Ibrahim was the 1987 New
York City Marathon champion, arrive at Hellebuyck's home on Kenyan
time, several hours after an appointment. A trio of Czechoslovakia
triathletes who dropped in the night before are out running with
Eddy Hellebuyck.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Shvetsov, a Russian who was 11th in New York, is back
from his workout and spouting opinions on everything from runner
identification chips to blood doping. Much to the restrained
amusement of the Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   Bungei, 30, speaks English with enough of an accent to demand
rapt attention, making it difficult for reporters on race days when
time to flesh out a story is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around him long enough that I can translate for
him,'' said his American wife, Christy, in her first year of
teaching third grade at Sandia Heights Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very laid-back,'' she said of her husband and Kenyans
in general. ``They're not rushed and stressed like we are here.
They have no concept of time, basically. I know I'm a type A
personality. He always helps me relax and calm down. I help him to
be on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Christy Harmon was a walk-on runner from Albuquerque at Lubbock
Christian who eventually earned a scholarship partly because of the
inspiration she found in the Kenyans. ``I wanted to be like them
and run like them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Kenya in the summer of 1992, Christy visited Bungei
at his parents' blue stucco house and subsistence farm in the town
of Kapsabet. She remembers the stunning green hills, a mud hut
kitchen and the strictness of James' father, a policeman who spoke
only Kalenjin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go out and take pictures before it got dark and
he kept saying, `No, you have to sit here and eat your food,' ''
Christy said. ``We had to do everything exactly like he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   When his father died of cancer three years ago, James as the
oldest son became the provider for his mother and five siblings.
</P>
<P>
   That was soon after his storied career at Lubbock Christian (23
All-America awards, member of seven national-championship teams)
came to an uncertain end because of a torn left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get to run for nine months so when I moved down here,
I was nothing,'' he said. ``I didn't know if I was going to get my
career back.''
</P>
<P>
   To support Christy and their son, Preston, born in February
1995, Bungei took a job at a Kenny Rogers Roasters restaurant.
Another Kenyan brought him to Hellebuyck. ``I threw him a couple of
pair of shoes,'' and encouragement until he became healthy, she
said. ``I give him credit, he was willing to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The road titles, including his first two in Phoenix, began to
come in late 1995. He finished 1996 ranked sixth in the world by
``Runner's World.'' In 1997, an off year overall, he ran a 13:16
5K, fourth best on the road all-time.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 season includes sub-1:02 half marathons in Las Vegas
and Rio de Janiero and course-record half marathon performances in
Toronto and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I've been so successful is my wife has
graduated,'' from the College of Santa Fe, Bungei said. ``For the
past three years, she was still going to school and I was the only
one supporting the family. Sometimes you are under pressure, you
need to go out and perform. This year, I'm more relaxed. We are not
dependent only on my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Which has Bungei thinking about a move to the marathon, where
the big money is to be had. A top-three finish at any major
marathon is worth approximately $50,000, as much as Bungei earns in
a year's worth of shorter road races.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is actually one up in the marathon category. Christy
gutted her way through the Suzuki Rock 'N Roll Marathon in San
Diego five months ago. Her report to James: ``It's not that bad,
you should do one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bungei is not easily fooled. He knows the difference between a
1:01 half-marathon and a world-class marathon (sub 2:10) is
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Hellebuyck sees Bungei at a career crossroad: ``It's not
that he fears longer distance, but he's a front-runner. The
marathon is all about patience, and sometimes he's missing
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bungei's marathon debut could come Jan. 17 in Houston, with a
total prize purse of $150,000, or Feb. 7 in Las Vegas, which pays
its champion $5,000. He plans to race twice this year after the
Phoenix 10K, then hedges on the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they are out there,'' Bungei said of Kenyan marathon
champions such as John Kagwe and Ondoro Osoro, ``and that you have
potential to be up there with them. You must push yourself, push
yourself.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ANOTHER NO. 23 WHO PLAYS LIKE MIKE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The player they call Meek has apparently inherited another
women's college basketball season. And if the locked-out men's
professionals ever inspire David Stern to open his doors, there
will, according to the leading indicators, be an abbreviated return
engagement by the marketing machine named Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Rack up those No. 23 jerseys. Mike and Meek, a mutual admiration
society of two, are looking for another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, Meek,'' said Mike, picking Chamique Holdsclaw right out of
a crowd of Tennessee Lady Vols last winter in Chicago, when
basketball's first lady accompanied her teammates to a prearranged
audience with the sport's leading man.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House last Monday, President Clinton demonstrated
how, these days, one morning briefing is enough to become an
instant basketball expert, popular with men and women voters. While
honoring Tennessee's national champions, he noted that Holdsclaw
was her team's leading scorer and her sport's player of the year.
``Incidentally,'' the president added, ``she was wearing No. 23.
Like Michael Jordan, she dominated every game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It was stylish, yet predictable, which, it seems to me, is one
significant reason beyond the resentment of the rank-and-file rich
man why so few fans claim to not miss Jordan and his supporting
cast of 300-plus. People have seen the movie already, and know how
it ends.
</P>
<P>
   I suspected last spring that Holdsclaw would come to a similar
conclusion and forgo her senior season, after three national
titles, and with Stern's women's league ready to offer Madison
Square Garden in her native New York. Holdsclaw could have pocketed
at least a couple of hundred grand and been back in Knoxville by
now, finishing her degree. Somehow, against such impeccable logic,
Pat Summitt lured back her star, which gives you an idea of her
persuasive powers, and what the rest of the women's game is
typically up against.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing shy or retiring about Holdsclaw and her catchy
cast of supporting Meeks _ Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall _
but here's hoping that a challenge can at least be mounted to
Summitt's Lady Vols as they work toward their fourth straight
national championship and Summitt works on her third consecutive
as-told-to book. Otherwise, this promises to be another one-note
season, even if the note happens to be about as high as collegiate
women have played.
</P>
<P>
   The women have more visibility than ever and two professional
leagues to audition for, but their Final Four showcase last spring
was a one-sided snooze. On a qualitative scale, they are where the
men's game was back when John Wooden's UCLA teams knew they could
only be beaten by an outbreak of academic ineligibility. Until more
schools win national championships, as in the more balanced men's
college game, the women will be tenuous everywhere but in isolated
hotbeds like Tennessee and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do any better, obviously,'' said Summitt, referring
to Tennessee's run of 39 straight victories last season, by an
average of more than 30 points. That's because, she admitted, there
is no mathematical possibility of playing as many games. Road trips
to Connecticut, Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion may present serious
obstacles to another perfect season, but Summitt said her goal is
merely ``reaching the final game,'' and obviously winning it as
comfortably as Tennessee did when it crushed La Tech by 18 last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never, never,'' she said when asked if winning gets
boring, but there certainly can be a numbing effect to Same Story
Syndrome. That's what the National Basketball Association is
suffering from, no matter what deal Stern eventually cuts with the
union. Or maybe the owners have agreed they have ridden the
Jordan/Bulls story line as far as they can, and, with no compelling
alternatives, they are willing to junk the season altogether, teach
these players a lesson, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   I keep hearing how the NBA is playing with fire, risking
Jordan's retirement wrath, which I know for a fact makes most
owners laugh. They already have what they wanted from Jordan's
ratings popularity, their four-year, $2.4 billion network
television package. By the time they begin negotiating their next
deal in three years, they will need a new set of stars to sell. The
longer Jordan stays around with a championship cast, the harder it
is to get people to pay positive attention to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary of the consensus opinion that the NBA will sink
without Jordan, two years after he's gone, it won't look like a
league filled so many failures anymore. It is not healthy for any
sport to live off one player, one team, one theme. With all due
respect to Mike and Meek, there is a limit to how many seasons we
can take that read like a script.

COLLEGES MAY TARGET LESSER TALENTS WHO WILL STAY LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are enough familiar schools at the top of the preseason
men's polls (Duke, Connecticut) to comfort college basketball
aficionados. There are some names on the all-America lists (Elton
Brand, Richard Hamilton) that promise electrifying drama as the
season arcs toward one more show-stopping national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So will college basketball be good? And, more important, is
college basketball well?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, no one rushes in with a resounding ``yes'' to
either question. The men's game is changing at warp speed, and some
of its most respected caretakers aren't sure they are equipped to
keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of players who left college early to join the
National Basketball Association has become a stampede, as even high
school players insist on drop-stepping straight to the pros. North
Carolina's Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter were among eight players
who left college early and were drafted in the National Basketball
Association's top 10 picks last spring; one of them, Larry Hughes,
left St. Louis after his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   Point-shaving scandals surfaced at Arizona State and
Northwestern, reminders of how easily these threats can take hold
in a supercharged atmosphere. Constant recruiting violations;
criminal behavior off the court; summer leagues for high school
players in which many teams pay for play _ all threaten to knock
college basketball off its wobbly pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game is in great shape and it is in poor shape,'' said
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, president of the National Association
of Basketball Coaches. ``On the court, it is played passionately at
a high level. But it's getting knocked back and back because the
rules governing college basketball haven't kept up with this
fast-break of changes. The house is still beautiful, but we may
have termites.''
</P>
<P>
   Those changes _ especially the early flight of players to the
NBA _ have already affected everything from coaching and recruiting
philosophies to the caliber of play. No one suggests they are
killing the game, but they are dramatically reshaping how coaches
assemble and run their teams _ and how good those teams are.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has been to the Final Four seven times and won two
national championships. His current Blue Devil team is rated No. 1
in most preseason polls, which he believes is an honest assessment
of a talented bunch. But Krzyzewski doesn't hesitate to say that
the Johnny Dawkins-led 1986 national runner-up was much better, and
that the Christian Laettner-Grant Hill back-to-back national
champions of 1991 and '92 were better still.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a narrowing of the gap between the top 10 teams
to, what, the top 100 or so because of how fluid things are,'' he
said. ``But there's no doubt the dominant teams, in the days when
kids stayed all four years, played better basketball than today.
The downside was that there was a greater gap between these
dominant teams and everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring's National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, as well as this year's preseason favorites, illustrate
the shifting dynamic. A senior-laden team from tiny Valparaiso
drove into the round of 16. Rhode Island, with an unheralded,
veteran backcourt of Tyson Wheeler and Cuttino Mobley, made it to
the round of eight. Stanford and Utah, neither with a super talent,
made the Final Four and the Utes lost in the final to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the guys who have left North Carolina and
Kentucky, and you wonder if you can get kids a level below that and
keep them four years,'' said Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery. ``Look
at the Rhode Island guards. I don't know where they were drafted,
but they weren't lottery picks and they took them to the brink of
the Final Four.'' Mobley and Wheeler were both drafted in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's Stanford team returns 11 lettermen, five seniors,
all of its starters; it is projected to contend for the title. In
fact, the top spots in the preseason polls are crowded with teams
from which most people could not name a star. Washington, Xavier,
Tennessee and Temple are hardly known for producing lottery picks
among their younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in together and then stay, you experience the
same difficulties and joys and it makes you closer,'' said Mark
Seaton, the Stanford senior forward, summing up the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches concede that it makes for a far better team, too,
and most have accepted that having a super talent who is around for
his senior year is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's point guard, Andre Miller, is one, but his choice made
sense because he did not begin to create lottery buzz until late in
Utah's superb season.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun has lost Ray Allen and Donyell
Marshall early to the draft, and last spring he almost lost Richard
Hamilton, the Big East player of the year. Hamilton, now a junior,
decided to return. He, along with the sophomore Khalid El-Amin,
gives the Huskies perhaps their best chance ever to crack the Final
Four. There is a sense of urgency _ both will probably be gone
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Like most coaches, Calhoun says he does not recruit the
Hamiltons and El-Amins believing they will leave early. But
somewhere along the way, the hard truth sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done a study of theater, but I don't know what
happens if a brilliant young actor in his junior year decides to
leave,'' said Calhoun, who believes the college game must just
soldier on. ``I don't know if it's particularly bad for the
symphony at the university when someone gifted goes on. People
don't necessarily have to see superstars. They have to see super
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition on the court remains of high quality, but
Krzyzewski argues that those who govern the game need to be more
active in identifying potential problems and solving them. One of
the boldest proposals comes from the Big Ten commissioner, Jim
Delany, who suggested making freshmen and junior college transfers
ineligible, eliminating summer recruiting and encouraging the NBA
to set up a minor league for athletes not interested in college.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate just how quick things come up, Krzyzewski likes to
tell of how in the summer of 1990, before Grant Hill's freshman
year at Duke, no one ever asked Hill if he intended to play
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in his 18 years at Duke, Krzyzewski has
a player _ Brand _ who is not very likely to stay all four years
and graduate with his class. Brand has been asked about the NBA
since he was a sophomore in high school.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a sure-fire, three-prong recruiting pitch,
Krzyzewski says, has become partly obsolete. ``I could tell them:
One, you'll become a better player here. Two, you'll earn a degree
_ a real one, not one to keep you eligible. Three, in four years
you'll make more money as a player _ the bottom line will improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now only the first two are true.''
</P>
<P>
   So come tournament time, older teams with slightly lesser talent
may keep going deeper than expected. The superstars can't afford to
stay around.
</P>

10 REASONS TO HATE COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently sensing that I, too, was caught up in the hype
surrounding Sunday's Cardinals-Cowboys game, my editor came to me
with a thought: Did I have strong feelings about Dallas?
</P>
<P>
   Could I come up with something to write about the game? How
about a Top 10 list of reasons to hate the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   Ha! As a lifelong Redskins fan, I sensed only one problem _
could I keep the list to 10? Normally I hate it when anyone other
than David Letterman does a Top 10 list, but this was too inviting
to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Could we make this a six-part series? I can think of 53 reasons
right off the top of my head, just by going down the team's roster.
</P>
<P>
   We could go way back. I could do a book on how Clint Longley's
heroics alone once spoiled an entire Thanksgiving (although bad
clams may have contributed to the problem).
</P>
<P>
   Everybody hates the Cowboys. Except for all the people who love
them. They're the football equivalent of escargot. You consider
them the epitome of good taste or a bunch of slime-trailing insects
(and I'm talking about the Cowboys here, not the snails).
</P>
<P>
   You're either thrilled or disgusted by them; there is no middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   My only regret is that Barry Switzer is no longer the ``brains''
behind the team (``far'' behind the team). When you start to write
something making fun of the Cowboys and realize Switzer's ridden
off into the sunset, you begin to understand why Bill Clinton is
saddened by Newt Gingrich's departure. We all need someone to
compare ourselves favorably to.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Jerry Jones is still around.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you have to grudgingly admit, one reason the Cowboys are
so popular is because they've won so much. Their bandwagon makes
the one driven by the Chicago Bulls' success look like a Hyundai.
Five Super Bowl victories are nothing to scoff at.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you hate the Cowboys, in which case you'll
scoff at anything associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with a history of success are also fun to hate, but
there is a small part of you that secretly likes to see them do
well every now and then. The New York Yankees come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys aren't like that. I cannot imagine rooting for them
in any circumstance, and that includes if they had fought against
the British in the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't mean I think the Cardinals will win the
game. Are you nuts? Bet the house on Dallas. And hate yourself for
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   So, without further ado, I present the Top 10 reasons to hate
the Dallas Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 10: Super Bowls VI, XII, XXVII, XXVIII and XXX.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 9: Obnoxious fans who gloat when team wins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 8: Obnoxious fans who whine when team loses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 7: Roger Staubach, a man so self-righteous he makes Steve
Largent look like Bill Clinton. (Extra points for beating the
Redskins all those times.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 6: Maddening habit of building up hopes by achieving a .500
record, then losing in embarrassing fashion the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, that's the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 5: Not the fact that ``The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,'' a
two-hour made-for-television movie that aired in 1979, was made in
the first place (it may have been Bert Convy's finest moment; a
pre-``Dr. Quinn'' Jane Seymour was also a cast member). The fact
that there was a sequel the following year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 4: Michael Irvin's tonsorial talents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 3: Jerry Jones roaming the sidelines at games, looking like
he would steal gruel from an orphanage if he thought he could make
a buck off of it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No. 2: Starting the ridiculous trend of wearing white jerseys
for home games.
</P>
<P>
   And the  &UR; No. 1 reason to hate the Dallas Cowboys: That Deion
Sanders scores too many touchdowns! &QL;

RIVALS SAY TENNESSEE IS STILL THE TEAM TO BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beauty of sports is that no matter how unbeatable someone
looks, there is no sure thing. The 49ers and the Packers lose.
Tiger Woods and Martina Hingis lose. Later or maybe sooner, the
Yankees and the Bulls will lose.
</P>
<P>
   But will the Tennessee women's basketball team ever lose? The
Lady Vols have won 45 consecutive games and the last three national
championships. In separate preseason polls, 42 news media members
and 40 coaches have unanimously chosen them to repeat. Even such
major rivals as Louisiana Tech and Connecticut say that Tennessee
seems almost a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech, with its great basketball tradition, has the
depth and up-tempo game to challenge Tennessee, but Coach Leon
Barmore said Tennessee was so deep that it could probably beat an
all-star team from all the other colleges combined. And as Geno
Auriemma, the UConn coach, said, ``The only thing that would hurt
Tennessee is if they lose interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They put better players out there,'' Auriemma said. ``That's
75 percent of the battle. They've got tremendous players. They've
got a tradition where they're expected to win and they expect to
win. They've got terrific coaching. They play hard. They know what
they're doing. Before you walk on the court against them, you have
to believe you're a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut may not be a better team, not yet, anyway, but it
has exciting possibilities. For all of Pat Summitt's huge coaching
success at Tennessee, Auriemma has also had a big run at UConn,
with the best record in the nation (166-11) over the last five
seasons. His teams have played in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament the last 10 seasons and have won the Big
East regular-season and tournament titles the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tennessee has the best player around in 6-foot-2-inch
Chamique Holdsclaw, and all those gifted sophomores, UConn has
great potential from its latest superstar in waiting and a freshman
class almost as promising as Tennessee's was last year.
</P>
<P>
   If UConn is to threaten Tennessee for national supremacy, it
must get peak performances from many players. Start with its 6-2
Russian, Svetlana Abrosimova. Last year, as a 17-year-old freshman
struggling in a strange country, she was tough on and off the
court. She would stay up to 4 a.m. writing papers in a language she
was still trying to master, and then she would play basketball with
stunning offensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five seasons, UConn has turned out such
all-Americans and national players of the year as Rebecca Lobo,
Jennifer Rizzotti, Kara Wolters and Nykesha Sales. Comfortable or
not, and she is not thrilled by it, Abrosimova is the designated
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to be great because she can be,'' Auriemma said.
``There's not much she can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova is resigned to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel people are expecting me to be the best player on the
team,'' she said. ``I don't think seriously about it. I don't want
to force anything, just do my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova likes to handle the ball, and Auriemma kids her about
it. ``Whenever we do defensive drills,'' he said, ``she comes up
with an injury that sends her to the trainer's room. When we do
offensive drills, she has a miraculous recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Abrosimova, UConn's best returning players are 6-5
Paige Sauer, who is becoming a dominant post player; 5-11 Amy
Duran, an outside gunner, and 6-0 Shea Ralph, whose fiery drives to
the basket have not been tamed by two reconstructions of her right
knee five months apart.
</P>
<P>
   Enter that gifted freshman class of five high school
all-Americans. Three of them _ Swin Cash, Tamika Williams and Asjha
(pronounced Asia) Jones _ are 6-2 power forwards. The two others _
5-9 Sue Bird and 5-8 Keirsten Walters _ are guards. At the moment,
Bird, a shooting guard in high school, is starting at point guard
and Cash at forward. Auriemma said all five were playing
instinctively and learning quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to contribute significantly on a
regular basis,'' he said. ``It may not be realistic to expect all
of them to be great every day, but we need two or three every day,
every game. Some days, all five will play terrific and the
returning guys will, too, and we'll look terrific. And some days
we're going to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshmen are good and they have personalities that fit in.
You never see that attitude that if I don't get the ball three or
four times in a row, I'm going to break out in a rash. They've been
around. They've played overseas. It's a different world from when
kids thought they needed a visa to get from New Hampshire to
Storrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph sat out last season after her two potentially
career-ending knee operations. Now, as in her freshman year, she
will probably be the first player off the bench. She acknowledges
she has lost a step, but her enthusiasm, which had always been near
the boiling point, is undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how much I loved basketball,'' she said, ``until
it was taken away from me. I feel like I've been given a second
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma marvels at her return.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to be Barry Sanders: get the ball, weave, get to the
basket, score, get fouled,'' he said. ``Now she's more like
Ironhead Heyward: put your shoulder down and run over people. We're
trying to get her to be a combination of the two.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good Ralph and her teammates become, Tennessee's
veteran team, 39-0 last season, looms large. The starters are
Holdsclaw, the senior small forward; Kellie Jolly, the underrated
senior point guard, and three of those super sophomores _ the 6-1
power forward Tamika Catchings, the 5-10 shooting guard Semeka
Randall and the 6-3 center Teresa Geter.
</P>
<P>
   The only place the Lady Vols needed help was at center, because
6-3 LaShonda Stephens, last year's starter, is sidelined by
arthritic knees. Their only two recruits were centers _ 6-5
Michelle Snow and 6-3 Shalon Pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt seems worried about complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not as strong a team as you saw in March,''
she said. ``This team looks very human, very beatable at times. It
puzzles me that it is not the defensive team I'm accustomed to. We
need to get back to a blue-collar mentality and influence
opponents. For the first time with this group, I'm concerned about
a lack of commitment to defense and rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Summitt's fears or rhetoric, her fellow coaches say
Tennessee's dominance is good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the men's collegiate game really took off,'' said Coach
Chris Gobrecht of Southern California, ``is when all the Cinderella
teams started to appear in the tournament. Schools began to realize
anybody could do this. They could all share in this magic. It began
to intrigue the general public so much.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coach Joe Ciampi of Auburn said: ``I'm not tired of talking
about Tennessee. You need an example of what you're shooting for.
Size is still important, but it really comes down to having players
with the right combination of athletic ability and basketball
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has that. As Summitt said, ``I feel pressure when we
don't have players.''

CAPSULE PROFILES OF THE TOP 16 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Drape chooses 16 teams with the weapons and the nerve to
make a run at the Final Four, which will be at St. Petersburg's
Tropicana Field. (Last season's record in parentheses.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Team Standing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stanford (30-5) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three all-America candidates _ point guard Arthur Lee, forward
Mark Madsen and and the 7-foot-1-inch center Tim Young _ are among
11 lettermen returning from last season's Final Four Team. In the
seniors Lee (14.5 points, 4.6 assists a game) and Kris Weems (12.6
points), the Cardinal boasts the headiest backcourt in the nation.
In addition to Madsen (11.7 points, 8.2 rebounds) and Young (11.3
points, 8.1 rebounds), who will break Adam Keefe's school
rebounding record this season, Peter Sauer (9.2 points, 4.6
rebounds) returns to an equally heady front line. The twins Jason
and Jarron Collins add front-court athleticism off the bench.
Stanford has all the ingredients; all that remains to be seen is
how it withstands the pressure of being a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three That Could Meet in St. Pete &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Connecticut (32-5) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The only player in the way of Richard Hamilton (21.5 ppg)
repeating as Big East player of the year is his point guard, Khalid
El-Amin, who was the Big East rookie of the year and averaged 23
points in four national tournament games. El-Amin will trigger one
of Coach Jim Calhoun's deepest and most talented teams; all five
starters are back, and last season's run to the final eight gave
them seasoning. The key to the Huskies' first visit to the Final
Four is consistent play from two juniors, 6-11 Jake Voskuhl (6.9
points, 7.1 rebounds) and 6-7 Kevin Freeman (10.3 points, 6.6
rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Duke (32-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Krzyzewski calls this season's Blue Devils, virtually
everyone's preseason No. 1, one of his most talented teams. The
fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon is an all-American who shoots
better than 40 percent from 3-point range and is the on-court
vessel for the Blue Devils' heritage of defense and will to win.
The 6-9, 270-pound sophomore Elton Brand is probably this season's
player of the year _ he missed 15 games as a freshman with a broken
foot, but still averaged 13.4 points and 7.3 rebounds. Duke also
returns the junior Chris Carrawell (10.1 points) and the sophomore
defensive stopper Shane Battier, who demonstrated offensive skills
when Brand was down: 7.6 points a game on 54 percent shooting. The
sophomore William Avery takes over at point guard for Steve
Wojciechowski, and his growth will determine how far the Blue
Devils go.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Washington (20-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The other Huskies came within a point of beating Connecticut and
advancing to the round of eight last year. Coach Bob Bender is a
Krzyzewski protege and has ingrained the Duke toughness in a team
that may have the best individual talent in the Pacific-10. The
7-foot Canadian Todd MacCulloch (18.6 points, 9.7 rebounds) has led
the nation in field-goal percentage twice. Guards Donald Watts and
Deon Luton combined for 32 points a game. The Pac-10 may be the
best conference in the nation, and the Huskies will be well prepped
for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four That Could Knock on the Door &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michigan State (22-8) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves (16.1 points, 7.2 assists), a player of the year
candidate, is the best thing that has happened to Spartan
basketball since Magic Johnson. The 6-2 junior leads a team rare
for the Big Ten: it is as graceful as it is bruising. The senior
Jason Klein (11.2 points) shot 41.1 percent from beyond the 3-point
line. Another senior, Antonio Smith (7.9 points, 8.7 rebounds),
helped Michigan State outrebound Big Ten opponents by nearly 9 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kentucky (35-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The defending national champion lost its leading scorer, Jeff
Sheppard; its force in the middle, Nazr Mohammed, and a classy
starter in Allen Edwards. But forward Scott Padgett is a star to
build around. He was third on the team in scoring (11.5 points),
second in rebounds (6.5) and steals and shot 85 percent from the
foul line. Coach Tubby Smith has made five consecutive trips to the
round of 16 with three different teams; the Wildcats will be ready
at tournament time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Temple (21-9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Owls will never be up tempo, but they will have more pop
than any of John Chaney's recent teams. Lamont Barnes (13.8 points,
8 rebounds) has plenty of help inside with the addition of the 6-10
McDonald's all-American Kevin Lyde. Another McDonald's honoree,
Mark Karcher, averaged 27 points in 1996-97 at Baltimore's St.
Francis Academy before sitting out last season. Temple benefits
from playing in the ultra-competitive Atlantic 10, which put five
teams in the tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Indiana (20-12) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight should have one of his most talented and athletic
Hoosier teams in years. The junior A.J. Guyton averaged 16.8 points
and shot 43.9 percent from 3-point range; he is the only Indiana
player other than Isiah Thomas to produce at least 400 points, 100
rebounds and 100 assists in each of his first two seasons. The
sophomore Luke Recker (12.8 points) leads a brigade of quick
swingmen, including Michigan's 1997 Mr. Basketball, Dane Fife. The
Hoosiers will challenge Michigan State for the Big Ten title.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eight That Could Hang Around Late &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tennessee (20-9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, not the Lady Vols. Coach Jerry Green returns all five
starters from a team that last season made its first tournament
appearance since 1989. Guards Tony Harris (14.2 points) and Brandon
Wharton (15.2 points) lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maryland (21-11) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Terps are led by a couple of self-made stars in Obinna
Ekezie and Laron Profit. They have improved each year, and along
with Terrell Stokes they give Gary Williams solid leadership for a
deep run in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Utah (30-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Majerus will let Andre Miller loose because he has
to. Miller, the point guard and player of the year candidate, and
the 6-10 Finnish forward Hanno Mottola (12.5 points, 5.3 rebounds)
are the only seasoned contributors remaining from last season's
tournament runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Arkansas (24-9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The senior backcourt of Kareem Reid and Pat Bradley makes the
Hogs dangerous at tournament time. Reid is an assist king; Bradley
(14.8 points) led the Southeastern Conference in 3-point goals the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kansas (35-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Low expectations are what the Jayhawks need to exorcise the
demons of early tournament exits. Ryan Robertson (8.3 points, 6.4
assists) looks like a prototypical Kansas point guard. But the 6-8
power forward Lester Earl, who transferred two years ago from
Louisiana State, might be the undisciplined spark that Jayhawk
basketball needs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; North Carolina (34-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cota and Ademola Okulaja are not at the same level as the
departed Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison. But Coach Bill Guthridge
will rely on them while he tries to bring the freshman Jason Capel
and Ronald Curry, the football team's quarterback, around in time
to make the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UCLA (24-9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If Baron Davis is truly recovered from knee surgery, his court
savvy _ 11.7 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists a game, plus 77
steals _ could hold together a remarkably young and talented team.
The 6-11 freshman Dan Gadzuric could be the Bruins' best big man
since Bill Walton. Also in the recruiting class, considered the
nation's best: the 6-11 power forward Jerome Moiso and the 6-7
slasher JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Texas Christian (27-6) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lee Nailon entered the National Basketball Association draft,
then reconsidered and brought his 24.9 points a game back to Fort
Worth. The dependable point guard Prince Fowler will get him the
ball. Coach Billy Tubbs has reloaded with junior college transfers
for his brand of ball: pressure defense, run up the score.

CAPSULE PROFILES OF THE WOMEN'S TOP 16 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Litsky chooses 16 teams that might have what it takes to
reach the women's Final Four at the San Jose Arena next March.
(Last season's record in parentheses.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Team Standing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tennessee (39-0) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Vols lost 10 games and still won the national
tournament. Last year, with the best freshman class ever, they went
unbeaten and won the title again. This year, they are riding a
45-game winning streak and looking for another national title from
6-foot-2-inch Chamique Holdsclaw, the best female player in college
and maybe anywhere, and the 6-2 forward Tamika Catchings and the
5-10 guard Semeka Randall, the best of last year's freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three That Could Find the Way to San Jose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Louisiana Tech (31-4) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last season's National Collegiate Athletic Association finalist
should be even better, with an up-tempo team eight or nine players
deep. Four starters return, led by the 6-0 forward Amanda Wilson
(18.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game, with a 62 percent shooting
average). But as Coach Leon Barmore said, ``You could put all the
rest of us together and not beat Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Connecticut (34-3) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have lost their dominating backcourt of the
all-American Nykesha Sales and Rita Williams, but they will get
quick help from this year's best recruiting class. Svetlana
Abrosimova, the 6-2 sophomore forward from Russia, is a superstar
in the making, and the 6-0 forward-guard Shea Ralph is back after
two right-knee reconstructions in five months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Duke (24-8) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 players return from a round-of-eight team that gets
better by the year. They include twin-tower centers in 6-6 Michele
VanGorp and 6-4 Payton Black. Games against Connecticut, Tennessee
and Notre Dame will test this team before its tough schedule in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four That Could Knock on the Door &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UCLA (20-9) &LR;  &QL; 
The Bruins are still angry over their controversial loss to Alabama
in last year's NCAA tournament. They should be the new power in the
Pacific 10 with a veteran team, especially if the 6-3 power forward
Maylana Martin (18.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.4 assists) overcomes a
bad back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Purdue (23-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen players return from a team that missed last season's
Final Four by only 7 points. The backbone is the backcourt duo of
Stephanie White-McCarty (20.6 points a game) and Ukari Figgs
(15.5).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alabama (24-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Only two starters return, but the freshman class should help.
The key is Dominique Canty, a 5-10 guard/forward who averaged 21.5
points a game last year and may be the best collegiate player not
at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; North Carolina (27-7) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels scared Tennessee in an NCAA regional final last
season, and they remain deep despite the graduation of the
all-American Tracy Reid. One concern: the 6-5 freshman LaShonda
Allen is the only player taller than 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eight That Could Hang Around Late &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Virginia (19-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DeMya Walker, a 6-2 power forward (16.3 points, 8.4 rebounds)
must take command. The 6-0 forward Monick Foote and the 5-8 guard
Tiffany Bower return after missing last season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rutgers (22-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This may be another breakthrough year for the Scarlet Knights,
who return everyone from last season's round-of-16 team. The best
part of this deep, quick team is the backcourt of 5-6 Tasha Pointer
and 5-10 Tomora Young.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Texas Tech (26-5) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The all-American Alicia Thompson (23.3 points) is gone, but four
senior starters return to the best team in the Big 12. Now the
offensive burden falls on Angie Braziel, a 6-3 post player with new
international experience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Georgia (17-11) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last season was not typical because the freshmen had to play,
ready or not. The team is still young but better, especially with
the 5-10 twins Kelly and Coco Miller at guard. Tawana McDonald, a
6-4 freshman center, should help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kansas (23-9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks, with nine straight 20-victory seasons, are solid
again. The five starters return, led by 6-2 Lynn Pride, a shooting
guard-small forward. Two newcomers, 6-6 Kristen Geoffrey and 6-5
Dalchon Brown, provide size.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; North Carolina State (25-7) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Wolfpack upset Old Dominion and Connecticut and
reached the Final Four. Five perimeter players return, but the 6-6
center Summer Erb must replace Chasity Melvin as a commanding force
inside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stanford (21-6) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Those dominant inside players _ Olympia Scott, Heather Owen,
Kristen Folkl, Vanessa Nygaard and Naomi Mulitauaopele _ are gone,
and the 6-0 senior forward Regan Freuen and the 6-1 freshman guard
Lindsey Yamasaki are injured. Still, Stanford will be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notre Dame (22-10) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it was a surprising Final Four trip. Last year,
although rebuilding, the Irish made the round of 16. Four starters
return from that team, led by the 5-10 guard Sheila McMillen, a
40-percent 3-point shooter.

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WITH BCS

 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week ago, the buzz in college football was about what would
happen if there were four undefeated teams at the top of the polls
at the end of the year. There was considerable speculation about
how the Bowl Championship Series ratings would work and which teams
would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohio State's loss last week startled everyone back to the
reality of just how difficult it is to go undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are three undefeated teams at the top of the polls,
and each has a difficult schedule ahead. The odds are that at least
one will lose again, and it's not inconceivable that all could lose
in the closing weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To make it to the Fiesta Bowl, No. 1 rated Tennessee likely will
have to beat No. 10 Arkansas twice, today in Knoxville, Tenn., and
Dec. 5 in Atlanta in the Southeastern Conference title game. The
Volunteers also have games left against Kentucky and Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Kansas State might have the toughest road ahead. The
Wildcats have to beat No. 11 Nebraska today in Manahattan, Kan.,
No. 13 Missouri on the road next week before likely taking on No. 6
Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 title game Dec. 5 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA is the shakiest of the three. The Bruins have barely
won their past four games, and Washington could give them trouble
today. Next week, UCLA takes on Southern California, which has a
bye this week in which to prepare, before traveling to Miami on
Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   A loss by any of the top three widens the possibilities for the
next tier of teams, including Florida State, Florida, Wisconsin and
Arizona, which would move closer to contention. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bowl picture &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Rose Bowl might have to turn its back on longtime relationships
to have anything other than a traditional match-up between teams
from the Pac-10 and Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's loss last week assured the Big Ten of a spot in the
Rose Bowl. Wisconsin will earn the berth if it wins out against
Michigan today and Penn State next week. Michigan would earn a
return trip to Pasadena, Calif., by beating Wisconsin and Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes still have an outside chance, but it would take
victories over Iowa and Michigan and two losses by Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the Rose Bowl match-up is more intriguing.
Arizona must hope that UCLA either wins out and plays for the
national title in the Fiesta Bowl, or loses its next two games.
</P>
<P>
   Two UCLA losses and Arizona victories over California and
Arizona State would put the Wildcats in the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA makes it to the Fiesta, the Rose would be free to choose
any other available team. But Rose Bowl officials would strain some
relationships if they turned their backs on an 11-1 Arizona team
that was ranked in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave Notre Dame to be picked by either the Sugar or
Orange bowls, provided the Fighting Irish don't lose again. There
has been speculation that the Irish wouldn't be selected by any of
the BCS bowls, but chances are ABC, which televises the four BCS
bowls, would have something to say about that. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Husker hysteria  &QL; 
 &QL; 
They are 9-0, lead the nation in scoring offense and defense and
have won games by an average of 52-7. Still, doubts linger about
the credibility of Kansas State, which pads its record by feasting
on a buffet of pastries disguised as non-conference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats could quiet many of the doubters if they beat
11th-ranked Nebraska today. The Wildcats haven't beaten the
Cornhuskers since 1968. Nebraska gave Kansas State its only loss
last year, a 56-26 whipping in Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder, normally about as exciting as
Wal-Mart on a Saturday night, isn't getting too hyped up over
today's game.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to call it a benchmark for his program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things I'd like to have more than this,''
he said in his weekly news conference Tuesday. ``A healthy family,
peace in this country. But is this important to me? Why, shoot yes.
It's extremely important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's extremely important to Nebraska, too. The Cornhuskers are
trying deal with life after two losses. They have read and heard
the storyline of the game, that a Kansas State victory would signal
a change in the balance of power in the Big 12, and are determined
not to let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what's riding on this game, as far as making a
statement that our program is not going downhill,'' Nebraska
linebacker Jay Foreman said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No vacancy &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stanford has lost 13 of its past 15 games, including 8 of 9 this
season. Some people down on The Farm would like to see Coach Tyrone
Willingham fired at the end of the season, but that's not going to
happen, Athletic Director Ted Leland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we are Stanford, and we do things a little
differently,'' Leland told the San Francisco Examiner. ``The other
thing is the kind of man Tyrone is. Anybody who rubs up against him
knows that in the long run we have the right guy running the
football program.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a prudent stand by Leland, who signed Willingham to a
five-year contract extension last season. And next year, the
Cardinal will return 10 starters on defense and nine on offense. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
 &QL; 
Florida Coach Steve Spurrier took a little shot at Vanderbilt after
the Gators won last week, 45-13. ``Vandy's corners covered pretty
well. They covered our backup receivers like a blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has often been criticized for running up the score but
he said he can take it, too. When Florida was getting hammered,
62-24, by Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl, Spurrier said he wanted to
tell Cornhuskers Coach Tom Osborne not to let up. ``We deserved to
get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   No undefeated team is enjoying its status more than Tulane
because it wasn't that long ago that the Green Wave was getting
pounded weekly. ``Two years ago, one reporter showed up every week
and we were really glad to see him,'' quarterback Shaun King said.
``No one paid any attention to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's Snyder, never a media darling, hasn't let
quarterback Michael Bishop talk to the media since late September.
He made an exception this week for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers Coach Terry Shea deserves some consideration for
post-season honors. Rutgers, which went 0-11 last season, is 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie isn't worrying about bowl scenarios.
``You can't sit there and wish and want and hope. You have to go
out and win. So rather than discuss scenarios, you have to figure
out a way to stop the fullback.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were cheers in the White House when this year's election
returns came in. Across Capitol Hill and across the nation,
Democrats seized on the results _ five new seats in Congress, the
toppling of some of the nation's most conservative senators, a few
gains across the South _ as if they were the first signs of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was, in retrospect, peculiar, for two reasons: The
first is that the Democratic Party has arguably not undergone the
kind of rejuvenation that some of its leaders discerned in the
results of Nov. 3. And the second is, even if it has, there are
good reasons why its leaders might not want to get too excited
about it.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one recurring lesson in U.S. politics over the past
decade, it is that few things are more hazardous than success.
Politicians are forever ignoring history, claiming mandates that
voters never intended and then paying a price for their
miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   It took President Clinton almost two years to recover from his
failed effort to persuade Congress to adopt a national health care
plan, inspired by the exuberant reaction the idea got when he
broached it in New Hampshire in 1992. The seeds of House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's demise were planted when he and the Republicans won
control of Congress in 1994 and confidently proceeded to overplay
their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Clinton in 1992 and Gingrich in 1994, the
Democrats have clutched at a slender reed this time: Clinton and
Gingrich defeated real opponents, while the Democrats merely beat
expectations, doing better than the Republicans said they would.
Still, Democrats across the country were talking last week about a
new, post-Gingrich political paradigm: the decline of the right and
the ascendancy of a new Democratic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the Democrats, are changed for the next decade, for the
better _ It took us 10 years to learn the lesson,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who upset Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in one of
the contests that most cheered the party.
</P>
<P>
   Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a
centrist group closely identified with Clinton, described the vote
as nothing short of a political coming of age. ``The Clinton-New
Democrat redefining of the center has finally taken hold,'' he
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take another election cycle or two to judge
whether From and Schumer are correct about the ideological remaking
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic leaders, however, have a different
interpretation of the election. And the contrasting views augur a
resurgence of the ideological dissension that Clinton managed to
quiet in 1992 to become president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Clinton took advantage of the fact that the Democrats
had been out of the White House since 1980 and were thus starved
for victory. He could largely ignore liberal Democratic
constituencies and move to the center, where, as he liked to say
back then, elections are won. Gingrich's success in 1994 helped
silence the Democrats' liberal wing again: In that atmosphere of
Republican triumph, it was hard to persuasively argue that the path
back to power was on the left.
</P>
<P>
   But last week it was possible to argue just that. In an
interview, the Rev. Jesse Jackson declared, with considerable
justification, that the Democratic Party had succeeded because its
traditional constituents _ blacks, women, union members _ had come
back to the polls. The election was proof, Jackson said, in a swipe
at Clinton and his supporters, that the party had made a mistake
with what he described as the ``push away from labor, push away
from blacks'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, we put all our players back on the field again _
labor, women, blacks, Hispanics, businesses that have benefited
from growth _ and with our full team we won,'' said Jackson. He
added that he was thinking about running for president again. And
he said he would push the party to embrace universal health care
and to funnel money from criminal justice into school construction.
``I intend between now and the year 2000 to force the party
leadership to come to grips with those issues,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who have been trying to moderate their party's course
and who took the election as a testament to their success said they
were unconcerned by such remarks. Still, it was clear from their
comments last week that they would like to avoid a reprise of the
Democratic infighting that has buoyed Republicans in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constituencies are all too familiar with the liabilities
of being out of office,'' said William Carrick, a Democratic
consultant based in Los Angeles. ``They would much prefer to be
somewhat disappointed by office holders occasionally than be in
love with a bunch of people who weren't in office.''
</P>
<P>
   From, who has enjoyed less than warm relations with Jackson over
the years, said: ``I just don't see a constituency for massive
spending. It doesn't mean people aren't going to be out there
calling for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The display of Democratic self-confidence _ some Democrats are
even predicting the party will take back the House in 2000 _ would
be risky even if the party had enjoyed an extraordinarily
successful election night. But it did not. The Republicans continue
to control both houses of Congress. They hold most governorships.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Democrats the outlook for the 2000 Presidential
election isn't all that great. The Democrats' main contender, Vice
President Al Gore, is, like Clinton, under investigation for
campaign finance abuses, an inquiry that shows no sign of going
away anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the scrutiny means that Gore is unlikely to
reprise some of the more innovative, and effective, methods the
Clinton White House came up with to raise and spend money in the
1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And both Gore and his main rival, House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, are familiar figures in U.S. politics by now _ perhaps
too familiar to voters ready for a change.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrats are taking heart from exceedingly modest
gains. They managed not to slip below 40 seats in the Senate and
give the Republicans a filibuster-proof majority. While they won a
gubernatorial election in California, they lost in Texas, Florida,
Illinois, Michigan and New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic gains this time came largely because of
Republican missteps. It was the Republicans, after all, who allowed
expectations to rise so high that even a modest Democratic showing
was portrayed as a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't notice this election as having been notable _ except
notable for how much the Republicans overestimated,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Republicans who decided, at the last minute, to
shift the focus to Clinton's morals. That was, even Republicans now
say, a political miscalculation of the highest order. ``The joke
here is that Republicans tried to turn it into a referendum on the
president, and the president won,'' said Republican consultant
Stuart Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Stevens was speaking, Republicans were pushing ahead
with impeachment proceedings in Washington. ``The Republicans seem
to be digging themselves in ever deeper,'' said historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr. ``I would think the one thing they learned from the
election is it is a great mistake to extend the impeachment
process. But they seem to have the bit between their teeth on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then it might not matter how much
skirmishing the Democrats do in their moment of almost-victory. The
Republicans might help them out again.

MIDGET RACER KEEPS EYE ON INDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Leffler has spent his career in open-wheel racing. His
heroes are open-wheel racers, and he lives in Indianapolis,
open-wheel racing's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   But Leffler isn't one to wait around for the day that he will
land an open-wheel ride in an Indy car.
</P>
<P>
   Not when the lure of NASCAR is out there dangling future
employment to some of the sport's top young racers such as NASCAR
Winston Cup rookie Kenny Irwin Jr., a former open wheeler, and
budding star Tony Stewart, who's handed in his Indy Racing League
identification card for a shot at the stock-car circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a racer, and I've got to do what's best for myself,''
Leffler said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, what's best for Leffler is to try to secure a second
straight U.S. Auto Club national midget championship. Leffler, 23,
holds a narrow 10-point lead over Jay Drake with only three
remaining races, the first of those coming Nov. 21 in a scheduled
30-lap shootout on the half-mile dirt oval at Manzanita Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think winning last year's (midget) title and already winning
the USAC Silver Crown championship this season has helped open some
eyes,'' Leffler said. ``I think it helped me get an (Indy Racing
League) testing contract with (car owner Fred Treadway) and
Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those people liked my reputation. They knew I was
winning races and that I was possibly a good up-and-coming
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Treadway let Leffler use one of his cars so Leffler could take
the IRL rookie test in June at Texas Motor Speedway. Thanks in part
to Treadway driver Arie Luyendyk, Leffler had a job as the team's
test driver a month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I didn't feel like doing all the tire testing (for
Firestone) anymore,'' Luyendyk said. ``I really like (Leffler). I
think he's a good driver and he's done a good job for our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten a lot of miles (more than 2,000) in the car, and I
hope he gets a chance to drive in the IRL soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Treadway) finds a sponsor for a second car program, we'll
run the full season,'' Leffler said. ``If no sponsor can be found,
maybe we'll just do a few races, possibly the Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler is keeping other options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to run the IRL next season, and I'd like it to be
with (Treadway Racing),'' said Leffler, who moved two years ago
from Long Beach, Calif., where he grew up, to the Midwest and
temporarily rented a room from Stewart. ``That team has spoiled me
because it's so good. But if we can't get something accomplished,
I'll have to look somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a deal worked together to possibly do some (NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series) races next year as a second truck for a
really good team. I'm also looking toward stock-car racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still plan to do a full USAC Silver Crown schedule next
year, but I don't think we'll run for the midget title. I want to
concentrate on winning races and not worry about protecting a
points lead late in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler admits the IRL road may be filled with more potholes
than NASCAR avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be that many good teams out there,''
Leffler said. ``There's probably four or five of us (in the USAC)
that deserve a chance at the IRL, but I'm not sure about the IRL
direction. It was positive for awhile, but it seems like teams are
having a hard time finding sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these teams can't find any money to run, the opportunities
are not going to be there for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat of Glendale, a past USAC Western States midget
champion, believes Leffler would be a terrific IRL candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason was my teammate at the Chili Bowl (midget championship)
this year,'' said Boat, who now drives for IRL car owner A.J. Foyt.
``He's got a lot of talent, and I think he has a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven he can race. He's been fast in a midget car, a
champ dirt car and he's been some seat time in an IRL car. I would
expect to see him in some (IRL) races next year and he'll probably
be up front in no time at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn your back on what the IRL has done for some of
the younger guys,'' Leffler said. ``Look at Tony Stewart and Billy
Boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope something happens for me.'' &QL;

DRAG RACERS: SAFE AT ANY SPEED?  
 POINT LEADERS WANT TO GO FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks after leveling the field with an astonishing but
blurry 326.44 mph pass at Houston, Gary Scelzi still hasn't spotted
any National Hot Rod Association red flags.
</P>
<P>
   Good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (the NHRA) doesn't do anything about (slowing down the
cars),'' said Scelzi, who needs only to qualify for Sunday's
season-ending Winston Finals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway and he will
clinch a second successive Top Fuel Dragster title. ``When the cars
were running 320, the engines were throwing parts and blowing
tires, and Goodyear got a bad rap because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the cars can be going 200 and the same thing can happen.
Goodyear is on top of it and ahead of it. I'm sure they're up to
340 in their tests. I'm comfortable with'' the speeds.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the racers began reaching 320 mph, NHRA
officials started contemplating ways to curb escalating speeds. But
such testing was put on hold, and there are no signs of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes drivers such as Scelzi, Cory McClenathan and John
Force happy campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they leave (the speeds) alone,'' said Force, who
formerly held NHRA's fastest speed in a Funny Car. ``We're not like
NASCAR, where we're out there running around for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHRA is about making a car go quick and fast. That's what
(the fans) have been bred on, the great speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan also sees no reason to restrict speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're running the big speeds, the cars are still
safe,'' said McClenathan, who is on the verge of finishing
runner-up in the final standings for the fourth time in seven
seasons. ``I think that was (NHRA's) first and foremost worry. I
know it was ours, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the way things are going, they should leave us
alone for a while. I mean, if we saw some high speed crashes where
guys were getting hurt or killed, they might think about it. But I
think we're still one of the more safety-conscious sports around,
and so we should be able to go as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how fast McClenathan goes this weekend, it may not
matter.
</P>
<P>
   With Scelzi holding a substantial lead in the drivers standings,
McClenathan likely will have to wait for at least one more year
before attempting another run at the Top Fuel title.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these years, I'm going to have to win my first one,''
said McClenathan, who lives in Lake Havasu City. ``It's really a
tough bug to swallow. What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   How about a prayer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that,'' said McClenathan, who has finished
third in the final standings twice since 1992. He also finished
10th as a rookie in 1991 and was sixth in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can win this race, it still would mean a lot,''
McClenathan said. ``It would be my seventh win of the season and
that would be a record in the division.''
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan is one of eight drivers to win as many as six
national events in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Scelzi, who also has six wins this year, Don
Garlits, Eddie Hill, Kenny Bernstein, Joe Amato, Darrell Gwynn and
the late Gary Ormsby.
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan actually led for much of the season, taking over
March 22 and holding on until Sept. 20, when Scelzi moved ahead.
McClenathan won the following event at Topeka, Kan., to regain the
lead, but again lost it to Scelzi the following week at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi again won at Houston, dropping McClenathan 91 points
behind and with little hope of overcoming the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not second-guessing my year at all,'' McClenathan said.
``We had a great year. We showed again we had what it takes to be
there at the end. We just didn't go the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary got hot at the right time, and a lot of credit goes to
(crew chief Alan Johnson). Alan is just the best. He's done some
incredible things to (Scelzi's) car, and I'm one of the people he's
amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's still (today's) $100,000 Big Bud Shootout to look
forward to. If we could get some of that cash, it would ease the
blow (of again finishing second), and the off-season wouldn't feel
nearly as long.'' &QL;

INDY 500 NEEDS CART RACERS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk twice has sped to victories in the Indianapolis
500, once when it still was the greatest spectacle in racing and
again last year when it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   That's no knock against Luyendyk, who truly is one of the
sport's nice guys and top drivers. I'd put him up against most any
driver and still be counting my winnings afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But when Luyendyk beat runner-up Bobby Rahal, Emerson
Fittipaldi, Al Unser Jr. and Rick Mears across the finish line in
1990, it meant something.
</P>
<P>
   It meant Luyendyk had beaten most of the greatest racers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   When Luyendyk won in 1997, he also beat some quality drivers,
such as runner-up Scott Goodyear, Jeff Ward, Buddy Lazier and Tony
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the same. Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers
weren't there, thanks to Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony
George, whose decision three years ago to create the rival Indy
Racing League splintered the sport and transformed the Indy 500
into something far less important.
</P>
<P>
   But there yet may be hope for a reconciliation in time to
salvage Indy-car racing and the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, CART engine manufacturers
representing Ford Cosworth, Honda and Ilmor Mercedes-Benz have
agreed in principle on building normally aspirated motors that
could be used in both CART and IRL races.
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing can be done to bring CART and IRL teams
together for next year's Indy 500, there is speculation that an
agreement would pave the road for the sides to regroup at the 2000
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing is certain. The IRL still hasn't disclosed its
engine rule for 2000, which it expects to do prior to next
Saturday's awards banquet.
</P>
<P>
   But if rumors are true and the CART and IRL hierarchy are
contemplating common engine rules, Billy Boat of Glendale welcomes
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the betterment and growth of open-wheel racing, it's in
everybody's best interest to get the two sides together, because
the longer we remain divided, the more NASCAR grows,'' said Boat,
whose Indy-car break occurred because of the creation of the IRL.
``There's a lot of race fans out there, and we need to try and get
them. We need to start filling up these racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing the two sides together at Indy would be a big first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, who lives in Scottsdale, also welcomes a possible
renewal of old track battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I don't care who runs or comes over (from
CART),'' Luyendyk said. ``If all the CART teams decide to get IRL
equipment and come over, I think it would be great. I wouldn't have
a problem with that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really had a problem with whoever was competing. If
they can find a rules package that would satisfy both sides, you
could conceivably run for the IRL and CART championships and figure
out a way to bring together both to the (Indy 500).
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you have now is two series competing for the same
things, including the same sponsorship dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if common ground is reached, it's likely the IRL will
remain an all-oval series and CART will retain a mixture of oval,
road course and temporary street circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, making it possible for all open-wheel teams to meet at
Indy in May is nothing but good news for CART and IRL race fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard through the grapevine that people are talking about
making it possible for us and CART to meet at Indy, and that's a
good thing,'' Boat said. ``It gives the IRL guys a chance to
compete against everybody in CART, and it gives (fans) a chance to
see how talented we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a compromise is reached, Boat said, the sanctioning
bodies must also devise a chassis agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's differences,'' Boat said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least the two organizations appear to be striving
toward a mutual cause, which is to save the Indy 500 from wallowing
deeper into non-historical status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all this talk shows CART is interested in getting back
to Indianapolis,'' Boat said. ``They know they need it, and they
know their sponsors need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the biggest race in the world, and they know
that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Winter heat? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thank goodness for Tucson Raceway Park and the NASCAR Winter Heat
schedule. Gearheads have at least something to turn to in December
and January.
</P>
<P>
   The six-race season will begin Dec. 6 (the NASCAR Featherlite

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it ``No Exit,'' the Capitol's own
existentialist drama. The American public has signaled that it
wants the drive to impeach President Clinton to end. So do most
House Democrats. So do many Republicans. Yet the Republicans and
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have such a strange
synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other on and
on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Take the dispute over which witnesses should appear before the
committee as it examines Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and whether he lied about it in various legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was the Democrats who first said they were
interested in casting the spotlight on Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr to pose tough questions to perhaps the most unpopular man in
America on the conduct of his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, obliged _ with
a twist. Days after House Democrats made gains in mid-term
elections, he announced a scaled-back impeachment inquiry that
would feature Starr not simply as one of the major witnesses, but
as the only one. Republicans are hoping Starr's appearance Thursday
will backfire on the Democrats, with the prosecutor making a
compelling case against Clinton. Setting the stage last week, Starr
sent more evidence to the committee, this time concerning
allegations by Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on the committee are now protesting that it is
unfair to question only the prosecutor and bring forward no
witnesses who might rebut him. So some Republicans are now looking
to add other major witnesses like deputy White House counsel Bruce
Lindsey, a long-time confidant of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nov. 3 election, this kind of point-counterpoint had
some political utility. Republicans and Democrats alike were trying
to use the Clinton scandal to rev up their core voters and send
them to the polls. Now that the people have spoken, pragmatism
might dictate that the committee find a graceful exit from its
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But packed with hard-line conservatives and liberals, the
committee has always been one of the most ideologically divided in
the House. And the impeachment inquiry has only ratcheted up the
tensions and manuevering. ``There's very little middle in the
Judiciary Committee,'' sighed Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., a moderate
not on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   So Hyde and his Republicans seem grimly determined to push on
and charge Clinton with undermining the nation's legal system. And
the Democrats do not intend to help them.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said last week that even
though he wanted the inquiry brought to an end, that did not mean
he would not criticize it as slipshod and flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``you get accused of being complicit
with this whole thing and liking it and saying its fine and putting
on the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. I'm not going to do
that.''

<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald, the patron saint of rich, bored Jazz Age
cosmopolites, looked back wistfully to the years before World War
I, when, he said, Americans had not yet been ``corrupted by
advertising.'' One can only wonder what he would say now, when the
messages from Madison Avenue suddenly seem larded with cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor ads promote ``responsible drinking'' (a term that may
goad the irresponsible into ordering a double, straight up).
Cigarette makers print the Surgeon General's mandatory warning on
every pack, and offer, on company-run Web sites, advice on
quitting. Health clubs run ads warning customers not to let
diet-and-exercise regimes give way to anorexia or bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Are these ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course
not; ad agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of the
'90s. ``Consumers are cynical and literate,'' said Richard
Kirshenbaum, a New York advertising-agency executive who, with his
partner, Jonathan Bond, wrote a book titled ``Under the Radar:
Talking to Today's Cynical Consumer'' (Wiley, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, consumers would respond to the ad,''
Kirshenbaum added. ``Today, they're talking about the strategy
behind the ad. Everyone has a marketing degree and is a critical
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has certainly ratcheted up the cynicism, which
means that more ads than ever rely on irony and a particular kind
of edgy, self-deprecating humor. The struggling UPN television
network tried to promote its sitcom, ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' with the slogan, ``The critics hate it, you'll love
it.'' (The show has already been canceled.)
</P>
<P>
   Last season ABC introduced a high-concept ad campaign with the
smarty-pants slogan ``TV is good.'' This season the bright yellow
ads carry the slightly milder slogan, ``We love TV.'' But the
anti-authority tone is the same: ``If TV is bad for you,'' one ad
asks, ``how come every hospital room has one?''
</P>
<P>
   And Beck's beer is poking fun at its Teutonic origins. ``Germans
don't do laid back,'' the announcer says after a guy in a suit and
tie misses the point of a relaxation tape. ``They do beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum worries that all this tone is old news by now. He
says he first used it 10 years ago for Kenneth Cole, a New York
shoe designer. The ad said: ``Imelda Marcos bought 2,700 pairs of
shoes. She could have at least had the courtesy to buy a pair of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acknowledging that someone bought a huge amount of shoes, but
not yours, that's the core of how cynical people need or want to be
spoken to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a but, and it is nothing less than a nightmare for
Madison Avenue. ``Now that mainstream advertisers are adopting this
stance, consumers will tune this out,'' Kirshenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is scrambling to find new ways to get past them.
``One way of distinguishing yourself is to take a shot at
yourself,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of media studies at New
York University. ``In the process you're recognizing that people
are flooded with claims which are largely absurd or only
metaphorically interesting. By incorporating the skepticism into
your ad, you are inviting the consumer into a sort of collusion,
saying you and I both know that advertising is a crock, but we're
taking you seriously as one who's not a dummy. We're not dummies
either, we're all non-dummies together, and aren't we a swell bunch
of folks to hang out with?''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum makes much the same point _ in a strikingly
different way. ``Having an interesting and relevant corporate
posture is what's appealing to consumers today,'' he said, adding
that his agency now spends time working up corporate strategy.
``It's not just about an ad anymore. It's about the message behind
the company, the brand and the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media ecology at NYU, sees
this tack as the latest refinement of a time-honored public
relations technique. ``If they really cared, they wouldn't run
smoking ads in the first place,'' he said. ``They'd get out of that
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argues that cynicism allows companies to have it both
ways. ``The tobacco companies, for example, can do a certain amount
of repair work on their hideous image by seeming to offer
responsible advice about smoking,'' Miller said. ``The same is the
case with the liquor industry. But obviously, these new ads will
not do their old ads any harm. They're not ever as punchy as the
standard ads, nor could they be, because self-indulgence is always
more tempting than self-restraint.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper
attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General
Janet Reno announced last week that she was setting up a new
investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor was
the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include
a dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several
law-enforcement agencies. But the main work of looking into the
shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and
how it fits a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by
the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the FBI, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their
surveillance machinery on political groups, a number of senior FBI
agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general's
latest task force, the second she has ordered to begin a broad
investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive
the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates inquiries
into criminal activity from those into political causes and
unpopular ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves from the old
J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of political
dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They do not want
the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war
between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who
have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against
clinics and doctors. Many of those calling for government help were
once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, were
starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as
the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the
counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle,
wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups like
Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolence
Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill
doctors who perform abortions. They came up empty handed when Reno
ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a
Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted
a two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued some
anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. But investigators
never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem. The
FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of
politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of
anti-government militias, environmental and Christian extremists,
white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is very quick to jump from investigating crime to
investigating political association,'' said David Cole, a law
professor at Georgetown University. ``When you move from
investigating crimes to investigating groups, that all-important
nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus gets broader and
broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful political
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the World
Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995
and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased
efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies said they operate under domestic security
guidelines that require investigators to find a ``reasonable
indication'' that a group is planning to break the law before they
can open an inquiry into an organization. Before the authorities
can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches,
they must have specific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the
threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to
local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some
groups. Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little
real danger.
</P>
<P>
   Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed
by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group,
drifting along society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some
agents describe it, without the usual ties to family, friends or
work.
</P>
<P>
   The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for
bombings at the Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion
clinics. He has kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although
acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism
and hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a
material witness in the killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues
about his motives. He was an early follower of Randall Terry, a
leader of Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp was associated with the
Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   One law-enforcement official said that the government should do
what it does best. ``We should investigate violations,'' he said.
``We shouldn't investigate groups.''

PUBLIC HOUSING REFORM: MIXING UP THE PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review)

special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl

 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new law to revive the nation's troubled public housing had a
simple goal when it was first proposed several years go: Allow more
working poor families into projects that had become dominated _
some would say decimated _ by very poor welfare families.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale, first pushed by Republicans, was that working
families would be role models for their neighbors, would help
stabilize projects and, by paying higher rents, would help housing
authorities financially.
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the 300-page bill that President Clinton signed in
October is a provision that local officials warn could paralyze
that effort: It requires cities to mix working families with poorer
families in each and every project.
</P>
<P>
   Cities say this provision will be self-defeating because it will
mean having to persuade working families to move into the worst
projects, while trying to keep working families already living in
the better projects from fleeing when the poorest of the poor move
in.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted during last-minute congressional negotiations by Andrew
Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, the
provision has been hailed by the Clinton administration as a tool
to reach an even more important goal than income-mixing: racial
desegregation. That's because, generally, the poorest tenants tend
to be black and Hispanic; among the working poor, a greater
proportion are white.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said cities will have to find ways to make it work. ``They
will not get a penny from this department as long as they maintain
segregated housing,'' he said in an interview, referring to race.
Calling the law ``a revolutionary integration plan,'' he said it
would keep public housing from becoming even more of what it
already is: separate worlds, one for working families, another for
those on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing in almost every city, he said, is characterized
by far too many `` `white' buildings and `black' buildings and
`Latino' buildings and `welfare' buildings.'' Ideally, he said,
every building should reflect the racial makeup of each city's
public housing system.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's provision calls only for economic integration. But the
Clinton administration has portrayed it as being much more about
race. In September, Clinton urged a public housing law that would
``deconcentrate poverty, mix incomes and thereby mix people of all
races and ethnicities.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that racial imbalances remain widespread in
public housing and that years of official discrimination are
largely to blame. Cuomo complains that local housing officials
oppose his initiative because they do not want to desegregate. But
the local officials insist the law won't work.
</P>
<P>
   They say there's a big difference between rooting out
discrimination and trying to make people live where they don't want
to live in the name of racial balance. And, they warn that at its
worst, the law could turn public housing into a political
battleground, as mandatory busing once did for public education.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the last decade, even New York City, praised as having some
of the best public housing, has seen its proportion of working
tenants fall from half to less than a third, in part because of
federal rules favoring the poorest applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows cities to offer sweeteners to working
families _ like lower rents or moving costs _ to lure them to less
desirable buildings. But many city officials say that while they
favor economic integration and racial integration, too, it is
unrealistic to enforce the same numerical goals in every project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places that working families are just not going to
want to go,'' said a housing official in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smith, executive director of the Los Angeles Housing
Authority, said, ``I think given the traditional image of public
housing, it's going to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law says that 40 percent of newly vacant apartments must
go to the poorest, those making less than 30 percent of an area's
median income. (In New York, this means $15,000 for a family of
four. Familes making near that amount could be working minimum-wage
jobs, but those making much less tend to be on welfare.) The other
60 percent of vacancies can go to those making more _ people who
almost certainly have jobs. In New York, this could mean families
earning up to $40,000, in South Texas up to $25,000 and in Chicago
up to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ventrone, the staff director for the
Republican-controlled House subcommittee on housing, calls Cuomo's
provision ''an extraordinary example of HUD micromanagement which
is contrary to one of the main purposes of the bill'' _ to give
decision-making power to cities so they can find ways to attract
working families.
</P>
<P>
   Even some advocates for the poorest of the poor are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly necessary for someone to say it,'' said David
Bryce, deputy director of the National Housing Law Center, ``and it
would be nice if someone could do something about it, but the
reality is that it's incredibly complex. You've got to factor in
what people of color want for themselves. You can say segregation
is bad _ and forced segregation is certainly bad _ but you can't
leap from that to say that you must desegregrate all public housing
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But other housing advocates, including Jeff Lubell, an analyst
for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit
research group, say the law must find some way _ if not Cuomo's way
_ to address racial segregation or risk worsening the imbalance
when cities bring in working families, more of whom will be white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you achieve through the new targeting rules,'' Lubell
said, ``is lower-income familes in some of the higher-income
developments and other developments remaining largely very poor and
minority, then is that really a good policy?''

SPORTS COLUMN: ARMS AND THE MAN IN A CHANGED LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Catfish Hunter, it was always what he did with his arms and
hands. He gripped a baseball with his right hand and threw it with
his right arm. Threw it for 224 victories before he stopped
pitching at the relatively early age of 33, threw it for five World
Series championship teams, threw it for 328 innings in 1975 after
he joined the Yankees as a $3.35 million free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something got tight in my arm,'' he once said about pitching
all those innings, ``and I never got it right again until the
doctor manipulated it in 1978.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to his farm in Hertford, N.C., after the 1979
season, he depended on his arms and hands. He worked his peanut,
corn and soybean fields with his arms and hands, when he wasn't
hunting with a rifle in his arms and hands or fishing with a rod in
them. In 1987, he held his bronze Baseball Hall of Fame plaque with
his arms and hands.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's what he is unable to do with his arms and hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no strength in my arms and my hands,'' he said
recently in describing his ailment, now diagnosed as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. ``I can't do the
routine things like button a shirt anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   James Augustus ``Catfish'' Hunter wasn't complaining, just
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't changed. In 1977 he had a 9-9 record, but Billy
Martin, then the Yankee manager, started him in the second game of
the World Series. The Dodgers shelled him, but he never used his
damaged arm as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he wasn't right,'' Martin said later. ``I also knew he
wouldn't complain if he was hit hard. And by using him, it set up
our rotation for that Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's right arm had not been sound since that 1975 season
when he was 23-14 with 30 complete games. To appreciate those 30
complete games, consider that during the recent season the Atlanta
Braves' staff led the major leagues with only 24 complete games.
</P>
<P>
   All those complete games took their toll. Hunter skidded to
17-15 in 1976, dropped to 9-9 in 1977, then jumped to 12-6 in a
brief comeback in 1978 before concluding his career with a 2-9
record in 1979. But he never used his arm problems as a cop-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't alibi when you get hit,'' he once said. ``You're the
one who throws the ball. You can't blame anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers do. Some pitchers will say that the catcher called
for the pitch, that it was the catcher's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you're the one with the ball,'' Hunter said. ``You can
shake the catcher off if you think it's a bad call.''
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate how good Hunter was at his best, consider that he
was only the fourth pitcher in this century to win 200 games before
his 31st birthday; the others were the legendary triumvirate of Cy
Young, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And Hunter was only the third American League pitcher to win 20
games five consecutive seasons; the others were Johnson and Lefty
Grove. Of those five seasons, the first four were with the Oakland
A's that won the World Series in 1972, 1973 and 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started winning in Oakland,'' Reggie Jackson has said,
``Cat was the father of those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also was a father figure when the Yankees won the 1977
and 1978 Series. In his quiet humor, he could talk about Mr.
October in a way that the slugger's ego would accept. Such as on
opening day in 1978, when Jackson hit a homer and the Stadium fans
tossed hundreds of the new Reggie candy bars on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you unwrap one,'' Hunter said with a grin, ``it tells you
how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any other Yankee teammate, Lou Piniella enjoyed
jousting with Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Longball,'' Piniella once said, alluding to Hunter's
tendency to allow home runs, ``you've got me going back to the wall
so much, I'm going to have to put a mattress on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 150 hits,'' Hunter replied, ``and only 5 home
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Piniella said, ``is only because I can't hit against
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In their clubhouse camaraderie, Hunter laughed as hard as
anyone. ``Both of us can take it,'' he said. ``I can take the
joking and get on people. So can Lou, but some people can't take
it. They can give it, but they can't take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter could always take it, a strength that must be
serving him well now.

DUKE'S BIG MAN IS ALSO AN AGILE ONE

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Elton Brand laughs a lot. He smiles even more.
Not on the basketball court, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There, he grimaces and crumbles his face into a scowl, or
stretches it into encouraging barks at his Duke Blue Devil
teammates. Not 18 months out of Peekskill High School, the
6-foot-9-inch, 270-pounder has offered one surprise after another
in a start-and-stop college career that most believe will end after
this, his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up here on Tobacco Road with the kind of hulking frame
that looked destined to do hard, inside labor around the blocks in
the Atlantic Coast Conference. But Brand also demonstrated a flair
with the ball and feathery body control that make him a threat
anywhere on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When he broke his left foot late last December, his coach, Mike
Krzyzewski; his mother, Daisy, and some teammates circled his
hospital bed before surgery. They were devastated. Brand wasn't.
``It wasn't a career-ending injury or anything,'' he told them.
``There are so many more important things than a foot injury. I'll
work on my schoolbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came that he was probably out for the season.
Nearly 2 months, 15 games and a bionic-style rehabilitation later,
Brand scored 14 points and grabbed 7 rebounds against UCLA. He was
averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds and shooting 64.2 percent before
the injury. He finished the season at 13.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Brand is a front-runner for player of the
year honors and that Duke is the popular choice to win the national
title. But no matter what happens, Brand is sitting on another
stunner after the national title nets are cut down at St.
Petersburg's Tropicana Field next March.
</P>
<P>
   Will Brand be the first Blue Devil under Krzyzewski to leave
early for the National Basketball Association draft? Or will he
keep the coach's streak intact? He has heard the question all
summer, but can still beam ear to ear when asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so far-fetched to me sitting here right now to go to
the pros,'' he said. ``I missed so many games last year. I've got a
lot to prove. Heck, I'm unproven to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believe Brand showed how ready he was for the NBA over the
summer, when he led the United States to a surprising gold medal at
the Goodwill Games. He averaged 17 points and 7.6 rebounds against
older players, most of them professionals in the European leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a taste of how physical it is at that level,''
Brand said. ``Every possession is a war, and if they think they
found a weakness they keep going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Brand decides, Krzyzewski said his mere presence has
already transformed perhaps the most consistent basketball program
in the nation. Krzyzewski said he and Elton and Daisy Brand will
sit down and discuss the future after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has thought, however, about what he will demand from
Brand, or any other Blue Devil who leaves early. He will marshal
Duke's academic support staff and come up with a plan for the
player to finish his education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a commitment that they get a degree _ a Duke degree,''
Krzyzewski said. ``I'll make it clear if they don't that it will
affect my relationship with that player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Elton is the first one, then who better? He is mature. He
has respect for authority, great people skills and humility. I'd be
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the challenge will be quickly honing Brand and his
talented sophomore classmates _ guard William Avery, forward Shane
Battier and center Chris Burgess _ into a battle-tested Duke team.
Fortunately, the fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon remains to speed
up the process. Both the coach and his team captain acknowledge the
program is in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like there is becoming a younger NBA, we're getting
younger,'' Krzyzewski said. ``You need to do more coaching
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon concedes that the days of Duke underclassmen following
every command of the seniors are over. ``It's a different vibe
now,'' he said. ``When Cherokee Parks told me to do something, I
did it without question. I'm still the leader, but the younger guys
will tell me their opinion. It's not better or worse, just
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand is respectful of Duke's senior tradition, but counts
himself among the team's leaders. Last year, as a freshman, he
alternately encouraged and challenged the senior Roshown McLeod,
and it was part of what pushed McLeod to become a first-round draft
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a vocal guy; I can't help it,'' said Brand, unable to
suppress another laugh. ``But I also know that no one player can
carry a team. That isn't Duke basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next five months at least, that's all that matters to
him.

<P>
   In San Diego on Tuesday, two major drug companies rolled out
studies showing the safety and effectiveness of a new class of
prescription pain relievers; they had been duly tested on thousands
of patients, some for up to a year. Such testing was a minimum
requirement before the drugs could be prescribed to millions of
Americans. If the Food and Drug Administration approves, the drugs
can be sold.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the prestigious Journal of the American Medical
Association held a news conference in Washington to hail the
publication of six papers ``evaluating'' studies of alternative
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   These treatments were already on the market. The studies came
after the fact. The testing involved only dozens of patients and
only weeks of trials. Yet these studies, which any large drug
company would have considered tentative and inconclusive, were
presented as resolving questions of safety and efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial, titled ``Alternative Medicine Meets
Science,'' used decisive words like ``found,'' as in the study
``found'' that moxibustion _ the burning of herbs to stimulate
acupuncture points _ is helpful for breach pregnancy; that a
particular treatment ``is helpful'' for a medical condition; that
researchers were able to ``document'' that a mixture of Chinese
herbs ``improves symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a double standard? One thing is sure: the issue has
stirred up supporters and skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phil Fontanarosa, an editor of the Journal of the American
Medical Association who helped write its editorial, said that ``the
trials were all well done and the usual caveats were in place.''
The resulting news coverage was exuberant. But Fontanarosa said
that was the result of interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, said some critics of alternative medicine, who were
stung by what they saw as an exaggeration of the importance of such
modest studies.
</P>
<P>
   Double standard? ``Absolutely,'' said Dr. Richard Friedman,
director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Cornell Hospital-New
York Medical Center. With all the hoopla, the message that
alternative treatments were still a scientific terra incognita got
lost. ``The public will be sold'' on the notion that such
treatments have passed muster, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Hathcock, the director of nutritional and regulatory
science for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, argued that the
double standard works the other way by hurting the vitamin and
mineral industry. His group represents the dietary supplement
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hathcock said that an epidemiological study came out about a
month ago linking folic acid in the diet with protection from colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a high official at the National Cancer
Institute, and he said, `That's very intriguing, we're very
interested, but it needs to be confirmed with a clinical trial,'''
Hathcock said. ``I said, `Give me a break. There is no risk, and
the effective period is 15 years.''' A study is likely to take that
long to assess the effects of folic acid on colon cancer rates.
</P>
<P>
   If a treatment has a low risk, the consumer does not have be as
certain of the benefit in order to use it, said Dr. Stephen
DeFelice, chairman of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine in
Cranford, N.J. With actual pharmaceuticals, ``we require more
evidence because it is an unknown entity, an artificial molecule,''
he said. Drugs ``are not nature's way of handling disease,''
DeFelice added.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine is different, he said. ``These things are
not nearly as toxic as drugs,'' said DeFelice, adding that ``when
we go for benefits, we accept less evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that most Americans are indifferent about
evidence on whether alternative treatments work, said Lisa Meyer, a
spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition. ``People are
hungry for additional information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of America's acceptance of alternative medicine trace it
to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which
enabled makers of supplements containing herbs, amino acids,
botanical extracts, vitamins and minerals to sell them without the
approval of the FDA. These companies also can claim benefits for
their products _ without any supporting scientific studies. But
unlike manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and devices, they are not
required to report adverse effects to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   With no regulations forcing them to test for product safety, no
protocol for tracking bad side effects and no requirement that
products demonstrate effectiveness, the alternative medicine
industry has been able to sidestep the rules of drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Dr. Allen Roses, a vice president at the drug
company Glaxo Wellcome Inc., say that is inherently dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   If an alternative medicine company is selling its product as a
substitute for a drug, they should show that it works and that its
benefits outweigh its risks, said Roses, who questioned studies
like those in the medical journal. One of those studies involved
116 patients divided into three groups and studied for 14 weeks.
Such a study, he said, cannot detect deleterious side effects that,
as so often happens with drugs, occur only in a small percentage of
people or only after people take the drug for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to take anything, it should be based on
efficacy and not on hope,'' Roses said. ``You are crushing people's
hope by giving them a treatment that is not efficacious and
implying it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a clash of two cultures, said Dr. William
Wardell, the executive director of the Covance Institute for Drug
Development Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``The culture for
conventional medicine comes out of a history of fraud and
disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption is that drugs are ineffective and unsafe
unless they are proven to be effective and safe,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine's philosophy has been the presumption that
treatments are safe and effective unless proven otherwise. Now,
Wardell said, ``There is a confusion of gullibility with
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If sales go up from $2 million to $67 million, people say,
`This proves it works,''' he said. ``If you can put yourself in the
mind of a marketer, it's true. It works.''

BIG EAST CONFERENCE PREVIEW: CONNECTICUT HUSKIES ARE TOP DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RON DICKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reasoning goes like this: A team that finished with a record
of 32-5 last season and returns five starters should be great this
season. Maybe even a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Calhoun of CONNECTICUT does not argue with the logic,
but he will argue that his team is not great yet. Calhoun is hoping
that if the mind is conditioned for greatness, the body will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his 12 years at UConn, Calhoun has
enlisted a psychiatrist to counsel his players. He said the head
games he plays to make his charges work harder can only go so far.
A few of his players need to boost their self-esteem, he said, and
all of them could use help on focusing through the blur of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to understand the interdependence they have on
each other,'' Calhoun said after the Huskies' public scrimmage at
Hartford Civic Center last week. ``We do truly not just need our
talent. We really need to be tight together. That's what made us so
good last year.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 6,000 showed up at the Civic Center just to watch the
Huskies play each other. Calhoun feels the love of his loyal
following, but the flip side is never far away. UConn opens Sunday
against Quinnipiac at Storrs, Conn., and the state is restless.
Connecticut, the Big East's most prolific winner of the decade, has
made the final eight of the national tournament three times but has
never advanced to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said the Huskies got a bad break last season when they
faced North Carolina and lost, 75-64, in a home game for the Tar
Heels disguised as a regional final. The game was played in
Greensboro, N.C. This time, UConn, picked No. 1 in several
preseason rankings, is expected to create the bad breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really get down with people like that,'' said Richard
Hamilton, last year's Big East player of the year. ``I'll have to
go in another room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will most likely forgive Hamilton's aversion to
therapy, considering his scoring average of 21.5 points last
season. A 6-foot-6-inch swingman, Hamilton can hurt opponents with
a slash to the basket or a perimeter jump shot. A legitimate
concern is whether Hamilton can avoid hurting himself. A deep thigh
bruise hampered him his freshman season, and a broken right foot he
sustained during training for the world championships in July has
slowed his preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore point guard Khalid El-Amin (16 points and 4
assists a game), the Big East's rookie of the year, gives UConn
energy and nerve.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the exclamation marks end and the question marks
begin. The Huskies' other three starters _ forward Kevin Freeman
(10.3 points, 6.6 rebounds), guard Ricky Moore (7.5 points) and
center Jake Voskuhl (6.9 points, 7.1 rebounds) _ must expand their
supporting roles, Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   The swingman Rashamel Jones (4.4 points), the frontliner
Souleymane Wane (1.9 points), forward Edmund Saunders and guard
E.J. Harrison will vie for playing time in Calhoun's eight-man
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Can any team in the Big East stop the Huskies? ``I don't think
anybody is going to mail them the trophy,'' Georgetown Coach John
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, 26-9 and a round-of-16 qualifier last season, returns
forward Ryan Blackwell (12.6 points, 8.2 rebounds), guard Jason
Hart (10.2 points) and perhaps the Big East's best center, Etan
Thomas (11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds). Mike Jarvis, the new coach at
ST. JOHN'S, has the brashness of forward Ron Artest (11.6 points,
6.3 rebounds), the promise of the freshman point guard Erick
Barkley and a bevy of role players.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI, which squeezed into the 1998 national tournament with an
18-10 mark, will count on forward Tim James (16.8 points, 9.4
rebounds). PITTSBURGH is capable of breaking into the upper pack,
but its ironman guard, Vonteego Cummings (19.5 points, 40.1 minutes
a game), could use some comp time.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN has two capable guards in the newcomers Anthony Perry
and Kevin Braswell, but the Hoyas looked weak under the basket in
opening losses to Temple and Illinois. VILLANOVA, behind guard John
Celestand (13.2 points), could crack .500.
</P>
<P>
   RUTGERS will need more production from guard Geoff Billet (13.9
points, 4.1 assists) and forward Rob Hodgson (13.2 points, 5.4
rebounds) to offset a shortage of big people who can score and
muscle up. The swingman Jeff Greer (10 points) adds an athletic
touch.
</P>
<P>
   WEST VIRGINIA, 24-9 last season, could suffer the most drastic
fall in the conference, returning just the reserve forward Marcus
Goree (8 points, 5.2 rebounds). Count on the Mountaineers to press
and gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Amaker of SETON HALL has proved he can coach, squeezing 15
victories out of a marginal team last season. But can he recruit?
Point guard Shaheen Holloway (15 points, 6.5 assists) needs help
immediately. Guard Gary Saunders, a transfer from Georgia Tech,
should provide offensive punch. Duane Jordan (6.5 points, 6.7
points) is the best returning player from an uninspiring front
line. The Hall lost early to Indiana (understandable) and to
graduation-depleted Valparaiso (hmm).
</P>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE Coach Tim Welsh inherits his fellow New Yorker Jamel
Thomas (18.5 points, 6.9 rebounds) and not much else. At BOSTON
COLLEGE, the unexpected departure of forward Kostas Maglos to the
Greek professional league leaves the Eagles with one returning
part-time starter, guard Kenny Harley (4.5 points). NOTRE DAME no
longer has Pat Garrity; it has center Phil Hickey (10.7 points, 8
rebounds), a promising point guard in Martin Ingelsby (6.6 points,
5.6 assists) and a cold winter.

</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
backed down Saturday in the face of an imminent American attack and
said that his government would resume cooperating with
international arms inspectors. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-AIDS (Lusaka, Zambia) _ As the AIDS epidemic sweeps the
African continent, the underpinnings of many already shaky
economies are becoming riddled with cracks. As one economist put
it, the problems right now are merely insidious, ``but one day
you'll wake up and they'll be catastrophic.'' By Donald G. McNeil
Jr. (With photos, graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MASSACRE (Gornje Obrinje, Yugoslavia) _ Some of the
closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the
point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred near
this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children
and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian
forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor.
Piecing together what happened, a story emerges of fierce guerrilla
resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery and
infantry. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-APEC (Washington) _ Leaving much unfinished business,
President Clinton planned to fly late Saturday to a country he is
not eager to visit for an economic conference his aides expect will
produce few results. And the trip falls in the middle of Clinton's
preparations for a possible attack on Iraq. By James Bennet and
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-UNREST (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Faced with a huge
student protest and a wild outbreak of rioting and arson Saturday,
President B.J. Habibie said he would take ``firm action'' to curb
what he called subversive movements that threaten the country's
stability. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ECON (Beijing) _ China has entered a politically dangerous
era of slower growth and rising unemployment. The signs of trouble
are everywhere: it is hard to find a family in which at least
someone has not been laid off in the last year or two. By Erik
Eckholm. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-HUNGER (Tokyo) _ A congressman who visited remote parts
of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health
situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions
of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ANTISEMITES (Krasnodar, Russia) _ Here, along Russia's
southern border, where refugees from a crumbling empire have
settled in the ruins of the local economy, it does not take much to
disturb the festering sores of Russian nationalism. All it takes is
an enemy. For Nikolai Kondratenko, a Communist-Nationalist elected
governor of the Krasnodar region in 1996, that enemy is Zionism _
or rather what he calls ``zionacrats,'' using a new code word for
Jews in government, finance and the news media. By Celestine
Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   CLIMATE-CONFERENCE _ After an all-night session in Buenos Aires,
negotiators from more than 150 countries early Saturday set a
deadline of two years for adopting operational rules for cutting
emissions of waste industrial gases that are believed to cause
global warming. By William K. Stevens.
</P>

   FRANCE-JACKAL (Paris) _ The terrorist who calls himself Carlos
has been on a hunger strike for 11 days, protesting his four years
of solitary confinement in a French prison, where he is serving a
life sentence for murder. By Craig R. Whitney.

   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-AID-SCAMS _ As the cost of a college education rises,
and the cost of not having one soars in an increasingly competitive
society, scholarship brokers have proliferated, many on the
Internet. The Federal Trade Commission and other watchdog groups
say the sometimes desperate quest for scholarship money has
produced new victims for con artists. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CELL-ETHICS _ Saying that he is ``deeply troubled'' by the
creation of part-human, part-cow embryonic stem cells, which was
reported last week, President Clinton has directed the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission to consider the implications of the
research at its meeting next week and to report back to him ``as
soon as possible.'' By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   MD-CREMATION-ASH-FLAP (Pasadena, Md.) _ Residents of Venice on
the Bay, a neighborhood of about 175 people, have reason to believe
that outsiders have been sprinkling cremated human remains on their
small beach. By Michael Janofsky. (With photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   MASS-FOREIGN-POLICY (Boston) _ A federal district judge has
ruled that the Massachusetts Burma Law, which largely bars the
state government from doing business with companies that trade with
that country, infringed on the federal government's exclusive
control of American foreign policy. He is expected to issue an
order telling Massachusetts exactly what to do about the law this
week. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-WATCHDOG-RESIGNS (Los Angeles) _ The first person to serve
as a public watchdog over the Los Angeles Police Department
resigned from the position last week, criticized her bosses for
undercutting her authority and touched off concerns that the city's
commitment to overhauling the police was wavering.
</P>
<P>
   ABORT-DOC-PROFILE _ Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett A. Slepian

that would exhaust, even break, most people. A profile of the slain
doctor. By Susan Sachs.

scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, has apparently abandoned his
inquiry into the President's sex life, the portion of his
investigation that repulsed most Americans. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JONES-HISTORY (Washington) _ When the young woman stood
before the microphones here on Feb. 11, 1994, and accused Bill
Clinton of having made sexual advances on her, not much of the
world noticed or cared. Paula Jones said she was the Paula referred
to in an article in The American Spectator magazine which asserted

ONE EYE ON IRAQ, CLINTON TURNS THE OTHER TO THE PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaving much unfinished business, President Clinton
planned to fly late Saturday to a country he is not eager to visit
for an economic conference his aides expect will produce few
results.
</P>
<P>
   The annual summit meeting of nations touching the Pacific Ocean
was Clinton's own invention, a meeting meant to face the new
challenges of a global economic interdependence rather than the old
challenges of arms and dictators.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, it falls in the middle of Clinton's
preparations for a possible attack on Iraq, and in the middle of
what Clinton calls the ``biggest challenge to the global economy in
half a century.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is not complicated enough, the meeting convenes in
Malaysia, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has scorned
American prescriptions for recovery, closed off his economy and
jailed his Western-trained finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on what
the administration regards as trumped-up charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible that the Iraq crisis would force the president
to cancel or curtail the trip, which includes subsequent stops in
Japan, South Korea and Guam for meetings that are long on ceremony
and may prove short on substance.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's economic team said he had excellent reasons to go,
one of them a desire to encourage Asian countries to continue
opening their economies. The global crisis has fueled calls
throughout Asia to rethink just how open these countries want to
leave their borders to investments, which can flow out far faster
than they flowed in, leaving economic and political chaos in their
wake.
</P>
<P>
   While most nations in Asia have publicly repeated their
commitment to ever-freer markets, they are also watching Mahathir's
approach for signs of success.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has other business to conduct, including a meeting
Monday morning in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with President Jiang
Zemin of China, at a time of growing worry about China's economic
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern about Beijing's backsliding on human
rights. ``The early signs are in the wrong direction,'' Clinton's
trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said in a recent
interview, ``inconsistent with China's pronouncements of its
ostensible desire to move to an economy more open to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As in meetings in South Korea and Japan, Clinton also plans to
discuss the United States' growing concerns about North Korea,
which is resisting American demands to allow inspection of a vast
new site that the CIA believes could be a nuclear weapons plant in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Clinton is scheduled to hold a televised ``town hall''
meeting _ an American-style event that is likely to strike his
audience as unusual. This is part of an effort to reach around
government officials and spread his plea for economic
liberalization countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   From a political standpoint, the timing of Clinton's trip is not
bad at all, his aides acknowledged. On Friday, Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, sent more information about the president's
conduct to Congress, and Clinton agreed to pay Paula Corbin Jones
$850,000 to settle her 4-year-old sexual misconduct complaint
against him. Next Thursday, Starr is scheduled to testify before
the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, Clinton's aides said, will show him focused on his job
as Republicans in Congress once again focus on his scandals. And
while detailed trade discussions may not make for riveting
television, one senior administration official said, ``simply
seeing him on the job on this, even if people don't fully follow
all of it, is going to be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has made little effort to raise
expectations for what Clinton will accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the summit meeting will be how to deal with the
region's banks, which are drowning in hundreds of billions of
dollars in unrecoverable debts, much of it in real estate deals
that went sour when the Asian boom went bust. The United States has
been tinkering for weeks with plans based on the lessons learned
during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. But carrying out
the program will take money _ and Washington is not ready to
provide any. So it is broadly hinting that Japan should help pay
for the program, using $30 billion in aid to Southeast Asia that
Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically American,'' one Japanese diplomat complained
last week. ``Washington's ideas and our money.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not be the only conflict with Japan at the meeting.
The chief accomplishment sought by the United States is a
declaration that tariffs will be lowered in nine industrial sectors
that involve $1.5 billion in trade each year. But Japan has balked
at lowering tariffs for fish and wood products, both long protected
by Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. So far Japan has
refused to budge, leading Ms. Barshefsky to snap on Friday that
``token participation at the end of the day by the world's
second-largest economy doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks may erupt in the face-off between Clinton and
Mahathir, who has said that currency traders and American-style
capitalism are to blame for Asia's woes. The United States is
already struggling over how to deal with the jailing of Anwar, a
friend of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other administration
officials. Few doubt that Anwar was jailed for challenging
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's trial, on charges of corruption and illicit sex, has
been suspended for the duration of the conference. But last week
Anwar embarrassed Mahathir by forcing the government to reveal at
least one year-old police document suggesting that the sex charges
had been cooked up by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   To register his protest, the president will not meet one-on-one
with Mahathir. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also plans to
meet with Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife, despite official warnings
against ``interference,'' and Clinton seems likely to make sharp
remarks about human rights.

AS COLLEGE COSTS INCREASE, SCHOLARSHIP FRAUD FOLLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Fla., Pa., Md., Ky.)  (jw) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wesley Watkins IV, a 23-year-old Stanford University graduate
from Oakland, Calif., was accepted to a doctoral program in music
education in England. But, unable to afford the $17,000 annual fees
at Reading University, he searched the World Wide Web for
scholarship possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins chanced upon World Education Access, which vowed a
``scholarship for everyone.'' He ``joined'' the organization over
the summer for $1,289. In exchange, he was told, his tuition would
be covered. He flew to England last month. The money never came.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, while a few individuals have received
money from World Education Access, based in Dayton, Ohio, others _
or sometimes the colleges they had expected to attend _ received
invalid checks, or no checks at all.
</P>
<P>
   Among the institutional victims are St. Leo's College in
Florida; the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio; Franciscan
University of Steubenville, Ohio, and Geneva College in Beaver
Falls, Pa. Federal and Ohio state authorities are investigating,
but they declined to characterize the operation.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of a college education rises, and the cost of not
having one soars in an increasingly competitive society,
scholarship brokers have proliferated, many on the Internet. The
Federal Trade Commission and other watchdog groups say the
sometimes desperate quest for scholarship money has produced new
victims for con artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholarship scams are increasing,'' said Dana Lesemann, a
lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. ``We have recently filed
eight lawsuits against companies engaged in activities we consider
fraudulent. There were some 19,000 victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesemann said many were mail-based schemes involving the use
of picture postcards portraying smiling young graduates and a
promise that for a fee, often around $80, scholarships are
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the FTC shut down an operation in Maryland that
assured students that for a fee of $10 to $100, they would win
grants for $2,500 to $7,500. More than 50,000 people sent checks to
the organization, which used 10 different names. In most cases,
after the fee was paid, the organization was never heard from
again, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest schemes involve so-called personalized seminars for
students who meet counselors at airport hotels in exchange for
several hundred dollars,'' Ms. Lesemann said. ``The offer says the
counselor will find the appropriate financial aid program and fill
out all the forms for you. Some people are even giving out details
of their checking accounts for direct withdrawals, a good way to be
robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of a Web site, finaid.org,
estimates that there are 150 dishonest scholarship schemes a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total loss is something like $100 million a year,'' said
Kantrowitz, whose Web site offers a range of possible sources for
aid and alerts consumers to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes operate worldwide and sometimes include poor
countries, where an American or European college education is seen
as the best guarantor of long-term employment.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the United States, the search for scholarship money
has taken on something of a desperate nature as the federal
government has reduced its support and college costs have risen.
</P>
<P>
   John Joyce of the College Board said there had long been schemes
asking parents to pay for services they could have gotten free.
``Back in the 1970s when I started in this, there was a concern
over commercial scholarship search groups that would have parents
or students pay for services that gave them nothing more than they
could have gotten themselves,'' he said. ``After putting up the
money, the student would be told to apply for loans at banks or to
the federal government. What is happening on an increasing basis
today is that operations similar to that now exist on the World
Wide Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder and president of World Education Access, Simon
Kapenda, acknowledged in an interview having sent checks with
insufficient money in the account. He said he was in temporary
financial difficulty and would make up for failed promises when his
troubles cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda, 28, a Namibian immigrant, has made a special effort to
appeal to foreign students, many of them from Africa and other poor
areas, and many of them religious. He says he has done so because
of the scant opportunities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Muroki, a Kenyan national and Pentecostal missionary who
lives in Brackenridge, Pa., paid World Education Access $700 on
behalf of her church, Hope Ministry International, and was told by
Kapenda that he would pay for 10 students from Kenya, including her
daughter, Caroline, to attend Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The checks promised by Kapenda either failed to arrive or
bounced, Mrs. Muroki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking to myself, `What is he doing with the $700 I
sent?' '' Mrs. Muroki said. ``Why doesn't he return the money? He
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda's office telephone is often not answered. But, reached
by e-mail and then by telephone at his home, he vowed that he would
make good on his word. He said he was waiting for $300,000 of his
money to arrive from Angola, where, he said, it was being
improperly held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have enough money to cover it,'' he said. ``It was not my
intention for this to happen. I will try to fix whatever is messed
up. Maybe someone out there could send some money to the colleges
for these students.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda said that his money came from other ventures, which he
declined to specify, and that his only aim was to help those in
need.
</P>
<P>
   He has made good on a few promises, paying a handful of
students, like Gregory Head, who is studying at Brescia University
in Owensboro, Ky. Head said he had paid Kapenda $700 and had
received nearly $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   Head said he had been skeptical of World Education Access and
had tried to check it out. Like many of those interviewed for this
article, he said he had spoken directly with Kapenda, checked with
the Better Business Bureau, which had no record of complaints, and
after praying, decided to send in his money.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watkins, mother of Wesley, who flew to England expecting
his tuition to be paid, said she had spent a long time on the
telephone with Kapenda trying to understand how the scholarship
system worked. Even though she was suspicious, she decided her son
should give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so stupid now,'' she said. Her son has begun his
studies, and the family is looking for other sources of money.
</P>

   Kapenda said his new plan was for his Web site to investigate
and give a seal of approval to other Web sites, which would list
themselves with his site for a fee. He also hopes to become a
clearinghouse for educational assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of people out there with plenty of money who
don't know what to do with it,'' Kapenda said. ``I'm trying to make
a difference but it isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal authorities say they can not tell whether
Kapenda is dishonest or in over his head with a big, faulty idea.
</P>
<P>
   Without clear criminal intent, it can be hard for the
authorities to force the closure of Web sites, although Ms.
Lesemann, of the trade commission, said any promise not backed up
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kapenda changed his rules. No up-front fee from
applicants is required now and a promise of success is no longer
found on his Web site. But he said he had not given up on the
operation.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ What author Tom Wolfe did for radical chic in the
1960s, narcissism in the '70s, and greed in the '80s, he may now be
doing for runaway real-estate development in his new novel on
America at century's end. Urban sprawl, with all its strip-mall
excess and soul-deadening homogeneity, is not just a central
backdrop, but almost a character in ``A Man in Full,'' the author's
latest pen poke at contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you could tell you were leaving one community and
entering another was when the franchises started repeating and you
spotted another 7-Eleven, another Wendy's, another Costco, another
Home Depot,'' Wolfe writes. He was describing the San Francisco Bay
Area, but it could have been any metropolitan region in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, voters from Southern California to New Jersey
showed that the sprawl issue may have become a political driving
force no less than a narrative function in the fictional world of
Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Voters across the country and across party lines, from desert
suburbs in the West to leafy cul de sacs in the East, voted to stop
the march of new malls, homes and business parks at the borders of
their communities, and to tax themselves to buy open space as a
hedge against future development.
</P>
<P>
   For Vice President Al Gore, who has been ratcheting up the
sprawl issue as a top green concern, edging aside more contentious
and somewhat abstract environmental concepts like global warming,
the votes are seen as the start of a winning national campaign.
Who, after all, could be against what the Sierra Club now describes
as an attempt to return to Beaver Cleaver's America, albeit with
smaller lot sizes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to the conclusion that what we really are faced with
here is a systematic change from a pattern of uncontrolled sprawl
toward a brand new path that makes quality of life the goal of all
our urban, suburban and farmland policies,'' Gore said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman have
also listened to the same complaints around the barbecue. At the
very edge of what the author Joel Garreau famously labeled ``Edge
Cities,'' people say their new communities have become too
dependent on the automobile, too removed from nature, too close to
the clutter of boxy retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Paving paradise, almost a reflex reaction in Southern
California, was halted by a huge majority in Ventura County, where
voters approved a series of urban boundaries around the
fast-growing new cities wedged between Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara, and stripped their elected supervisors of the power to
approve new subdivisions and put it in the hands of voters instead.
</P>
<P>
   Developers now will have to get voter approval to push the flood
of tile-roofed subdivisions any further into land that has some of
the last big lemon groves in California. About 80 percent of the
county will be off-limits to developers, unless voters say
differently, supporters of the measure said. The Los Angeles Times
heralded the vote as a ``revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the most-densely populated state in the nation,
voters in 43 cities and six counties decided to raises their taxes
to buy and preserve open space. Statewide, by a two-to-one margin,
voters also approved spending nearly $1 billion over 10 years to
buy half of the Garden State's remaining garden space.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, voters approved nearly 200 state and local ballot
initiatives on curbing sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Al Gore talking growth management for the next two
years and beyond may be no more appealing than hearing another flat
tax speech from Steve Forbes. The vice president has been pounding
the anti-sprawl bully pulpit for months, proclaiming the dawn of
``an American movement to build more liveable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is seen by his supporters as a key to all those Jeep
Cherokee driving suburbanites with few political passions beyond
the afternoon traffic jam. The elections earlier this month, based
largely on grass-roots initiatives, have only bolstered Gore's
case, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   But before Gore tries to lay a Democratic claim to an issue that
cuts beyond most political lines, he will have to go through the
Republican governor of New Jersey. Just five years ago, Whitman was
held up by her party as a young Margaret Thatcher, with tax cuts as
her banner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year into a second term, Whitman has made protecting open
space the primary issue _ and perhaps her legacy _ for the state.
In what may be an act of heresy to the tax-cutting wing of her
party, the governor has been campaigning for tax increases to keep
land out of the hands of developers. Initially, she proposed an
increase in the gas tax, but has settled on the kind of selective
property tax increases that were approved across New Jersey on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to understand that once land is gone, it's gone
forever,'' said Whitman while pushing the new open space measures.
She could have been just another doorbeller from the Sierra Club,
which, in response to a survey of members, has put sprawl at the
top of its list of environmental concerns. The club says 400,000
acres of open space are lost to development every year.
</P>
<P>
   The successful anti-sprawl campaigns steered away from talk of
government control or zoning arcana. They dwelled instead on images
of lemon groves and tawny hills in Southern California, pumpkin
patches and horse farms in New Jersey, and wind-whipped dunes in
Cape Cod _ all just beyond the exurban fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to subvert the American dream _ we're trying
to get back to it,'' said Larry Bohlen, co-chairman of the Sierra
Club's national campaign to fight sprawl. ``It's that `Leave it to
Beaver' town where all the kids walk to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of these measures, led in California by home builders
and developers, say the new political calculation could change in
the blink of an eye if the economy turns bad. In bad times, people
are less likely to vote to restrict growth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in Oregon, which pioneered boundaries around all its major
cities in the 1970s, voters have upheld the state's far-reaching
anti-sprawl laws even during the depths of two recessions over the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say the votes this month were not so much an
anti-growth chorus as they were a reflection of the frustration
people feel over traffic and crowded schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opponents say they are stunned by how quickly
suburban growth has become a pejorative. ``We seem to be at a point
now where the word sprawl has been totally demonized,'' said
Clayton Traylor, vice president for political issues for the
National Association of Home Builders, which has 195,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians may find it difficult to nationalize what
is basically a local issue. Gore has raised the possibility of
using the Federal tax code or major transportation bills to
discourage growth that goes against community planning goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we adopted national policies that spend lots of
taxpayer money to subsidize out-of-control sprawl,'' Gore said.
``They suck the life out of urban areas, increase congestion in the
suburbs and raise taxes on farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is vague on what, precisely, could be done on a national
level. But whatever he attempts to do will be met by stiff
opposition if it ends up slowing development, Traylor said.
Building lobbies for highways and some conservatives were outraged
that the $217 billion transportation bill that was just approved by
Congress contained a small amount of money for bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the vice president or anyone else at the
federal level tries to turn off the spigot for new infrastructure,
we'll be there to fight them,'' Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, however, turning off the spigot proved to be a
winning political cry, as supporters of new developments were
hastily dispatched on election day. A Republican who favored two
huge projects in Anne Arundel County, County Executive John Gary,
was voted out office, while Republicans who vowed to pull the plug
on new water and sewage systems in neighboring Calvert County took
control of the Board of Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, developers have tried to co-opt the anti-sprawl
movement. Arizona voters narrowly approved a measure, sponsored by
the state's banking and building industry, that would set aside $20
million a year for 11 years to buy open space. But in return, the
law would ban development fees and urban growth restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The homebuilders were heartened by at least one of the sprawl
votes that went the other way. In Georgia, voters turned down a
measure to use a real estate transfer tax to preserve historical
sites and open space. Georgia is the main setting for Wolfe's
novel, a place where a huge, troubled development at the far edge
of suburban Atlanta is at the core of one man's decline.

   Israel Ratifies The Peace Accord
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet, after a two-week delay, ratified the Wye
peace memorandum almost begrudgingly and with a string of riders
attached.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, just a day later, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu opened bidding for a large housing development in the
predominantly Arab east side of Jerusalem. The move was seen as a
gesture to the disaffected right and was denounced by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had been unable to get a solid majority of his
ministers to back the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To the Israeli public, it looked like an inauspicious start to
what will inevitably be a difficult implementation process.

   Big Push to Curb A Blinding Disease

   The eye infection trachoma dims the vision of 6 million people,
making it the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the World Health Organization announced a new
strategy for eventually eliminating blinding trachoma that calls
for supplying clean water to improve personal hygiene, minor eye
surgery to help repair scarring and once-a-year use of an
antibiotic, azithromycin.

   Simpson Loses Appeal
</P>
<P>
   Should a man acquitted of killing his wife get custody of the
children? There seems no reason why he shouldn't. But here's a
thornier question: What if the man is O.J. Simpson?
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, he was indeed given custody of his children,
now 10 and 13, and both have since written the court asking to stay
with their father. But an appeals court reversed that ruling,
saying that ``common sense'' dictates that the murder ``is about as
relevant as it is possible to imagine.''

   Simpson vowed to fight the decision.

   Jones Case Is Settled
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton agreed to pay Paula Corbin Jones $850,000 to
drop her legal claim that he crudely propositioned her seven years
ago. The payment settles a lawsuit that Clinton's advisers had once
mocked but that, by forcing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
into public view, had begun to threaten his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Msr. Jones dropped what she had called her most important
demand: that Clinton apologize and admit wrongdoing. The president
continued to call Mrs. Jones' accusation baseless.

   Human, Cow Cells Mixed
</P>
<P>
   A small biotechnology company announced that it had fused human
cells with cow eggs, forcing the cells to revert to the primordial,
embryonic state from which all other cells develop.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Mass., said
the method could eventually be used to grow replacement body
tissues of any kind from a patient's own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic cells consisted of a human cell's nucleus in a cow
egg whose nucleus had been removed. The company said the hybrid
cells quickly became more humanlike, as the human nucleus took
control and displaced cow proteins with human proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Court Sidesteps School Voucher Debate
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to get involved in the national
debate over whether it is constitutional to use taxpayer-financed
vouchers to send children to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   With only Associate Justice Stephen Breyer dissenting, the court
let stand a ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that held that a
program in Milwaukee in which poor students are given vouchers that
may be used at religious schools did not violate either the state
or federal constitutions. For the time being, that is the most
definitive court ruling in the nation on the voucher issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to avoid involvement means that there is
still no national constitutional standard to judge voucher
programs.

   Questions About the Promise Of a Cancer Cure
</P>

   Officials at the National Cancer Institute said they have been
unable to reproduce the striking discoveries described a year ago
by Dr. Judah Folkman, the Harvard researcher who reported that he
and his colleagues had wiped out malignant tumors in mice with
compounds that destroyed the tumors' blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman issued a statement saying that it was too soon for the
institute's scientists, who began their studies within the past
year, to have mastered techniques that took his team years to
develop.

<P>
   America Reduces Its Thirst
</P>
<P>
   Water use has grown in lockstep with America's population and
economy, and many have thought it would always be that way. But
according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the nation used 9 percent
less water in 1995 than in 1980, while the population grew by 16
percent. The reversal may reflect a shift in focus away from
finding ways to expand the water supply and toward reducing demand.

   Where Walter Mitty Works Out
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, where Main Street is Broadway and people get bored
in a New York minute, acting out is the most popular new way to
work out.
</P>
<P>
   Former dancers from the New York City Ballet lead classes that
let people make like ballerinas as they work to get back into their
favorite blue jeans. Retired professional football players lead
workouts where people learn to pass and dodge tackles like the
pros. Some people are enlisting in boot camps led by former
military officers. And in a class called ``Abs, Thighs and
Gossip,'' the instructor teaches in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners hope the new trend in workouts _ sweaty, high-energy
theater, with props, live music and instructors who live what they
teach _ will make exercise fun and attract new members. In the New
York area, 11.2 percent of the population belong to health clubs, 2
percent more than six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter workout, based on real fire fighting techniques,
is almost always packed. In a workout room at Crunch in Midtown
Manhattan one recent evening, a voice from a staticky radio called
for units to respond. Sirens wailed, lights flashed and Eric Torres
_ a beefy firefighter in 50 pounds of fire gear _ ordered his
battalion to prepare for battle. ``You're about to fight your first
fire, rookies,'' he said. ``Get ready to hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The students scale the equivalent of 80 flights of stairs as
fast as they can using a bench. They tear down imaginary walls with
weight bars, dodge imaginary backdrafts by falling to the floor and
crawling on their elbows and knees, and take turns dragging a
125-pound victim, a crash-test dummy, to safety.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the hour, the participants have worked off between
600 and 800 calories. Drenched in sweat, they are gasping so hard
that many drop to their knees. But when they recover, they swear
they feel great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' said Chad Klopotek, 24. ``This workout
really kicks your butt.''

<P>
   One of the reasons that movie studios make so many action
pictures is that they do well overseas. There are no translation
problems when Bruce Willis is firing an Uzi or fleeing a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies and dramas are a different story. Comedy, in
particular, frequently hangs on the thinnest of cultural threads.
But when a comic film takes off, the distributors will do
everything possible to push it overseas. Take, for instance,
``There's Something About Mary,'' one of the biggest and silliest
movies of the year, starring Cameron Diaz. To foreign audiences,
the title was mystifying. So 20th Century Fox renamed the movie
country by country.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, blonde jokes are popular, so the title became, ``For
the Love of a Blonde.'' In France, it was, ``Mary at All Costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Neeson, the executive in charge of foreign distribution at
Fox, said Asians prefer literal titles. So in Thailand it became,
``My True Love Will Stand All Outrageous Events.'' In Hong Kong it
was called, ``Enjoy Yourself in the Game of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   That's poetic by the standards of Hong Kong, where the demand
for literal descriptions has produced some jarring results. The
Cantonese title for ``Leaving Las Vegas'' translates to ``I'm Drunk
and You're a Prostitute.'' ``Field of Dreams'' was ``Imaginary Dead
Baseball Players Live in My Cornfield.'' For truth in advertising,
you could not beat the title for ``The Crying Game'' _ ``Oh No! My
Girlfriend Has a Penis!''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Chinese seem to find unintended meanings in
American movies. ``Interview With the Vampire,'' for instance,
became, ``So, You Are a Lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no arguing with the Chinese take on ``Babe'': ``The
Happy Dumpling-To-Be Who Talks and Solves Agricultural Problems.''
Or ``My Best Friend's Wedding'': ``Help! My Pretend Boyfriend Is
Gay.'' Or ``George of the Jungle'': ``Big Dumb Monkey Man Keeps
Whacking Tree With Genitals.'' Or even ``Batman and Robin'': ``Come
to My Cave and Wear this Rubber Codpiece, Cute Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, there is that poetic side, as with the Pamela
Anderson Lee vehicle called ``Barb Wire.'' The Chinese saw it as
``Delicate Orbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your Head Can Hurt You.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zorba the Greek taught a young man to dance. Red the
Coach taught New York fans to chant ``Dee-fense! Dee-fense!''
</P>
<P>
   He was the golden age of New York professional basketball,
wrapped into one self-contained package. He won the only two
championships the Knicks have won in their half century, and he did
it without arrogance or self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He never needed the extra buzz. He waited to light his victory
cigar in private, when he got home to Long Island and had dinner
with Selma. He coached two terms for the Knicks, and then he
retired to his seat a few rows above the court, far from the Knick
bench, blending in, an older New York guy with white hair now.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day when his ailing wife stopped coming to the
games with him a few years back, and last summer Selma died. There
is no professional basketball this fall, and Red Holzman did not
have time to wait. He died Friday night of leukemia at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman did not look good two weeks ago at a friend's wedding.
Somebody said it was good that Red was getting out again, despite
his mourning of Selma, but he was not looking well, and he was sad.
</P>
<P>
   His old boys named Reed and DeBusschere and Monroe stopped to
greet him, honoring the man who had pulled them together, taught
them to dance as a unit, with their hands up and their elbows out.
</P>
<P>
   His old boys respected him. The hardest thing in the rivalry
between the Chicago Bulls and the Knicks was that Phil Jackson
could not often speak of what Holzman had taught him in those
sessions 30 years ago, and Holzman could not openly chortle about
the gangly kid who had obviously been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The tributes from basketball people will address his coaching
genius, but I can remember an autumn when he seemed like just
another assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman did not want the top job. That was the impression he
gave in the fall of 1967. The Knicks were at some obscure training
camp, and Red seemed quite content to be an assistant to Dick
McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman did not give off any burning lust to be a head coach
again. Years later, when Rick Pitino and Mike Fratello were working
for the Knicks, they would have this burning lust to them that
said, it's either going to be here or somewhere, but it's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But Red Holzman, this 47-year-old man with traces of red in his
hair, sat around and schmoozed, a No. 2 guy if ever there was one.
He had been a head coach once, in Milwaukee and St. Louis, and he
did not need it. Between the humble McGuire and the low-key
Holzman, there was a decided absence of ego, just two basketball
lifers starting another season.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptive. Red Holzman was deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks faltered early in the season, and the saintly
McGuire had to go, Holzman was summoned into the musty front
offices at Madison Square Garden and forced to take the position.
</P>
<P>
   He did not want to undermine McGuire, and beyond that, he did
not want to disrupt his routine, going home at night and having
dinner with Selma. Every clipping about Red for the next 30 years
would talk about Selma, and the steak, and the Scotch, his stable
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But something did change. When he took over the Knicks, he
immediately installed a more aggressive defense that must have come
from somewhere. Had the sly old dog been plotting defenses while
hanging around the gym? He also showed a quiet passion that he had
never allowed to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, fellow coaches noticed that life had just become
tougher. Alex Hannum, another winning coach, said: ``Red has pure
dedication, Holzman dedication. I was enthralled watching him and
hearing him over the crowd noise from the other end of the court,
screaming instructions to his team while he was on his knees.
That's dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   The dedication helped win two titles, but Holzman never took on
airs, and he never showed fear. He was once asked by Paul Horowitz
of The Newark News, now defunct, why he did not seem worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul,'' Holzman said, ``you should have known my father. He
was a great man. He said a lot of great things. He used to say: `If
I'm alive, we'll go Saturday. If not, we'll go Sunday.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He never seemed to take himself seriously, but the players and
the fans learned to do that.

METS TRY TO RISE ABOVE THE TAINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The vultures wasted no time. ``A couple guys said, if you do
start to look, they have interest,'' Frank Cashen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all decent people,'' Cashen, the Mets' interim
general manager, quickly added. But only vultures and opportunists
would get in line for the Mets' general manager's job while the
general manager is on a secluded leave of absence and the Mets are
still reeling from the disclosure of his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who wasn't blindsided,'' Fred Wilpon
said. ``But we have to go on from here. I'm not one to stay in that
kind of state.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wilpon and his co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, were the kind of
people who couldn't rebound from adverse developments, they would
have plunged into a catatonic state long ago. The Mets, in the past
decade or so, have encountered enough nasty incidents to wipe out
less resilient people.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, during the reign of George 3d, have long produced
their own sort of soap opera, but the general theme has been more
owner-generated: George vs. Billy, George vs. Reggie, George and
Howie vs. Dave _ that kind of running warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have created their own problems, too, but they are far
more serious than someone saying, ``The two of them deserve each
other; one's a born liar, the other's convicted.'' Firecrackers,
drugs, alcohol, child abuse and rape have been the themes of the
Mets' problems.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Mets keep trying to erase and rise above
the taint, to fix the image, but like an overmatched boxer, as soon
as they get up, they get knocked down again.
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be a wonderfully positive off season for the
Mets. They had a good season, even if it had a disappointing
climax, and they challenged the Yankees for attention early in the
off season by re-signing Mike Piazza and Al Leiter. More signings
and trades were to come in the club's plans to take the extra step
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the shocking, though reluctant, revelations of Steve
Phillips. Granted, the effect of his confessions of extramarital
affairs, in real life, is more painful for his family and for his
career, but the Mets obviously suffer from the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what I have heard from the fans in terms of people I
see,'' Wilpon said, ``recognizing they might not tell me what they
would tell you, what I hear on radio, read in newspapers, see on
television, it's a very tragic story, but I don't think it's such a
cloud in the sense that people aren't interested in talking about
the baseball now.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Bobby Bonilla's return, the owner said, is good
for the Mets. Until Bonilla shows up in the lineup every day, no
one will know whether he will produce, but last week's trade has
fans chattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict what's going to happen,'' said Wilpon, a
Bonilla believer. ``He's a different guy. He has the strongest
desire I've ever heard about not ending his career without making
it in New York. That's motivation. I have high regard for what he
has left. I think he will be an important addition to this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon, who has seen major off-season moves backfire before,
acknowledged that bringing Bonilla back is a calculated risk, but
he believes Bonilla has another motivating factor working in his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one wonderful, smart and strong-willed wife,'' Wilpon
said of Millie Bonilla. ``She loves Greenwich, where they live.
She's ecstatic. She wants to be here. They want to be here. It
makes a difference. He's going to live in Greenwich when he's
through playing. So he has a lot of motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever else joins Bonilla on next season's team _ B.J. Surhoff,
Brian Jordan, Robin Ventura, Eric Young, Darren Dreifort, Armando
Benitez, Arthur Rhodes _ the Mets should be part of the wild-card
race. More they cannot expect. They still play in the same division
as the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my guess,'' Wilpon said, ``we're going to be able to
improve our relief pitching and power. I don't know if we'll be
able to improve our speed by having a leadoff hitter, although it's
a possibility. I think we'd have a shot at improving our starting
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon, however, chose not to express his thought on the future
of Phillips and the team's general manager job. ``I really don't
want to get into that now,'' he said, ``for legal reasons and for
people's emotional reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball lawyer lamented Phillips' plight. Firmly believing
that Phillips will not return from his leave of absence to be
general manager of the Mets again, he said: ``It's a shame. If they
banished every baseball person who messed around, you couldn't put
together a league, let alone two.''

DID SEHORN INJURY SIGNAL IMPENDING DOOM FOR THE GIANTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days Jason Sehorn spends more time inside Giants Stadium
than he ever did. But it is nothing like the time he used to spend
there.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his daily rehabilitation on his injured right knee,
Sehorn enters the empty stadium just past 11 a.m. and walks up
every stair in every aisle in the lower and upper tiers. That is 76
aisles and more than 3,000 stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be full of people cheering our team; now it's just
me,'' Sehorn said Friday morning as he sat in the training room off
the players' locker room. ``I do everything alone. I'm my own team.
There's no one to help you walk up and down stairs for an hour
anyway. I'd rather be in solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   To fans of the beleaguered Giants, Sehorn's knee injury is
easily the most noteworthy event in what has been a most
forgettable season. To many, the team's descent this year can be
traced to the moment when Sehorn landed awkwardly on the warm
evening of Aug. 20, his knee bending unnaturally beneath him on the
opening kickoff of an exhibition game with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, an emerging star who was due to begin his third season
as the team's best cornerback, tore his anterior cruciate and
medial collateral ligaments. A young, brash Giants defense _
epitomized by Sehorn, whose bounty of talent graced and dominated
games last year _ felt its vulnerability that instant.
</P>
<P>
   Although Conrad Hamilton has taken his place and played well,
the Giants miss Sehorn, a smooth and elegant player gifted with
speed and size who gave a hawkish defense the confidence to attack
virtually free of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, 27, who had surgery two months ago, spends three hours a
day, five days a week rehabilitating his knee at the stadium. He
purposely arranges his workouts around the Giants' practice
schedule, arriving before his teammates do, staying out of their
way and leaving before they come back from practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that much fun to be around 53 healthy guys who are
running around and talking about football when you can't do it,''
Sehorn said. ``And it avoids the redundant questions and answers.
People feel obliged to ask you how you're doing. What can you say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing good. There are no tears running down my face.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury never did dramatically unsettle Sehorn. When he came
to the sideline after being tackled on the opening kickoff Aug. 20,
he initially avoided the team's doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coach Fassel kind of looked at me, and I looked at him
like, `This might be my worst nightmare,''' Sehorn said. ``The
doctor came over and grabbed my knee and twisted it one way. He
looked me right in the eye and said, `They got your ACL.' Then he
turned it the other way. He said, `They got your MCL.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just as matter-of-fact as that. I said, `Are you sure?'
He said, `This knee is swinging like a barn door.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the locker room, the Giants allowed Sehorn's wife
of six months, Whitney, to go inside. She wanted to cry. Jason
would not let her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the worst thing that could happen by a long
shot,'' he told her. ``Don't worry about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside his townhouse in Teaneck, N.J., Sehorn has a picture of
the tackle that tore apart his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see my lower leg flat on the ground sideways and my
thigh perpendicular to it,'' said Sehorn, who has a scar about five
inches long on his right knee. ``I put it up where I can see it
every day to remind myself that this is what happened and this is
what we have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days he rides a stationary bicycle, lifts weights with his
legs and upper body, does 300 sit-ups and a series of flexibility
exercises and then hits the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   When he began his rehabilitation, Sehorn, whose all-round
athleticism won him the annual Superstars competition last spring,
was shocked how much strength he had lost in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a 20-pound plate on the weight machine for my leg,''
Sehorn said. ``That thing looked as thin as a potato chip. And I
had to strain to lift it. I was saying, `Are you kidding me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the mechanic who loaned somebody a brand new car
and they brought it back with all these problems. What happened to
my knee? It was brand new the last time I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn used to lift 200 to 220 pounds per leg. Now he is up to
80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush,'' he said. ``My next season doesn't begin
until July.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn will be on the sideline for Sunday's game against the
Green Bay Packers, as he has been for all of the Giants' home
games. He finds watching football boring and watching the Giants
lose agonizing. He wonders, like most fans of the team, how they
have fallen so fast from division winners to a 3-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of opinions about it,'' he said when asked
what was wrong with the Giants. ``But my mother told me to keep
some opinions to myself. I'm not in the meetings. I don't know the
game plan. I did go to the Washington game, and they just looked
lifeless. The defense had no giddy-up when they came off the field.
Then at Dallas last week, it looked like a completely different
team and played with lots of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the injuries have hurt the cohesiveness we felt
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And if one injury _ his _ stands out among all the rest, Sehorn
is not sure it was the catalyst for all the other woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we'd be 6-3 if I played,'' he said. ``How
could anybody say something like that?''
</P>
<P>
   He has no regrets about choosing to return that one kickoff
nearly three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah, I regret not going to the right instead of left,''
he said with an easy smile. ``But I wanted to do it, and I had no
fears. Now there's no chance I'll get back there catching a kickoff
again. It took a year away from my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is plenty busy for someone who claims to
have too much time to kill. Besides his workouts, Sehorn writes an
online football column, does some television commentary and heads
to the mega-plex for the afternoon movie matinee a couple of times
a week. And he tries to avoid the temptation of the catalogs piling
up on the coffee table in front of his couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that every mail-order catalog maker in America
knows I'm injured and just sitting around,'' he said. ``I don't
know how they found out, but my mailbox is filled with catalogs
every day. They know I'm not playing this year. The whole world
knows I'm injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' world will be happier when Sehorn no longer has time
for home shopping.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It was not supposed to turn out this way. Tough
sanctions linked to aggressive arms inspections were intended to
keep Saddam Hussein boxed in, not to drive the United States into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   But time and again Washington has had to turn to military action
or the threat of war to beat down a challenge from the Iraqi
leader, whose continued intention is to possess an armory of the
world's most lethal weapons. When the confrontation ends, Iraq goes
back into the box, but it is a container that gets flimsier with
each showdown.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, it has been evident to governments in
every region of the world that the Clinton administration's policy
of sanctions forever has run its course. Saddam won power by terror
and depleted Iraq's resources in war and ostentation even before he
unwisely strayed into Kuwait in 1990, and if he ever intended to
cooperate with arms inspections, he very clearly decided within the
last year that he had played the game long enough.
</P>
<P>
   For months, foreign and domestic critics of the U.S. policy on
Iraq have urged the administration to show some creativity or
flexibility _ or even naked muscle _ to steer away from a dead end.
At one extreme are those who think the time is overdue to remove
the president of Iraq by marching on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   At the other are those like France, Russia, some large
developing countries and most Arab nations who say they no longer
see a direct military threat. They essentially urge United States
to let Saddam sell oil while policing Iraq from afar, but they are
also willing to stand back and let America bomb. In between, other
ideas lie in wait.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has found one option particularly appealing:
sporadic bombing aimed at knocking out specific sites or generally
intimidating Saddam, but not removing him from power. The problem
would be Saddam's survival, which would guarantee continued trouble
and, if many ordinary Iraqis were killed, a loss of support around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale attack on Iraq and, perhaps, an occupation of
Baghdad is a course that the Bush administration ruled out in 1991
and the Clinton administration is not likely to choose. It has a
growing number of supporters on the conservative side of politics
in the United States, but virtually no backers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq was greatly weakened by the Persian Gulf war, but Saddam
still has the power to force every Iraqi adult into military
service and he has been allowed to keep a formidable defensive
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Muravchik, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute
in Washington, said that even leaving aside the material and
political costs of assembling a huge army and persuading the public
to accept casualties, U.S. leaders have apparently concluded that
there is little point in ousting Saddam; the rationale is that
responsible, democratic government doesn't seem to work in the
region. But Muravchik, the author of ``Exporting Democracy,''
argues that's no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons learned in the 1930s about aggressors led us to
get rid of them,'' he said. ``We occupied Germany and Japan to
insure that there would be more benign governments. That clearly
was what would have been necessary in Iraq, but we didn't have the
courage to do it.'' Now, he said, it is up to dissidents to
overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats respond that a U.S.occupation of Iraq _ in the
heart of a region that still harbors resentment of the British
occupation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War
I _ would be a calamity. The Iraqis under Saddam are especially
sensitive on this issue, but they are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be preposterous,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a former U.N.
representative of the Arab League who now directs American
University's Center for the Global South in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world has two major popular causes: the completion of
the Mideast peace agreement and the end of suffering for the people
of Iraq. A military occupation would inflame a region where the
United States has little power of persuasion and little presence.
From Pakistan almost to the Mediterranean, the United States has
either no functioning U.S. embassies _ the case in Afghanistan,
Iran and Iraq _ or uneasy relations, as in Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of U.S. leverage in the gulf has prompted some
officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to
rethink the ``dual containment'' of Iraq and Iran and make
overtures to the Iranians under a more open president, Mohammed
Khatami. But sharp political differences within Iran between
Khatami's supporters and the ultra-conservative religious
leadership make any hope of using Iran as a counterweight to Iraq
problematic at best. While the U.S. overture to Iran was taking
shape, Saddam was getting bolder, not more hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would turn over the job of deposing Saddam
to his most opportunistic enemies. Congress has authorized $97
million for military help to opposition groups like the Iraqi
National Congress and two Kurdish resistance organizations. It is
hard to find an expert on the region who thinks this course has any
hope of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similar judgments are made about hopes that Saddam's army, or
elements of it, will turn against him. A diplomat in Baghdad said
in an interview early this year that the Iraqi president has layers
upon intersecting layers of intelligence operations and more cells
of informers than anyone can count. A hint of trouble can wipe out
not only the plotter but his whole family.
</P>
<P>
   The same fear attends the professional middle class and
virtually all government employees, who have also taken the hardest
hit from sanctions, and are increasingly bitter about what they see
as a U.S. policy indifferent to their fate. Suggestions from
outside the administration that sanctions be redrawn or at least
tinkered with to free the middle class from restrictions on travel
and a range of foreign contacts have apparently been ignored. U.S.
officials say they cannot trust the Iraqi leadership not to use
such openings for its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. expert with years of experience in the region said that
perhaps only the manipulation of tribal differences in the Iraqi
heartland, where Saddam and his Tikriti clan are quietly loathed,
would have a hope of bringing down the regime from within. But the
United States appears to have no handle on these internal
divisions. And other scholars of the region, as well as many Iraqi
exiles, worry about who would take Saddam's place. His sons, Uday
and Qusay, described by many Iraqis as even more corrupt and
ruthless than him, wait in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over what to do about sanctions raises several
questions. Should sanctions _ above all the embargo on Iraqi oil
sales _ be withdrawn, leaving Saddam with no more propaganda
mileage to be made from his suffering people? Should this be done
before there is a strong, fail-safe arms-monitoring process in
place to keep an eye on Saddam? Or should the arms inspection
system, which Saddam has turned into his most effective pressure
point against the United Nations and the United States, be
abandoned while sanctions stay in place?
</P>
<P>
   ``No inspections _ and sanctions _ is much worse than full
inspections and diminished sanctions,'' said David Albright of the
independent Institute for Science and International Security in
Washington. His views are widely shared by experts wary of those
who believe that standard intelligence methods would be as
effective as inspectors who, as Clinton says, have destroyed more
Iraqi arms that the gulf war did.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the world just abandoned both sanctions and
inspections? There are those who believe that Iraq is no longer an
immediate military threat and that the penalties being paid by the
Iraqi people are too high to justify for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will never let this happen, officials
say. And within the United Nations, diplomats from many regions
fear the precedent it would set. ``You don't bargain with the
Security Council,'' a Scandinavian diplomat said last week, a day
before the Nordic countries joined in warning Saddam to get back in
line. The sanctions-with-inspections program created for Iraq was
once seen as a useful model for dealing with tyrants in a world no
longer eager to mount peacekeeping missions. Many diplomats do not
want to see it tossed out because of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leaves still one more alternative, and it may well
be the one that becomes reality. This option assumes that the
United States manages to keep sanctions in place indefinitely, but
with dwindling support from other nations. The sanctions are
already eroding. Hardly a week goes by when the press in India, an
old ally of Iraq, doesn't trumpet a new agreement with Baghdad.
Indians are selling Iraqis food and computers, and high-level
visits have resumed. Turkey is trading through the Kurdish regions
of northern Iraq, recent visitors say, and illicit commerce through
Iranian coastal waters is flourishing again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new ferry service from Dubai linked Iraq to the
gulf nations by sea for the first time since 1991. When Sfouq
Rashid, an Iraqi passenger, disembarked at the Iraqi port of Umm
Qasr on Tuesday, he told a Reuters reporter proudly: ``This service
extends a ray of hope for the Iraqi people. God willing, it will
break the siege on Iraq.''

FALCONS LINEBACKER REVELS IN CONTENDER STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lean has not made Jessie Tuggle mean. His last 11 seasons as
middle linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons have been so lean. A mere
58 Falcons' victories, a lousy 113 Falcons' defeats. The playoffs?
Two seasons in, nine seasons out.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, do no mention the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six seasons alone, Tuggle has struggled with his
Falcons dropping 10 games to San Francisco and winning only two. We
are talking terrible defeats. The San Francisco offense in those 10
victories helped the 49ers average 40.9 points scored. In 1994, the
49ers hit the Falcons for 50 points. In 1992, they toasted them for
56 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, they have really brought some firepower at
us,'' said Tuggle, now in his 12th Atlanta season. ``This game is
all about confidence. It is all about believing what you can do.
When the 49ers play Green Bay, they know they are in trouble. They
know that Green Bay hurts them. And they have fallen apart against
Green Bay. The 49ers for years have used that same confidence thing
and turned it on teams like the Rams and Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   On teams like the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we have beaten them, we've been determined,'' Tuggle
said. ``I remember Christmas Eve, 1995. It's the last game of the
regular season. We have to win just to make the playoffs and they
have to win to get home-field advantage through the entire
playoffs. We win at the end, on Terrance Mathis' great catch and
run for the touchdown, 28-27. That was determination. But you know
what? It's a lot easier to look back than it is to look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   So, let's look forward. San Francisco vs. Atlanta Sunday
afternoon in the Georgia Dome. Both teams own 7-2 records. The
winner stands alone in first place in the National Football
Conference West division.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the Atlanta Falcons seen this much hype. They have
never been 7-2 before.
</P>
<P>
   Last season they played before a home crowd as few as 36,000.
Sunday the Georgia Dome will be pumping with more than 70,000, the
team's first sellout in three years. Just last year, the Falcons
started 1-7. But look at this current streak: Atlanta is winner of
2 straight, 5 of 6, 7 of 9, 12 of 15 and 13 of 17. They have won
six straight overall. They have won six straight at the Georgia
Dome. They are tied with San Francisco for the second-best record
in the NFC, behind Minnesota's 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   And Jessie Tuggle is right in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   He is the NFL's leading active tackler with 1,638 tackles. He
has led the Falcons in tackles for nine consecutive seasons. He has
helped the Falcons defense rise leaguewide to first in fumble
recoveries, second in take-aways and second in rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, 33, grew up 40 miles south of Atlanta in Griffin, Ga. He
is 5-foot-11, 230 pounds, a small linebacker by NFL standards.
Tuggle, however, sets his own standards.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all of the tough years and embarrassing Atlanta
losses, Tuggle remained classy and persistent. When all around him
appeared to be crumbling, he remained focused, worked hard and kept
building. The Falcons coaching staff trusts Tuggle. They realize
what kind of leader he is. His peers respect him. His small size
but tremendous gifts of speed, quickness, technique and desire have
made him a Pro Bowl player in four of the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who as a senior high school linebacker was
5-10, 180 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers know they must account for a small giant. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm big on setting goals,'' Tuggle said. ``I had my jersey
retired at Griffin High three weeks ago and I was walking on the
field and getting flashbacks. I never imagined in my wildest dreams
that I could accomplish so much in football. I was a small
linebacker who went to a small college, Valdosta State. They said I
was too short to play pro football. But now I can look in the
mirror and hold my head high, regardless of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves, the Falcons head coach, looks for Tuggle to lead in
the locker room and beyond. He expects that Tuggle will lead the
emotion and spirit that his defense should exhibit Sunday against
the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Reeves came in here and took care of the little
things,'' Tuggle said. ``In practice, no sitting on your helmet. In
meetings, no caps. The weight room, everybody participates on the
same program. Little things that mean a lot and build a team. My
parents were like that. They had rules and they worked hard but
they never complained. They did all of the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easier for Tuggle to look forward now. Looking backward,
he sees how the 49ers on Sept. 27th in San Francisco handled the
Falcons once again, by 31-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fire burning inside this team,'' Tuggle said. ``We
are not going to let the 49ers come into our own backyard and
intimidate us. This game is different. This year is different.'' &QL;

   MOSCOW _ When the Kremlin finds itself in a tight economic
squeeze, it acts a lot like the sheriff in the Mel Brooks comedy
``Blazing Saddles.'' Pursued by a furious lynch mob, the sheriff
puts a gun to his own head and threatens to pull the trigger if the
crowd doesn't back off.
</P>
<P>
   As a bitter winter closes in, Russia has again tried to take
itself hostage. Kremlin aides have drawn ghastly scenarios of the
troubles that they say will swamp their nation if the West refuses
to supply billions in fresh aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rubles will roll off the printing presses, they warn, spurring
hyperinflation. The nation will default on billions of dollars of
foreign loans, leaving Western banks high and dry. The oratory has
even been salted with talk of the collapse of the Russian state and
the breakdown of nuclear controls.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the scare tactics have not worked. Call it
tough love, Russia fatigue or a simple capitulation to domestic
U.S. political pressure: For the first time in President Boris
Yeltsin's tenure, the United States seems prepared to let his
government fall flat on its face.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Washington has turned its back on
Russia. It is still spending hundreds of millions of dollars to
help safeguard nuclear materials. It is also sending $625 million
worth of food to keep Russians from going hungry and prevent a
breakdown of the social order.
</P>
<P>
   But having addressed the most serious security and humanitarian
problems, Washington is no longer pressing the International
Monetary Fund to provide billions of dollars in new assistance or
trying to prop up the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's hands-off approach has been spelled
out in a series of speeches by top State and Treasury department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``International macroeconomic support of the kind we provide
through the IMF must wait until the Russian government shows itself
willing and able to make the difficult structural adjustments
necessary for recovery and growth,'' warned Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money from outside will do no good if it is inflated away or
it if pauses only briefly in Russia before ending up in Swiss bank
accounts and Riviera real estate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, the Clinton administration's response is
hardly surprising. For most of the Yeltsin years, the Clinton
administration was closely identified with the market reformers in
the government like Anatoly Chubais, Sergei Kiriyenko and Boris
Nemtsov. Talbott went so far last year as to proclaim that Russia
had begun to turn the corner under their guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The West did more than talk. A three-year, $10-billion-dollar
program of IMF assistance was announced in 1996 just in time to
boost Yeltsin's re-election prospects. When that was not enough,
the West cobbled together a $17 billion rescue plan in July to help
buttress the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's expectations were shaken when the rescue plan
failed. Russia's reformers were forced to devalue the ruble and, in
a dubious bit of policymaking, slapped a 90-day moratorium on the
repayment of foreign debts held by Russian banks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the reformers were out, Yevgeny Primakov was prime minister
and a new coalition government seeded with Communists began to talk
about the need for greater state control of the economy and issued
a litany of potentially costly promises.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent billions trying to support Russia's free market
proponents without a clear victory, the West was not rushing to
spend billions more _ at least not until Primakov's team drew up a
detailed budget and economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Western response has been a rude shock for the Russians.
Viktor Gerashchenko, the Communist now in charge of the Central
Bank, and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov came to Washington last
month with only the vague outlines of an economic plan, hoping to
line up billions in IMF aid. They returned emptyhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Clinton administration's tough approach represents a
thorough rethinking of Russia is another matter. Critics say the
administration is rightly wary of bailing out Russia, but note that
the crisis came to a head when the U.S.-backed reformers were in
the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no self-analysis in Talbott's speech, as if we did
not play a role in what happened in Russia,'' said Thomas Graham, a
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
and a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say if the Kremlin is really prepared to take
the tough steps that would be required to pry loose the IMF funds.
</P>
<P>
   To try to soften up Washington, the Primakov team has pushed for
ratification of the Start-2 treaty slashing long-range nuclear
arms. It has also promised to limit the printing of new rubles and
pledged budgetary discipline.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the Russia's economic strategy is mostly just
talk. A test may come next month when the government outlines its
1999 budget, which will show how it plans to deal with its huge
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not done a lot of the things that worry us the
most,'' said the U.S. official. ``But no one has seen next year's
budget and it is still not clear who is really calling the shots.''

<P>
   GORNJE OBRINJE, Yugoslavia _ Some of the closest combat in the
half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the point of fighting room to
room and floor to floor, occurred near this village six weeks ago,
in the days before 21 women, children and elderly members of the
Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian forces, their mutilated
bodies left strewn on the forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   Piecing together what happened, from surviving family members,
ethnic Albanian separatist forces and official Serbian information,
a story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by
Serbian tanks, artillery and infantry.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered
unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took
revenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close
range as they tried to run away from their pursuers. According to
relatives who found the bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, was
decapitated, his brain left on display on the ground. Hava Delijaj,
65, was shot and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung
by a thread of skin. Young women and children who had run a few
hundred yards up a rocky path were mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, was found by her
father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more
than 24 hours after the killings. ``Blood was in her mouth and her
mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an
avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies.
``I moved her hand and at that moment she opened her eyes. I
realized she was alive. I tried to clean the blood from her mouth
and she put her tongue out.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj,
39, who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound when
they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre,
recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the
woods as the Serbs shot at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the dirt hitting me from the impact of the
bullets,'' she said in an interview, her nose still bloodied from
what she said was a heavy fall during her flight. ``First it was
machine guns, then grenades, then cannon,'' she said. ``Every time
I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settled in the
Drenica Valley about 150 years ago, was not the first in the
conflict that ravaged the Serbian province between March and
October and has now lulled into an uneasy truce. Indeed, the
conflict between Serbian forces bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia
and guerrillas fighting for the independence of its heavily ethnic
Albanian population first drew international attention with the
massacre of the Jasari clan in early March by Serbian units at
Prekaz, in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the killing of the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed
patriarch, Fazli, 94, who was burned in his bed, to the slaughter
of Valmir, 18 months, who was found shot, is the most thoroughly
documented so far. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group,
believes the knowledge gathered so far increases the possibility of
prosecutions by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague's prosecutors could also draw on the observations of
diplomats, human rights monitors and reporters who saw the bodies
scattered in the ravine where the victims were killed before they
were buried in shallow graves in the clan's nearby compound. In
other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been moved from the sites before
they were seen by independent observers.
</P>
<P>
   Further, family members who survived the assault have described
what they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around
Obrinje as the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept.
26, from their headquarters at Likovac, north of here.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Albanian guerrillas had fled the area around the
Delijaj compound, dispersing after what a senior commander of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce
combat with the Serbs. In the days before Sept. 26, he said, the
guerrillas _ caught in a Serbian pincer movement _ had decided to
fight rather than surrender. The fighting _ sometimes house to
house, even room to room _ took an unusually heavy toll among the
Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav army. He said
he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged with the
massacre of the Delijajs.
</P>
<P>
   In other major attacks during the conflict, the guerrillas
generally found an escape hatch. In Obrinje, led by another former
officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined to name, the
guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled grenades.
Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters that
at least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed in the
fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east. ``We took
weapons from 47 Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled Serbian media center in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers were killed in the
fighting, including five reservists who died when their vehicle hit
an antitank mine on Sept. 25. The announcement of 10 Serbs killed
in one action is unusually high.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of taking violent revenge is a time-honored
tradition in the Balkans. From 1991 to 1995, in the wars in Croatia
and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to a far lesser extent, the main
victims, the Muslims, avenged World War II massacres and new blood
feuds, driven into killing by leaders who exploited old conflicts
to carve new fiefs for themselves as the old, Communist Yugoslavia
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it appears, Serbian vengeance was visited upon the
Delijajs.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the clan said they had feared an assault on their
collection of mud and brick homes lining a rocky dirt track
directly opposite the village of Likovac, the Serbs' base just a
mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had pushed the rebels out of Likovac in August and the
guerrillas had established new headquarters around Bajince, six
miles east of Obrinje. As the Serbs swept down from the nearby
Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that runs from Pristina to
Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be a target.
</P>
<P>
   Most women and children in the area had moved into Apple Valley,
where more than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking
safety in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below his
family compound would be a better hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the women, children and elderly would be
spared if the Serbs found them.
</P>
<P>
   As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the
massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim
Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj
said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shelling started again at 7 a.m. on Saturday and I saw a
tank convoy approaching, with infantry behind the tanks,'' Bashkim
Delijaj recalled in an interview. ``I was smoking a cigarette when
a grenade fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw
soldiers coming from about 30 meters away. They were in brown army
uniforms, had huge knives or small axes. Many had beards.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable to carry his father to
safety, and did not have the courage to tell him what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was getting the animals out of the barn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually received
shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and shelling.
</P>
<P>
   When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned to the
compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform.
They went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother,
Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain,
and the burned torso of Fazli.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked in the window of our house and saw only the bones of
my father, which looked like what we learned in biology class,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two men went to find out what had happened in the
ravine. There they found the bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer
Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his own tobacco
cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated in a
makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattresses. Then
Hava, 65, who was sprawled near the tent. They moved on to find
Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not
far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months
pregnant, had been mutilated, he said. A little further up the
ravine, Imer said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his
wife's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old
and recovering at a relative's home in Likovac.
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her under his
jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies of his
4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children,
Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses of other family members
were found in the woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen,
53, were found the next morning, Imer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, the bodies of two missing teen-age girls, Mehane, 16,
and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes at the side of a road
near an abandoned Serbian police compound. Later in the month, the
body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close to the ravine.
One uncle, Sharif, who was in the ravine, is still missing,
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting the Delijaj
massacre, has described it as the most vicious of a pattern of
attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. (To a
lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians,
forcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least
two massacres.)
</P>
<P>
   The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje killings
were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after the
victims were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch says.
</P>
<P>
   Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and
others that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying
the Serbian police officers during the fighting. They believe that
the police officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police
station, was used by the Serbian special police officers as a guide
to the Obrinje area.
</P>
<P>
   This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group of
ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs,
could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the
war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to
identifying the police and army units responsible for the
atrocities,'' said Peter Boueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights
Watch. ``It is vital that those who carried out these atrocities
are prosecuted by the Hague tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer Delijaj
has been acting as the host of a wake which, following Albanian
tradition, will last several weeks and began after family members
returned from their hiding places in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Color photographs of the youngest members of the family, and of
Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted behind glass on a
table outside the gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture
of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stands apart, a sign of ultimate
respect. An outsized Albanian flag with a black double-headed eagle
on a red field is draped behind the table.
</P>
<P>
   Imer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his words were spare as he
described his family's death. He did not express direct remorse for
allowing his family to use a hiding place so close to the family
compound, which for all practical purposes was an informal base for
fighters. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he was eager to be
helpful to investigators of the Hague tribunal, said in Pristina
that he believed Imer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the tribunal will closely examine the case remains
unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, has issued
only a handful of visas to investigators from the tribunal. Two
investigators who were in Kosovo at the time of the massacre left
six days later without visiting the site or contacting Krasniqi
about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sat on the floor of his
living room with a group of male visitors, he replied: ``It's easy
to answer. If I can see eye to eye with men I will fight them. But
only with men in uniform and in a fair fight. If I see children
with them, I will treat them like children all over the world.
Children are children.''

   PARIS _ The English like to poke fun at the French, but much to
their annoyance the French usually respond with indifference, which
perhaps explains why an obscure Gaullist politician enjoyed 15
minutes of fame in England this month. Here at last was a patriot
ready to defend his nation's honor in face of provocations by the
perfidious Albion. English newspapers chortled with delight. At
last, a reaction!
</P>
<P>
   All the better, in fact, because Florent Longuepee, a
33-year-old conservative Parisian politician, was quite serious. He
wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair to complain that the
Eurostar train from Paris to London via the Channel Tunnel arrives
at Waterloo Station. This reminder of a famous British military
victory over the French could distress French travelers, he said.
In the name of European entente, he suggested, the station should
be renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is not a joke,'' he insisted in a telephone
interview. ``Do you think General De Gaulle would have agreed to
inaugurate the Eurostar at Waterloo Station?'' Well, no. De Gaulle
would not even allow Britain to join the European Community.
</P>
<P>
   Longuepee went further (although not as far as actually taking
the Eurostar to Waterloo). If Whitehall rejected his suggestion, he
said he would propose changing the name of the Paris terminus of
the Eurostar from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Fontenoy, after a
1745 battle in Belgium where French troops defeated the English,
even after gallantly inviting ``Messieurs les Anglais'' to fire
first.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers, never embarrassed to joust with jingoism,
seemed cheered to learn that some of the French were still hurting
over Napoleon's 1815 trouncing at Waterloo. ``If the French really
want to rename the Gare du Nord, they should choose a more
celebrated Norman victory, say, Hastings,'' The London Times said.
And, the French were also reminded, didn't Paris also have railway
and metro stations named after great military victories (albeit not
over England)?
</P>
<P>
   Downing Street was naturally called on to respond, even though
Longuepee admitted he was not speaking for the French government.
``We only received the letter yesterday,'' a Blair spokeswoman
said, ``and it is in French, so it is being translated.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that really necessary? Isn't Blair rather proud of his fluent
French?
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister is away,'' she said. ``Anyway, there are no
plans to change the name of Waterloo Station.'' Well, of course
not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once again, the English had a laugh at the expense of
their traditional foe. Yet once again the entire episode said more
about England (though not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) than
it did about France. Put differently, the English remain obsessed
by France, but the fascination is no longer mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Longuepee's initiative was ignored in France. It is
becoming rather painful for the English. They keep making funny
faces at the French. But when France looks west nowadays, it sees
only the United States.

   Wesley Watkins IV, a 23-year-old Stanford University graduate
from Oakland, Calif., was accepted to a doctoral program in music
education in England. But, unable to afford the $17,000 annual fees
at Reading University, he searched the World Wide Web for
scholarship possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins chanced upon World Education Access, which vowed a
``scholarship for everyone.'' He ``joined'' the organization over
the summer for $1,289. In exchange, he was told, his tuition would
be covered. He flew to England last month. The money never came.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, while a few individuals have received
money from World Education Access, based in Dayton, Ohio, others _
or sometimes the colleges they had expected to attend _ received
invalid checks, or no checks at all.
</P>
<P>
   Among the institutional victims are St. Leo's College in
Florida; the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio; Franciscan
University of Steubenville, Ohio, and Geneva College in Beaver
Falls, Pa. Federal and Ohio state authorities are investigating,
but they declined to characterize the operation.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of a college education rises, and the cost of not
having one soars in an increasingly competitive society,
scholarship brokers have proliferated, many on the Internet. The
Federal Trade Commission and other watchdog groups say the
sometimes desperate quest for scholarship money has produced new
victims for con artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholarship scams are increasing,'' said Dana Lesemann, a
lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. ``We have recently filed
eight lawsuits against companies engaged in activities we consider
fraudulent. There were some 19,000 victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesemann said many were mail-based schemes involving the use
of picture postcards portraying smiling young graduates and a
promise that for a fee, often around $80, scholarships are
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the FTC shut down an operation in Maryland that
assured students that for a fee of $10 to $100, they would win
grants for $2,500 to $7,500. More than 50,000 people sent checks to
the organization, which used 10 different names. In most cases,
after the fee was paid, the organization was never heard from
again, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest schemes involve so-called personalized seminars for
students who meet counselors at airport hotels in exchange for
several hundred dollars,'' Ms. Lesemann said. ``The offer says the
counselor will find the appropriate financial aid program and fill
out all the forms for you. Some people are even giving out details
of their checking accounts for direct withdrawals, a good way to be
robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of a Web site, finaid.org,
estimates that there are 150 dishonest scholarship schemes a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total loss is something like $100 million a year,'' said
Kantrowitz, whose Web site offers a range of possible sources for
aid and alerts consumers to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes operate worldwide and sometimes include poor
countries, where an American or European college education is seen
as the best guarantor of long-term employment.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the United States, the search for scholarship money
has taken on something of a desperate nature as the federal
government has reduced its support and college costs have risen.
</P>
<P>
   John Joyce of the College Board said there had long been schemes
asking parents to pay for services they could have gotten free.
``Back in the 1970s when I started in this, there was a concern
over commercial scholarship search groups that would have parents
or students pay for services that gave them nothing more than they
could have gotten themselves,'' he said. ``After putting up the
money, the student would be told to apply for loans at banks or to
the federal government. What is happening on an increasing basis
today is that operations similar to that now exist on the World
Wide Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder and president of World Education Access, Simon
Kapenda, acknowledged in an interview having sent checks with
insufficient money in the account. He said he was in temporary
financial difficulty and would make up for failed promises when his
troubles cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda, 28, a Namibian immigrant, has made a special effort to
appeal to foreign students, many of them from Africa and other poor
areas, and many of them religious. He says he has done so because
of the scant opportunities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Muroki, a Kenyan national and Pentecostal missionary who
lives in Brackenridge, Pa., paid World Education Access $700 on
behalf of her church, Hope Ministry International, and was told by
Kapenda that he would pay for 10 students from Kenya, including her
daughter, Caroline, to attend Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The checks promised by Kapenda either failed to arrive or
bounced, Mrs. Muroki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking to myself, `What is he doing with the $700 I
sent?' '' Mrs. Muroki said. ``Why doesn't he return the money? He
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda's office telephone is often not answered. But, reached
by e-mail and then by telephone at his home, he vowed that he would
make good on his word. He said he was waiting for $300,000 of his
money to arrive from Angola, where, he said, it was being
improperly held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have enough money to cover it,'' he said. ``It was not my
intention for this to happen. I will try to fix whatever is messed
up. Maybe someone out there could send some money to the colleges
for these students.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda said that his money came from other ventures, which he
declined to specify, and that his only aim was to help those in
need.
</P>
<P>
   He has made good on a few promises, paying a handful of
students, like Gregory Head, who is studying at Brescia University
in Owensboro, Ky. Head said he had paid Kapenda $700 and had
received nearly $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   Head said he had been skeptical of World Education Access and
had tried to check it out. Like many of those interviewed for this
article, he said he had spoken directly with Kapenda, checked with
the Better Business Bureau, which had no record of complaints, and
after praying, decided to send in his money.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watkins, mother of Wesley, who flew to England expecting
his tuition to be paid, said she had spent a long time on the
telephone with Kapenda trying to understand how the scholarship
system worked. Even though she was suspicious, she decided her son
should give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so stupid now,'' she said. Her son has begun his
studies, and the family is looking for other sources of money.
</P>
<P>
   Kapenda said his new plan was for his Web site to investigate
and give a seal of approval to other Web sites, which would list
themselves with his site for a fee. He also hopes to become a
clearinghouse for educational assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of people out there with plenty of money who
don't know what to do with it,'' Kapenda said. ``I'm trying to make
a difference but it isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal authorities say they can not tell whether
Kapenda is dishonest or in over his head with a big, faulty idea.
</P>
<P>
   Without clear criminal intent, it can be hard for the
authorities to force the closure of Web sites, although Ms.
Lesemann, of the trade commission, said any promise not backed up
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kapenda changed his rules. No up-front fee from
applicants is required now and a promise of success is no longer
found on his Web site. But he said he had not given up on the
operation.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ I am a product of America's cities. For the first 40
years of my life, I had never been to anything like Price Club.
Dairy Queen was a once-a-year pit stop on vacations. I had never
car-pooled to a soccer game. In fact, but for a brief period a
decade ago, my husband and I never owned a car.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, we moved to China _ and somehow ended up in
middle America.
</P>
<P>
   Let me describe a typical Saturday here in Beijing, within
marching distance of the Great Hall of the People. We begin by all
piling into the sport-utility vehicle (a Chinese-made Jeep) to get
the kids to soccer. But wait: It's our turn to bring halftime
snacks! No problem; we'll just stop at the Dunkin' Donuts for donut
holes. In the People's Republic of China, I have become a soccer
mom.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, if the weather is warm, we might head to the
pool for a swim. Other families drive to stables for horseback
riding, still others to one of the many miniature golf courses for
a bit more sport.
</P>
<P>
   Later, there's a stop at the new Price Smart, Beijing's latest
cavernous, members-only supermarket, where we can buy 24 rolls of
toilet paper and vast containers of Tootsie Rolls. It's easy to
find, right next to a huge bowling alley and down the ring road
from a mall.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry? There are over 40 McDonald's. There's Dairy Queen and
Baskin-Robbins and the gleaming new Haagen-Dazs parlor that this
summer sprang up from the gritty pavement off Jian Guo Men Wai
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what the Communist Party means by ``socialism with
Chinese characteristics''! But isn't this what it's like in Des
Moines?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in case the skeptical among you think that what I'm
describing is just the lifestyle of homesick American executives,
diplomats and journalists, guess again. True, the soccer game was
mostly for Western kids. But the most jarring thing about urban
China is that it is the Chinese _ albeit better-off Chinese _ who
are packing the Pizza Huts, the Ikeas, the Putt Putt miniature golf
courses and the Clarins skin-care salons.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people here have never voted and the Communist
Party maintains a tight grip on politics, the market provides
plenty of choice in many spheres, to the small but growing number
of Chinese with disposable income. And they are making these
choices with the gusto of Bedouins who suddenly happen on a vast
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the fruit of middle America has been
quick to catch on in Beijing. The Chinese have seen it on imported
TV shows and longed for it for years. Middle America is
relentlessly clean and modern _ appealing in a country with a lot
of ancient relics but a shortage of functioning flush toilets. And
middlebrow Americana suits the still-limited budgets of Chinese
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus this year millions of Chinese paid $8 a head to see
``Titanic,'' but few were willing to shell out $60 (two weeks'
salary for a teacher here) to see a much-praised production of
Puccini's ``Turandot'' staged in the Forbidden City. It is probably
not a coincidence that the first joint-venture hotel in Beijing,
the Jian Guo _ which caters to both Chinese and foreigners _ was
modeled after a Holiday Inn in Arizona, not the Plaza in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of the city is still quintessentially Chinese,
with bicycles and pedicabs vying for position with horse-drawn
carts bearing high stacks of watermelons and cabbages. At dawn, the
parks are still full of old men in Mao suits doing tai chi
exercises, and the narrow alleys are jammed with vendors selling
Chinese pancakes and odd boiled eggs that taste like salt.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of such scenes with American-style bowling
alleys and indoor playgrounds gives Beijing its extraordinary
character. And the Chinese add their distinctive veneer to what
would otherwise be predictably American establishments. In addition
to Frosted Flakes, the Price Smart sells frozen jiaoze and fresh
dou miao, the dumplings and bean sprouts that are staples of
Beijing cuisine. The riding stables are staffed by former officers
of the People's Liberation Army and offer surly horses that respond
only to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   At McDonald's, workers teach children elaborate dance routines
that defy Western neurons. Grandmas, or nai nais, who would never
touch a burger nevertheless go to McDonald's to watch their
precious grandchildren scarf down Happy Meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I mostly dreaded trips to fun emporiums
like Chuck E. Cheese. But somehow here I don't mind the cacophony
of Fundazzle, an indoor playground sometimes flocked with whole
schools full of Chinese children, with a climbing maze the size of
a football field and a ball pit the size of a large swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   I like the sign there that reminds Chinese to put diapers on
infants. (Most Chinese toddlers pee right onto the street through a
perpetually gaping front-to-back slit in their pants.) I like the
elaborate charts explaining to education-obsessed Chinese parents
why the games are a scientific method of improving your one and
only child's hand-eye coordination, sequencing skills or attention
span.
</P>
<P>
   As the kids play, I sometimes chat about this and that with the
other parents, who I know by their age must have spent childhoods
separated from their families or living as peasants in the
countryside during the madness of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   We've come from such different places to be here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm perpetually surprised that so many Chinese can afford such
outings, with tickets to Fundazzle going for $5 per child in a city
where the average monthly income is officially $100. Even more that
so many flock to the new Haagen Dazs, where we hesitate to go
because the sundaes can set you back more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   But there are now Beijing residents whose spending power far
outstrips mine.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be caught dead owning our tinny Beijing Jeep, for
example, which we bought because high import duties precluded an
imported car. Some have even joined expatriate corporate executives
in whitewashed villa complexes in the suburbs of Beijing, places
with names like Celebrity Gardens and Capital Paradise, with
detached 4 bedroom homes, backyards and guards.
</P>
<P>
   We won't follow, even though I hate the city's pollution and
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban developments of Beijing feel too much like the
suburbs of St. Louis or Phoenix. You could be anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm grateful that moving someplace exotic gave me license
to get behind Price Smart's enormous orange shopping carts. Member
shopping is cheap and convenient. And, Manhattanites, if you're too
proud to do it close to home, come to China and check it out.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT TAKES TOUGH LINE ON PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Faced with a huge student protest and a
wild outbreak of rioting and arson, President B.J. Habibie said
Saturday that he would take ``firm action'' to curb what he called
subversive movements that threaten the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after soldiers killed at least eight demonstrators
and wounded more than 100 others, tens of thousands of students and
poor people filled a highway Saturday in front of the parliament
building in what seemed an unfocused and unguided outpouring of
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Their protests were supported by an unlikely ally: former
President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resigned from my position to avoid bloodshed,'' Suharto was
quoted by his half-brother, Probosutedjo, as saying. ``Why does the
government now cause bloodshed?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Habibie's government should apologize and listen to the
demands of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, in an echo of the riots that helped shake
Suharto from office in May, residents of poor neighborhoods
attacked shopping malls, banks, car dealerships, police stations
and Chinese-owned shops in a surge of looting and vandalism. One
police officer was reported to have been beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast with the riots six months ago, troops and fire
engines took action to quell the riots and douse the flames. Their
ability to bring the first outbreaks of violence under control
Saturday appeared to confirm suspicions that the earlier riots had
been allowed and even instigated by elements of the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the nation, Habibie took a tough line against
the demonstrators who had protested against a parliamentary session
he had organized last week and had called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a response that recalled the attitudes of his mentor,
Suharto, he said the protests had revealed the presence of
``subversive movements and actions that are endangering the unity
and cohesion and the fundamentals of the life of the nation and
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had ordered the military to ``immediately take firm
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the governor of Jakarta, Sutiyoso, announced a
curfew over the weekend for the capital city from 10 p.m. until
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said it was unclear what groups Habibie might
have in mind, or whether he or his military advisers were using
accusations of subversion, as Suharto did, as an excuse for a
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday, the military calmed the growing crowds of
demonstrators with a tactfulness that contrasted with the sheer
rage the soldiers had exhibited when they gunned down students
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The key element, Indonesians said, was that most of the crowd
control was handed over Saturday to the marines in their pink
berets, a seasoned force that enjoys unique respect among the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooray for the marines,'' the students shouted Saturday
morning, along with, ``Down with Habibie.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of students and supporters swelled to as many as
50,000 during the day and was permitted to fill a highway outside
the front gates of the now-empty parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   They sang and chanted into the night as the marines stood guard
between them and the gates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as they gathered there shortly after noon, plumes of black
smoke were rising above the city's northern Chinatown and other
poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Chinese residents and their shops and homes were
particular targets of the May riots, in which nearly 1,200 people
died and hundreds of buildings were looted, burned and vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting Saturday was less widespread, but at times the mobs
of looters were so large that soldiers could only stand by and
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Military tents were burned in a park near the parliament
building and an army truck was burned near the University of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atrium shopping center, young men hurled rocks through
the building's glass walls from a nearby highway overpass, which
carried a red and white neon exhortation reading, ``National
Discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   They smashed the windows and lobby of the Atrium Hotel at the
back of the shopping center, forcing the evacuation of dozens of
foreign guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a warning to Habibie about what could happen when the
masses are angry,'' said Hariono, 19, a local resident, standing
among a row of trees that had been uprooted from a median by
rioters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at the Atrium that the contrast with last May was
particularly noticeable. A cordon of marines moved through the
crowd, clearing the area around the building, and a military jeep
patrolled the newly empty streets urging people to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for prayer,'' repeated a soldier with a megaphone,
as dusk fell. ``Go home and don't cause any more damage. You know
it will cost a lot and will take a long time to rebuild.''

   LA-STREET-NEGLECT (Los Angeles) _ Decades of neglect have left
Los Angeles with streets so old, cracked and potholed that the city
would need to double its road repair budget just to catch up. The
city needs to be reconstructing 350 miles of street annually to
stay apace with the problems, but only did 100 miles before Mayor
Riordan was elected and only 150 miles annually now. Without such a
major financial commitment to repair Los Angeles 6,500 miles of
streets, city motorists can look forward to further deterioration
of what is already one of the worst street systems in the country,
officials say. By Patrick McGreevy. (Will move in the ``a''

<P>
   LHASA, Tibet _ In a small movie-and-noodle house on a side
street in the Tibetan portion of this holy city, a pair of young
monks in red robes were watching a Hong Kong kung fu movie and
slurping bowls of the house special when the Dalai Lama's name came
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama is everything,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Tibetans, this young monk worships the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, like a god and a king.
Despite years of Chinese efforts to discredit Tibet's religious
leader and years of persecution of Tibetans who support him,
Tibetans still express such fanatical devotion to the Dalai Lama
that it is evident that China cannot ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Washington last week, the Dalai Lama said he wanted to
negotiate with Beijing for greater self-rule in Tibet, but warned
that there is such a deep level of distrust between his exiled
forces and Beijing that real talks may not be possible for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials are so strongly opposed to the Dalai Lama
precisely because he still has strong influence here, even though
he fled in 1959. They portray him as the tool of foreign powers who
want to undermine China's unity.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little room for a compromise that would satisfy both
Chinese and Tibetans during the Dalai Lama's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   All of this creates a dilemma for the Chinese when it comes to
dealing with the issue of succession. When the Dalai Lama _ who is
63 and apparently in good health _ dies, a replacement must be
chosen within Tibet, now controlled by China. Will Chinese leaders
try to control the selection with their own candidate, whom
Tibetans may or may not believe in, or will they try to prevent the
selection of a replacement altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans cling to the ancient belief that their religious leader
is reincarnated in a young boy somewhere on the Tibetan plateau,
and he can be found only by a deeply mystical and secretive process
that by its nature is open to manipulation and earthly
interference, as it has been throughout centuries of Tibetan
history.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Tibetans chose a Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Tibetan
elders traveled to a holy lake and waited to have visions, which
apparently came in only the most obscure way, reflecting simple
sounds _ ``ah,'' ``ka'' and ``ma'' _ that they later decided may
have been a reference to the northern area of Amdo, and perhaps to
the nearby monastery of Kumbum.
</P>
<P>
   Iffy as this may sound, the elders later explained their choice
of a young boy in Amdo, saying that he had recognized a rosary that
belonged to the previous Dalai Lama and claiming it to be his own.
The boy also identified the home monastery of the senior elder
among them, they said, despite their disguises as ordinary
tradesmen.
</P>
<P>
   When the local warlord in the region heard that elders were
looking for a reincarnation of an important Tibetan religious
leader, he demanded fantastic bribes to let the child go.
</P>
<P>
   Devout Tibetans say the procedure produced a remarkably
charismatic and graceful leader who now charms audiences around the
world with his arguments for nonviolent change in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, though
a cynic might observe that it came months after the Tiananmen
crackdown in Beijing, perhaps in part as a way to condemn that act,
which was unrelated to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The succession issue of the Dalai Lama is filled with irony,
contradiction, and paradox,'' said Cheng Li, a professor of Chinese
politics at Hamilton College in New York who is studying Tibet.
``It seems that the parties most interested _ the Chinese
authorities, Tibetan exiles and the Western world _ are all
hypocritical and inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders had a dry run for the succession issue when the
Panchen Lama, recognized as the second-most important Tibetan
religious figure, died unexpectedly at the age of 50 in 1989. The
results have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that exiled Tibetans might try to secretly name their
own Panchen Lama, officials in Beijing authorized a search group to
find a reincarnation whom they could control. They entrusted the
abbot of Tashilumpo Monastery, the traditional seat of power for
the Panchen Lama's sect of Tibetan Buddhism, to oversee the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A boy was duly found, in quite the same mystical fashion that
produced the Dalai Lama. But the boy's name was quietly passed to
the Dalai Lama, who approved the choice before Beijing had a chance
to announce it. Beijing was so angered that it denounced the boy,
put his parents under detention, arrested the abbot who had been in
charge of the process and announced that a new boy would be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Advised that past disagreements over the selection of a
religious leader had sometimes been settled by drawing ivory lots
from a holy golden urn, Beijing leaders chose this method.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a spectacle: A senior official of the atheist
Communist Party overseeing an elaborate religious ceremony in
Tibet, declaring that only Beijing could be the final arbiter of
any choice. A new Panchen Lama was proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage was done. Today, most Tibetans seem to believe
the first boy, who has disappeared, to be the true reincarnation of
the Panchen Lama, and Beijing's second candidate to be a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, Chinese officials say, they may decide that
they are better off blocking the choice of any lama at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Chongying, the deputy director of the Minority and Religious
Affairs Bureau in Tibet, seemed to signal that as the preferred
course recently when he said, ``When the Dalai Lama dies, he dies.
There will be no replacement.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ First Thailand, then Malaysia, Indonesia and South
Korea collapsed. Then Hong Kong and Singapore fell ill. Japan, the
onetime powerhouse, sank back into recession. Not to mention
neighbor Russia's fall into the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all China has continued to slog along, its economy
bowed but not entirely broken.
</P>
<P>
   If its growth so far this year, officially said to be something
more than 7 percent, is sluggish by recent Chinese standards, it
looks spectacular compared to the rest of Asia's economies. And
despite months of intense global speculation, China's currency has
not been devalued.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, President Jiang Zemin will go with some pride to
Malaysia for a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China has definitely entered a politically dangerous era of
slower growth and rising unemployment. The signs of trouble are
everywhere: it is hard to find a family in which at least someone
has not been laid off in the last year or two, and in cities like
Shanghai and Beijing, new commercial buildings stand half-empty.
Around the country, protests by laid-off workers or retirees
demanding overdue welfare or pension payments are almost routine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no sense of panic, and for every empty building,
another restaurant or shopping center seems to open.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders, anxious to head off a severe slump and social
unrest, are using every Keynesian tool at their disposal to
stimulate domestic investment and demand. At the same time, they
have delayed the badly needed overhaul of bloated state industries
and overstretched banks. Critics say China is creating even bigger,
more costly problems later on for its banks and industries. But
officials say they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining growth and fighting unemployment had to get the
top priority,'' said Li Shantong, a senior economist at the
Development Research Center of the State Council, or Cabinet.
``Unless these two goals are met, you can't address the other
problems like banking and state enterprise reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The program of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures has already
pushed tens of billions of extra dollars into state enterprises,
and data from the first nine months of this year show that
investments in capital projects, technology and real estate have
jumped 20 percent over last year and are accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   A central question is just how soundly the extra funds are being
spent. How much is going to build needed roads and irrigation
canals and innovative factories, as the government says it intends?
How much to build unnecessary office space and to help doomed
companies produce unsalable stockpiles, as critics charge?
</P>
<P>
   Because of some deft policy moves, longstanding controls on
currency trading and the sheer size of its economy, China does not
appear to face an immediate risk of repeating its neighbors'
debacles. Rather, the main concern involves the longer-term costs
of its all-out program to wrench up the 1998 growth rate to an
arbitrarily set target of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is not a short-term economic collapse,'' said Barry
Naughton, an economist at the University of California at San
Diego, ``but excess slackening of pressure on state-owned firms,
leading to serious problems a few years down the road.'' Still,
Naughton praises the stimulus program as sensible.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhu Rongji became prime minister early this year, he boldly
vowed to speed reforms that are essential to future prosperity.
Outmoded, money-draining state enterprises would be drastically
pruned and the survivors made to stand on their own. The giant
state banks, courting insolvency because they had long funneled
money to dubious state industries, would only lend on sound
commercial terms.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, and the inevitable layoffs of tens of millions of
long-loyal and cosseted workers, would be difficult under the best
of conditions. Now they have been put on ice as the government
pumps a new flood of money through the banks into public companies
and projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political pressures have forced the Chinese leaders to make
some decisions that will come back to haunt them,'' said Nicholas
Lardy, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, one
of China's sharpest critics on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   Lardy credits the Chinese with some skillful moves of late, like
curbing foreign debt by imposing new limits on foreign borrowing by
companies and banks. But he warned, ``The dangers of a banking
system failure are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say the banking problem should be manageable. But
at best, after the current frenzy of government-induced spending,
shaking out the state-owned companies and ridding banks of their
albatross of bad loans will be all the harder, the ultimate price
all the higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis hit at a time when China was already facing an
economic slowdown. Earlier in the decade the country had
spectacular double-digit growth, but also spectacular inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Tight monetary and fiscal policies tamed the inflation dragon
without a recession _ China's renowned ``soft landing'' _ but by
1997, with an 8.8 percent economic growth rate, the country entered
a time of deflation and excess production capacity. Some said the
tight policies had overshot the mark.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, global economic strains and the collapse of
regional trading partners took their toll. This year the growth in
exports has slowed sharply, and the inflow of foreign investment
has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   These twin reversals alone would cut two to three percentage
points from economic growth, said Yukon Huang, Beijing
representative of the World Bank. The government's stimulus package
is intended to recapture as much of that potential growth as
possible, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are walking a fine line,'' he added. ``They need
to keep the economy growing so they can pursue the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson of the Asian crisis is that in a seriously
contracting economy it's difficult for basically sound enterprises,
as well as bad ones, to repay their loans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stimulus measures have definitely come at a cost. In a
series of changes this year and last, China's banks were told they
would be held responsible for bad loans, and would no longer be
forced to dole out funds uncritically to state enterprises and
local governments with pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   But over the summer, as part of the emergency program to bolster
economic activity, banks were directed to expand lending to state
companies, again exposing the financial system to trouble as it
propped up moribund industries.
</P>
<P>
   This fall the government has used more direct fiscal methods,
issuing $12 billion worth of bonds to support infrastructure
projects and requiring the banks to lend an equivalent amount for
the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li, the State Council economist, acknowledged that the
lending standards of banks had been relaxed, but again said that
without economic growth, all else would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Official statistics show that both lending and investment have
jumped, but there is no way to sort out how that money is being
spent, and how soundly. Much of the extra punch may be seen next
year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Lardy ask why more of the new lending was not
directed to the emerging private sector _ virtually ignored by
Chinese banks for years _ which might spend it more productively.
Government officials say that is impractical on such short notice.
</P>
<P>
   In that, the officials are supported by Ma Guonan, co-director
of Asia-Pacific research at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong, who
notes that a transition to a sound system of private commercial
lending will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most state banks only know how to lend to state enterprises,''
Ma said. ``They just don't have the training to know how to
evaluate risk in lending to private companies.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's growth rate has become a matter of some contention.
Seeking to exude confidence, Zhu, in the best old style of the
planned economy, has firmly declared and repeated that growth this
year would reach 8 percent. Some critics say that even the 7
percent-plus figures registered in the first nine months do not
seem credible, compared with other indicators like falling imports
and slower growth in power use and freight transportation, as well
as declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last week even a senior government economist, Lu Benqiang, also
of the State Council's Development Research Center, told Chinese
journalists that local governments might be fabricating numbers or
investing in useless projects simply to increase the growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   If output in the final quarter of this year truly rose enough to
pull the annual average up to 8 percent, that would actually be
``terrible news,'' said Naughton, because it would imply such a
high level of wasteful investment.
</P>
<P>
   China's neighbors, and the United States, are closely watching
for signs that the government might relent in its political
determination not to devalue its currency, the yuan. Over the last
year, China was said to be suffering a competitive disadvantage as
other Asian countries devalued, making their exports relatively
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been lengthy debate among economists as to
whether China, with its particular mix of imports and exports,
would benefit from a weaker yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts feel that the case for a devaluation will
strengthen next year if countries like Thailand and Indonesia,
still reeling from the current crisis, begin to recover. So far,
stricken countries in the region have been in such turmoil that few
companies have been tempted to move in to take advantage of the low
exchange rates, investing in export industries.
</P>
<P>
   But if those countries stabilize, with exchange rates still
lower than in the past, they may begin to reap some of the
competitive advantages _ at the expense of China's foreign
investment and exports.
</P>
<P>
   With sluggish growth, declining prices and large unused
productive capacity, China's economy would benefit more generally
from a devaluation and the modest inflation it would promote, said
Andy Xie, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Expert opinion is divided as to whether there will be growth
next year at close to this year's level, whatever it really is, or
somewhat lower _ a dismal prospect for a country that is trying to
refashion its economy and that has so many underemployed people.
Much will depend on trends in the region and world, affecting
China's trade and foreign investment prospects. A prolonged global
slump could be China's undoing, since this year's stimulus measures
cannot continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Since his audacious announcement of reform measures last March,
Zhu has kept a low profile on that topic, saying little in public
as many of his hard-won goals have been set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no indication that China's leaders have dropped
the goals in principle, and no indication that his power as
economic czar in this perplexing time has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no alternative to Zhu Rongji,'' Xie said, ``and Jiang
Zemin knows that.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ At one time, Barclay's Bank here was losing 36
of its 1,600 employees a year, 10 times the death rate at most U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the private Minbank Clinic, where the senior managers of
Zambia's biggest mining houses, banks and industrial companies are
treated, about half of all appointments are AIDS-related.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Zimbabwe, a personnel officer confesses that he has
hired three people for each semiskilled job, expecting two to die
in training. Half the executives at another company refuse
promotions because an HIV test is required.
</P>
<P>
   In the mines, where one sick driller can cripple a whole crew,
some South African shafts are reporting 25 percent HIV infection
rates, and even higher rates of tuberculosis, which blooms in
weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   As the AIDS epidemic sweeps the continent, the underpinnings of
many already shaky economies are becoming riddled with cracks. As
one economist put it, the problems right now are merely insidious,
``but one day you'll wake up and they'll be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, the disease attacks educated urban professionals _
the backbone of economic expansion _ first. The loss of those
people can rob the continent of much of its potential. The damage
is immeasurable, economists say, because it appears in ways that
cannot be seen _ businesses that will never be founded, ideas that
will never be pitched, university departments that will never be
created.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern and southern Africa, where the epidemic is worst, the
economically strongest countries _ South Africa, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia _ have infection rates between
10 percent and 25 percent. Virtually all of those infected will die
within 10 years. West Africa's strongest economies, like those of
Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, have lower, but still scary,
infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS here, spread mostly by heterosexual encounters, hits the
economically productive hardest. ``It's men who may come from poor
areas, but now have social mobility, can travel, can afford
prostitutes,'' said Wayne Myslik, chief consultant for Lifeworks, a
South African AIDS-management consultancy, who has studied the
problem at companies all over Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known 1987 study in Rwanda showed that a pregnant woman
had a 9 percent chance of infection if her husband was a farmer, a
22 percent chance if he was a soldier, a 32 percent chance if he
was a white-collar worker and a 38 percent chance if he was a
government official.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and governments may find ways to avoid bankruptcy, but
the choices they make to survive will be cruel _ laying off the
sick, sending others home to die.
</P>
<P>
   For Westerners used to a system in which insurers and
governments pay for top-quality medical care, it is hard to grasp
the kinds of cuts already being made here. Never mind $15,000 AIDS
cocktails and costly cures for rare brain infections. Companies
that once calmly paid for coffins, hearses and funeral meals for
employees are now begrudging even that.
</P>
<P>
   Accurately gauging the impact of the epidemic is difficult. Few
companies know how many of their workers are infected. And no one
admits having AIDS, so experts must guess how many of the deaths of
young working people from tuberculosis, malaria and vague
complaints like ``bad chest'' are really AIDS-related.
</P>
<P>
   But the indications are that the disease is devastating to
family finances, widely variable in the damage it inflicts on
individual companies and government health budgets, and _ so far,
anyway _ surprisingly minor in its statistical effects on national
economies.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many industries in Africa rely on cheap unskilled
labor from the almost limitless pools of the unemployed, damage to
overall economies may be relatively slight, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cruel ironies of epidemiology, the survivors may
benefit economically, just as the survivors of the 14th-century
bubonic plague did when wages skyrocketed and farmland became free.
</P>
<P>
   The damage at the family level is easy to grasp. The typical
breadwinner in Africa has 10 dependents, and outside South Africa
there are no welfare systems. Poor families are devastated even by
a child's death, because the cost of medicine and a funeral means
they often have to eat less, sell land or cattle, or take healthy
children out of school.
</P>
<P>
   That returns a once-ambitious family directly into the hopeless
cycle of poverty at its nadir _ illiterate, ill-nourished children
hoeing small plots of corn to avoid starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Health Systems
</P>
<P>
   Strained Budgets Bring Rationing
</P>
<P>
   The next greatest threat is to medical budgets, both public and
private.
</P>
<P>
   Most African countries have annual health budgets of less than
$6 per citizen. Zimbabwe, for example, allocated $3.68 per person
in 1995, while the hospitalization of a privately insured AIDS
patient that year cost $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with bankruptcy, governments respond by rationing.
</P>
<P>
   The $15,000-a-year protease-inhibitor ``cocktails'' that prolong
so many American lives are out of the question _ the World Bank
estimates that one patient's dosage would keep 400 children in
school for a year. Most patients get the most common malaria drugs,
TB drugs and antibiotics. When their immune systems are so weak
that those stop working, they simply die.
</P>
<P>
   Even relatively rich South Africa says it cannot afford to offer
$80 courses of AZT routinely to pregnant and nursing women to
prevent transmission to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Workers for corporations face similar rationing, but the more
generous employers buy them more months of life. Worker health
insurance is rare; far more common are clinics on the grounds of
the mine, factory or farm. They offer as much as the company
decides it can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies cope by simply dismissing sick workers; rich
ones cap their health benefits. Even Eskom, the South African power
company known for its generous benefits, recently cut its medical
benefits for HIV-infected employees from $18,000 a year to $2,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees didn't scream,'' said Liz Thebe, Eskom's
AIDS-education administrator. Since South Africa's press is
unsophisticated about AIDS, protease-inhibitor ``cocktails'' are
seldom mentioned and few people are aware of them. Only a handful
of Eskom workers, most of them white, take them, Ms. Thebe said.
Others, who have heard that such treatment involves 60 pills a day
and harsh side effects, simply declined. Some ``prefer to go to
traditional healers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies react to the disease's heavy toll by writing
policies that require repeated blood tests. If a country outlaws
such requirements, they stop doing business there.
</P>
<P>
   In dirt-poor Malawi, Myslik said, there are only two insurers
left: the state-owned National Insurance Co., which is insolvent,
and Old Mutual, which insures only expatriate workers, not
Malawians.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Companies
</P>
<P>
   Some Cut Costs, Others Stress Help
</P>
<P>
   The third-greatest economic damage done by AIDS is to corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies will talk about AIDS in their work force and some
hide the problem even from their shareholders, so analyses of
losses are relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   At Indeni, Zambia's only oil refinery, AIDS costs doubled from
1991 to 1993 and surpassed the company's meager profits the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Botswana Diamond Valuing Co., whose 525 highly
trained sorters pick diamonds off conveyor belts full of mine
gravel, estimated that AIDS cost it $237 per employee, or 6 percent
of profits, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Botswana Meat Commission, which slaughters the country's
beef, its second-biggest export after diamonds, was losing $268 per
employee, or 8 percent of profits.
</P>
<P>
   At Muhoroni Sugar, a huge sugar plantation in Kenya, costs in
1994 were only $49 per employee, but they were expected to double
while the company kept losing money. (To keep this in perspective,
one must remember how low wages are in Africa. A typical Muhoroni
worker earned about $1,200 a year.)
</P>
<P>
   AIDS bleeds profits from companies in many ways: medical and
death expenses, funeral payments, the costs of recruiting and
training new employees; work hours lost because employees are off
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in companies that keep statistics, more
work-hours are lost to funeral attendance than to illness. Since
most Africans are buried in their rural home villages, attending a
relative's funeral means asking for up to a week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my tradition, I can have three or four mothers,'' said
Mulenga Kapwepwe, an executive at Project Concern, an
AIDS-monitoring group here, explaining that Africans consider
aunts, uncles and cousins to be immediate family. ``Before the
epidemic, things were loose _ I could go bury anyone in my extended
family. Now companies are tightening up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the potentially huge costs of accidents. ``I had a
guy collapse at the airport the other day,'' said an executive who
spoke on condition his company not be named. ``What if he'd been
driving his truck and hit a 727?''
</P>
<P>
   With brutally hard-nosed management, some companies can contain
costs. Although 20 to 25 of the 900 employees of Chilanga Cement
die each year, the effect on the bottom line is ``almost
negligible,'' said chief executive Patrick Gorman. The disease does
not even rate a mention in the annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The Lusaka-area company, which owns Zambia's biggest cement
plant, was sold by the government to Britain's Commonwealth
Development Corp. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its deaths are among laborers, who are easily replaced,
and the company is laying men off anyway, Gorman said. ``To put it
callously, it's achieving what we want,'' he said. ``Natural
wastage is letting us reach our manning levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Absenteeism for funerals had increased 15-fold between 1992 and
1995, but ``we've stamped on that,'' he added. A worker may leave
only for the funeral of a wife, parent or child without losing the
day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   White-collar deaths are ``surprisingly low,'' Gorman said,
though he had to hire back a marketing director because the two
successors he hired have both died.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's on-site clinic, costs are ``down to about $15
per head per annum,'' he said. ``We draw the line at AZT and all
these high-powered expensive drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   For each worker who died, the company used to pay for the
coffin, hearse, buses for mourners, food for the funeral meal and a
cash grant to the family. ``When I first got here, I tried to do
away with the whole thing and ended up in a three-month firefight
with the union,'' Gorman said. Ultimately, they settled for a grant
worth about $200.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum in Zambia is Barclay's Bank,
the country's biggest. Its employees are overwhelmingly
white-collar and high school or college graduates. With
subsidiaries across Africa, Barclay's is widely admired for its
AIDS plans, of which Zambia's was the first.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has never calculated exactly how much the disease costs
it, said Bright Nyirenda, who started the program. But its
startling wake-up call came in the late 1980s when it was legal to
give blood tests to job applicants: eight of the 10 interviewed in
the small city of Kabwe proved HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the company's ranks, ``young men ready for
promotion were dying,'' said Sylvester Mubengwa, Nyirenda's
successor as health and safety manager.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1992, the bank's annual mortality rate rose
from 0.4 percent to 2.23 percent. In the United States about 0.25
percent is typical. It has since leveled off a bit lower, with 85
percent of the deaths AIDS-related.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, many are middle managers. The typical
death comes after six years of service; the bank lost eight
supervisory or managerial rank employees last year and 11 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have been hard-hit are the secretaries to those men.
``The managers travel a lot, and so are ... exposed to
temptation,'' said Nyirenda, straining to speak delicately. ``Back
at work, they prevail over their juniors, and get favors from them.
With secretaries, it can turn out quite viciously.'' The bank has a
sexual-harassment policy, he said, but workers in impoverished
Zambia are desperate to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bank pays relatively well, it can fill its depleted
ranks by raiding other companies. Small firms cannot compete for
executive talent.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay's does not merely offer health lectures and free
condoms, as some companies do. ``It's bank policy to show
compassion,'' Mubengwa said, sitting under a poster of the
Barclay's eagle with a red AIDS ribbon on its wing.
</P>
<P>
   When an employee begins to show signs of sickness _ slackening
concentration, growing absenteeism _ Mubengwa tries to work out a
plan that eases the work burden, oversees medical care and suggests
disability retirement. Employees are prodded to prolong their lives
by living in healthy ways _ quitting smoking, taking vitamins,
avoiding new infections.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is frequently the case here, the employees often
deny they are sick, refuse HIV tests and try to work until they
die. In a legacy of mining-based economies, African companies
typically pay two to four times annual salary to the family of a
worker who dies on the job, while disability retirements are
pittances.

<P>
   The Economies
</P>
<P>
   Loss So Far Slight, but Potential Fades
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly enough, the least catastrophic damage from
the epidemic is at the macroeconomic level. Most of the 610 million
people in Africa south of the Sahara are subsistence farmers,
herders or fishermen. Those with formal jobs are usually laborers,
crop pickers or miners. Although they suffer and die, the economy
marches on indifferently. There are so many desperate job-seekers
that they are quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Mead Over, a World Bank economist, estimates that in Africa's 10
worst-hit countries, through the year 2025, the disease will reduce
growth of gross domestic product per capita by only 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although total GDP goes down when the sick do not grow crops or
produce goods, he explained, so many people die that those who are
left own greater slices of the economic pie. And he is quick to
point out that an 0.3 percent drop in growth is significant in
countries struggling to grow even 1 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists almost apologetically compare AIDS in Africa to
the 14th century's Black Death. That great scythe of bubonic plague
killed nearly a third of Europe's people in three years, but from a
cold-bloodedly financial point of view, the survivors did nicely.
With labor scarce, wages climbed, and ``a lot of people suddenly
had a lot more land,'' Over said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Alan Whiteside, an economist at the University of Natal,
in South Africa, noted, many African economies are shrinking, while
governments are selling state enterprises and trimming public
payrolls. ``Being cynical about it,'' he said, ``They think, `If
you're going to lose people anyway, do you mind how they go?'''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of deaths in the civil service has yet to be
calculated. Business in Africa is intertwined with government,
which usually owns the telephone system and electric company.
Infection rates in the civil service are high _ in South Africa, as
many as one in seven are thought to be infected. In some countries,
civil servants, who have job security, may legally be home sick for
a year before being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   That is a crisis in the making, said Whiteside. ``You can't run
a company without electricity,'' he said. ``If the power company
loses its technicians, you can't generate electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most companies have been slow to respond, or are still
in denial, a few prescient ones saw the problem coming.
</P>
<P>
   That did not always help.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Rogers runs South Africa's best-known AIDS program for the
Billiton aluminum company in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. It
hands out condoms and brochures in every bathroom, gives health
lectures and aggressively treats workers for venereal diseases,
which increase the risk of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rogers even took a whole museum exhibit on AIDS from
Pretoria to Richards Bay, the little city around the smelters, and
found friendly HIV-infected guides to take 20,000 visitors through
and talk to them about their fears of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she was lucky. AIDS came late to South Africa because
anti-apartheid sanctions kept the borders closed _ though not
airtight _ until 1990. She might have had time to head off the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``for years, the unions blocked it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a belief that the disease didn't exist, because no
one had seen it. And some feeling that it was a plot by the old
government or the United States to keep the black population down
by getting people to use condoms. And there were objections that
condoms aren't part of African culture. And there are traditional
practices here that spread the disease _ such as when a man dies,
his wives become his brother's property so the land isn't split up,
and he is expected to sleep with them.''
</P>
<P>
   She slowly overcame a lot of that resistance, she said. Shop
stewards now double as AIDS educators, and the company hands out so
many condoms that at one point employees were taking an average of
6.2 per day each. ``I think I'm supporting a lot of small
entrepreneurs,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it may all be too late. The infection rate in
surrounding KwaZulu-Natal is now 30 percent, higher even than in
Zimbabwe or Botswana, Africa's worst-hit countries. Those deaths
are yet to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Last month, the Daily Telegraph, Britain's most
respected conservative newspaper, published a column by Tom Utley,
one of its regular contributors. Utley said the time had come for
him to make a public confession: He didn't like gay people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my suspicion is right, the great majority of us still
believe, in our heart of hearts, that there is something nasty and
wrong about homosexual intercourse,'' he wrote. ``What has changed
is that it is no longer considered respectable to say so publicly.
Whereas half a century ago, it was a jolly brave thing to invite
scorn by admitting to a weakness for the love that dared not speak
its name, today all the opprobrium is directed at those of us who
disapprove.''
</P>
<P>
   Utley added that he was expecting a deluge of mail attacking him
for his view. Instead, he said a few days later, he had been
startled to receive the opposite: more than 500 letters in support
of his editorial. ``I do think people are mildly anti-homosexual,''
said his boss, Charles Moore, the editor of the Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   While the Telegraph was having its mostly one-sided discussion,
a larger debate was being played out in Britain over the issue of
homosexuality in political life. In recent weeks, one Cabinet
minister has resigned in disgrace after being beaten up and robbed
in a park known as a gay hangout, and the nation has been informed
that at least two other Cabinet ministers it thought were
heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fourth has been openly gay
for years).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew quite how to cope with this news, although Prime
Minister, Tony Blair said he didn't care about the sexual
orientation of his ministers, only their job performance. The Sun,
Britain's most popular daily newspaper, took the opportunity to
declare its fear that Britain was being run by a ``gay Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun then dramatically flip-flopped, saying that it had
changed its mind and would no longer out anyone who didn't want to
be outed. But its abrupt vacillations reflected a broader disquiet
in the country, which is in a serious muddle over homosexuals and
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more people coming out and that's why we
have a greater tolerance now,'' said Mark Watson, communications
director of Stonewall, a group that lobbies on gay and lesbian
issues. ``But Britain has always had a problem with sex as a whole.
We're not very good at discussing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that attitude that underlies a strain of traditional
comedy in Britain, in which sexuality is broached in innuendo or in
entendre-laden slapstick _ the ``nudge-nudge, wink-wink'' approach
lampooned so effectively by Monty Python. One of the stock
characters in the popular British Christmas pantomimes is the Dame
_ a cross-dressing man with a booming voice and hairy legs who does
things like strip down to reveal a pair of blinking light bulbs on
his chest. Everyone thinks he's hilarious; no one discusses why.
</P>
<P>
   But those things are associated with an older generation, Watson
said, and society is actually becoming more open. At the same time,
the law has failed to catch up. This is partly because until the
Labor government came to power 18 months ago, the country was run
for nearly 20 years by the Tory party, which represents an older,
more conservative generation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Britain has few laws supporting homosexual rights.
Consenting sex between two gay men in private was partly
decriminalized in 1967, although sex involving more than two men,
or sex in a public place (which technically includes hotel rooms)
is still illegal, as is sex between two men if either is under the
age of 18. Although the House of Commons voted to lower the age at
which gay men could have sex to 16 last year, the move was thwarted
by the House of Lords _ after a debate in which many of the Lords,
ex public-school boys, railed against the idea of ``buggery''
between teachers and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are no laws protecting homosexuals against
discrimination at work, and no laws giving gay and lesbian couples
the same rights as married couples, in housing, estate taxes, and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dichotomy between the laws of this country, which
are very restrictive, and what's actually happening on the
ground,'' Watson said. ``In London, certainly, there is a great
tolerance. London is probably one of the gay capitals of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bradshaw, a young and telegenic member of Parliament from
Exeter, was a beneficiary of the newfound tolerance during the last
election, when he ran as an openly gay candidate against an openly
homophobic candidate who urged people not to let ``the pink flag
fly over Exeter.'' When Bradshaw won the election, he refused to
shake his opponent's hand.
</P>
<P>
   But if life is becoming easier for him and others, why did so
many people agree with Utley's anti-gay editorial?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a generational thing,'' Watson said. ``The Telegraph
readers are the same people who didn't embrace Blair's new Britain,
who are being left behind by what is becoming a more inclusive and
tolerant society.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as Mrs. M. Williams from
Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire, one of Utley's fans, wrote
approvingly to the Telegraph: ``My sincere thanks to Tom Utley for
his clear and honest statement on homosexuality. I am sure he puts
into words the view of the vast majority.''

STARR RETURNS TO ISSUE THAT STARTED INQUIRY _ WHITEWATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than a week before he is scheduled to testify
before the House Judiciary Committee, Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has apparently abandoned his inquiry into President Clinton's
sex life, the portion of his investigation that repulsed most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr has refused to give up. He has aggressively returned
to his original mission, the Clintons' failed real-estate venture
named Whitewater, whose complexities baffled and bored most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Starr sent some remnants of his
sex-and-cover-up inquiry to the Judiciary Committee. The evidence,
contained in two boxes, related to Clinton's dealings with former
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, who accused the president of
groping her just outside the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Starr did not argue, as he had in his September
referral regarding the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
that Clinton's actions involving Ms. Willey constituted impeachable
offenses. He left that question up to the Judiciary Committee. But
Democratic members and critics of Starr chided his silence as an
acknowledgment that his sex-and-lies inquiry had run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that he was not retreating, within an hour after the
boxes were sent to Capitol Hill, Starr forged ahead on his
Whitewater inquiry, which was his mandate when he was appointed in
August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury here returned a 15-count indictment against
Webster Hubbell, a longtime friend of Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. In a case headed by Starr's prosecutors, the grand jury
charged Hubbell with fraud, perjury and impeding the inquiries of
federal banking regulators who had investigated many of the
original Whitewater accusations. Until then, it had appeared that
the Whitewater inquiry was winding down.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr remains especially interested in the role that Hubbell
and Mrs. Clinton played in a land transaction that helped lead to
the collapse of a savings and loan institution in Arkansas. Mrs.
Clinton is referred to in the indictment only as Hubbell's
``billing partner'' for work she had done on the land deal while at
the Rose law firm. In 1996, Mrs. Clinton appeared before Starr's
grand jury to answer questions about her work at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said Saturday that the
first lady would not comment on Starr's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The two maneuvers Friday surprised and confounded Starr's allies
and adversaries on Capitol Hill and at the White House. Both sides
had spent much of the week preparing for his appearance before the
Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When told that the Willey matter had been sent to Congress
without an impeachment referral, one of Starr's most outspoken
allies expressed astonishment. ``How can they do that?'' the ally
finally said. ``That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic strategist gloated over Starr's most recent
decisions, predicting that they would further alienate him from a
majority of Americans, who have expressed distaste for the
impeachment inquiry in polls and the Nov. 3 midterm congressional
elections, in which Democrats did surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Starr telling the world: `I'm alive. I'm still here.
I'm still important,''' the strategist said. ``It seems to mean
that he is not going anywhere for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If last week was a guide, Starr's testimony will provide a
portrait of the divided and partisan Judiciary Committee.
Republicans hope to keep the proceedings focused on the accusations
of misdeeds by Clinton, while Democrats hope to portray Starr as
overzealous and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the partisanship, a Republican committee aide
said that the chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., planned to limit
questions by Democrats to the president's conduct and block all
efforts to attack Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' one Democratic strategist said, ``I think
there will be nuclear warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's decision to send documents regarding Ms. Willey to the
House without a referral was a departure from the September
referral on the Lewinsky matter. In that 445-page referral, Starr
argued that the president had committed 11 impeachable offenses of
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
authority. But many Americans criticized the Starr report as
unnecessarily lurid in its details of the president's affair with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Several opponents of Starr said they believed that some of his
prosecutors were angry that the report did not persuade a majority
of Americans that Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr is sworn in Thursday to testify as the Judiciary
Committee's first _ and perhaps only _ witness, he will undoubtedly
be asked to explain his office's recent moves and its plans.
Although Starr's allies say he looks forward to the opportunity to
explain and defend himself, they also say he will not reveal any
information about his office's continuing criminal inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Starr huddled in his office last week with senior aides,
drafting an opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony, which will be televised, and the public's
reaction to it, could have as lasting an impact on Congress'
handling of the impeachment question as Clinton's Aug. 17 grand
jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, Starr will switch roles when he is confronted with
hostile questions from Democratic committee members who intend to
challenge his office's methods and motives.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Starr's appearance will have a limited impact on
the impeachment process, which has been nearly crippled by polls
and the Democrats' surprisingly strong showing in the midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans are divided on what they want to hear from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a committee member, said: ``It's
going to be a good forum for him to explain his actions, and how
did he start in Whitewater and end up in the Paula Jones case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a committee member, said it
would be a ``wild goose chase'' to review how Starr ended up
pursuing the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope his presentation will focus on the central issues
concerning whether the president obstructed justice and lied under
oath,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican committee members hope that Starr's performance
re-energizes the impeachment proceedings, which many lawmakers
believe are doomed to fail when the full House votes on articles of
impeachment. To help the members, Republican staff members
distributed a memorandum of ``positive points'' about Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said last week that committee members also planned to quiz
Starr about other aspects of his four-year-old investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the indictment of Hubbell on Friday, Starr has not
provided his conclusions in his examination of the ties between the
Clintons and the corrupt savings and loan association in Arkansas
that was owned and operated by James and Susan McDougal, the
Clintons' business partners in the Whitewater land deal in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell has accused Starr of prosecuting him in an effort to get
him to lie about the president and Mrs. Clinton. Friday, Hubbell
told reporters, ``I don't know of any wrongdoing on behalf of the
first lady or the president, and nothing the independent counsel
can do to me is going to make me lie about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Julie Hiatt Steele, a former friend of Ms.
Willey, was informed that she was a target of Starr's inquiry. Ms.
Steele had initially confirmed aspects of Ms. Willey's account but
later disavowed it and has testified that Ms. Willey asked her to
lie about the incident involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, Ms. Steele's lawyer, said Friday that prosecutors
had tried to pressure Ms. Steele to change her story. ``They
thought they could terrorize her to go along with the program,''
Ms. Luque said.
</P>
<P>
   One issue likely to be raised with Starr is the accusation that
Starr's office received, through intermediaries, a tip about Linda
R. Tripp before she officially contacted the independent counsel's
office on Jan. 12 to disclose Ms. Lewinsky's involvement with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last month before a U.S. Court of Appeals, Starr
bristled at criticism of his office. He appeared
uncharacteristically combative as he defended its handling of the
Hubbell tax case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing exactly now what I did in 1994 and not a peep was
raised,'' Starr told the three-judge panel. ``I shouldn't say me.
I'm getting personal. The independent counsel.''

IRAQ BACKS DOWN, AGREEING TO ALLOW ARMS INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with preparations for an American
military attack, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq appeared to back
down Saturday and said that his government would resume cooperating
with international arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq cloaked its climb-down in statesmanship. But diplomats here
and officials in Washington said that Saddam, isolated
diplomatically by even his friends, apparently decided not to
provoke an American attack now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against
Iraq,'' the Iraqi leadership said in a letter to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, ``but as an expression of our feeling of responsibility
and in response to your appeal and those of our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials remained skeptical and said
that the United States would press ahead with preparations for a
possible air strike against Iraq. ``Public commitment by Iraq must
be followed by concrete and demonstrable actions,'' David Leavy,
spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday before
the Iraqi statement was made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi letter did appear to contain potential traps. It made
clear that Iraq expects or at least hopes for a speedy lifting of
the oil embargo imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
The United States has already dismissed that hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also said that in return they expected a
comprehensive review of their relations with the United Nations in
``a very short time'' after inspections resume. In letters on
Friday to China, France and Russia, the Iraqis said that would be
``within seven days'' of the resumption of cooperation. The United
States has suggested four to six weeks might be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also reiterated their preference for the review to be
carried out under the direction of Annan. The Security Council has
already said that it will run the review.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the Iraqis said that their decision was made at
meetings Saturday of the president's Cabinet and party, led by
Saddam. The meetings followed the receipt of a letter Friday night
from Annan reiterating the secretary-general's warning, in effect,
that Iraq could never hope to have sanctions lifted unless it
played by the rules, and by appeals from Russia, China, France and
Brazil, among others, the Iraqis said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the Iraqi leadership said that it was ready to
resume working with the U.N. Special Commission, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the two arms agencies
monitoring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of Iraq decided to resume working with the
Special Commission and the IAEA and to allow them to perform their
normal duties,'' the Iraqi letter, signed by Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, said. An unofficial translation of the letter was
obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint that Iraq would back down came from an unnamed
official on Saturday in Baghdad. A few hours later, Annan's special
envoy in Iraq, Prakash Shah, said publicly that the Iraqis had
agreed to resume cooperation ``without conditions'' with arms
inspections, broken off by Saddam on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   As Shah spoke, the secretary-general was meeting with Iraq's
representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, at Annan's
official residence in New York. There, Annan took a call from Aziz,
and they discussed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a last-ditch diplomatic gesture by the
secretary-general backed up by the considerable military might of
the United States and Britain appeared at least temporarily to have
averted an attack. Aides to Annan say they have learned by now that
when Saddam puts himself out on a limb, he needs a fig leaf to
cover a reversal _ or, as some describe it, ``a ladder to climb
down on.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general provided that with his trip to Baghdad in
February, when the United States last lined up a force in the
Persian Gulf to attack Iraq. At a news conference in the Iraqi
capital then, Annan made the point, though, that the military force
assembled in the region had made his mission possible, a message
the Iraqis did not really want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Annan made his last-minute appeal to Saddam in a
letter on Friday night, after a meeting with the Security Council
that lasted nearly five hours. The secretary-general, who had
abruptly cut off a trip in North Africa on Wednesday to confront
the crisis, said after the marathon session that ``events on the
ground seem to be running away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Iraqi president had been warned by virtually
all his erstwhile friends _ Russia, France, China and the Arab
countries _ that he would take the blame for bringing down American
missiles on his nation and people. Even governments that oppose the
use of force to settle this crisis had made it clear that the
Iraqis were isolated in their defiance this time and could not
count on help from them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The present crisis with Iraq, which came on the heels of a year
of confrontations, has its roots in a decision by Saddam on Aug. 5
to curtail cooperation with U.N. inspectors, who monitor
biological, chemical and prohibited missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   They and their counterparts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which watched nuclear developments, were forbidden to make
new, on-site searches and were restricted to using existing
monitoring systems _ cameras and air, soil and water samplers _ and
to making routine inspection visits to previously agreed sites.
This set off alarms here for the short as well as long term,
because the Security Council had intended the inspection system to
keep functioning, with unannounced searches, even after sanctions
were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Security Council and the secretary-general
were working on plans for a comprehensive review of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations, going back to the 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, when sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq responded by making demands about how the review should be
conducted and what, in advance, it should conclude. Baghdad
reiterated its insistence that sanctions be lifted and that Richard
Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission be
replaced.

CONGRESSMAN DESCRIBES `DESPERATION' IN NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea
last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there
was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans
might have starved to death in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who has had a longtime
interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo on his return to the
United States and showed photographs he had taken of North Korean
children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other
signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back a bag of what
officials called ``substitute food'' being distributed by a
government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that
even cattle would normally turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grind it into powder and make it into noodles,'' Hall
said. The noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving
people holding their aching stomachs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic
difficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of
how serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and
other organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a
bit better now than a year or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the
North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did seem to be slightly
better than during his three previous trips to North Korea. But in
rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed to visit, he
added, the overall situation is worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Based on visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that
public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital,
assistants were holding down a patient while surgeons conducted a
stomach operation without electric lights or anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, in part, because their
government's hard-line policies have alienated would-be donors and
aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly appealed for relief
aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal has raised less than
one-third of the target.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it was
pulling its staff of 13 from North Korea because it feared that its
aid was going to the politically connected rather than to the most
needy.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea does not release mortality figures or health
statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and
would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of North Korean
children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent
of all children are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that
overall at least 1 million people had died and that the total was
probably closer to 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the seriousness with which professional
demographers view the situation, the U.S. Bureau of the Census
recently published estimates suggesting that North Korea's
population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and has since fallen to
21.23 million this year. That would be a decline of 320,000 over
three years, a period when North Korea's population would have been
expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on the population
growth rate of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Eberstadt, an American specialist on North Korean
population figures, says that there simply is not enough hard
information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine. But
he notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution
stipulates that there should be one delegate to the country's
``people's assembly'' for every 30,000 citizens. This year's
assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather had just
687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North
Korea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected
to add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people
or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea, but
strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North
that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons
program. The United States warned last week that the ``agreed
framework'' that is the basis for its relations with North Korea
will be in jeopardy unless the North lets American experts visit
the underground complex and resolve their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has said that it will show off the complex only if
Washington promises that if the complex is not a nuclear one, it
will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.''
Washington refuses to pay, and North Korea is warning that the
standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their shameless and wicked demand is an open infringement upon
our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affairs,''
declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun.

DEADLINE IS SET FOR RULES TO CUT EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After an all-night session in Buenos Aires, negotiators from
more than 150 countries early Saturday set a deadline of two years
for adopting operational rules for cutting emissions of waste
industrial gases that are believed to cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
   With that, proponents of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty under
which the reductions are to be made, declared victory in the
two-week round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were low going in: U.N. officials, American
diplomats and environmentalists said at the outset that they would
consider the Buenos Aires meeting a success if it adopted a work
program for fleshing out the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   That was done. But beyond that, the treaty's backers said the
conference revealed a shift in the worldwide debate on how to deal
with the possibility of disruptive climate change brought about by
emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide,
which is produced by the burning of oil, coal, wood and natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Buenos Aires made clear, they said, that both industry and
developing countries were becoming more engaged in the effort to
control emissions and in trying to make the Kyoto Protocol
eventually work.
</P>
<P>
   Under the protocol, negotiated last December in Japan,
industrialized countries agreed to accept legally binding
reductions in greenhouse gases averaging about 5 percent below 1990
levels in the period 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol set up a number of mechanisms that was said to
achieve the cuts most effectively and at least cost. Chief among
them was a plan to allow countries to trade in emission rights, and
another plan, called the clean development mechanism, to allow rich
countries to invest in emissions-reducing enterprises in developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Argentina became the first developing country to
announce that it would assume binding targets and timetables for
controlling emissions. Kazakhstan followed. Honduras led a Latin
American proposal to speed up introduction of the advent of the
clean-development mechanism. Some African nations expressed
interest in becoming more involved.
</P>
<P>
   All of this led Stuart Eizenstat, the chief American negotiator,
to declare a ``sea change in attitude'' after the talks concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, many businesses have abandoned a
posture of hard opposition to emissions reduction in favor of being
actively constructive. A number of big companies, including General
Motors, Monsanto, Shell and British Petroleum, have recently
adopted such a stance, and Eizenstat said Saturday that their
representatives seemed to outnumber fossil-fuel industry
hard-liners in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Any such shifts should not be overstated, however. As Eizenstat
pointed out, there was still considerable opposition to the Kyoto
Protocol in the ranks of industry. The two biggest and most
influential developing countries, China and India, continued to
take a hard line against any sort of specific emissions reduction
targets for poor nations until rich ones are actually reducing
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone agreed with the Eizenstat assessment. ``I don't
think the business community is split,'' William O'Keefe, a
spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said this week.
While a number of companies are indeed taking a constructive
course, he said, few support the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the fossil-fuel industry and conservative American
politicians continue to portray the protocol as a misbegotten
instrument that will not work and will be too costly to the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said in Buenos Aires, as he has for
the last year, that the protocol will never be ratified by the U.S.
Senate. Under the rules of ratification adopted in Kyoto, the
protocol cannot go into effect if the United States does not
approve it. Hagel also minimized the significance of the actions in
Buenos Aires by Argentina and Kazakhstan, noting that there were
132 other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now that countries are coming to grips with what was decided in
Kyoto, he said, ``the cold stone wall of fact and reality has set
in, and I think from here on it gets pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat agreed. ``There are still very, very daunting
challenges,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nevertheless, proponents hailed the modest achievements of
Buenos Aires. The agreement on a deadline for fleshing out the
protocol ``insures that the nations of the world will continue
moving forward against the threat of global warming,'' Vice
President Al Gore said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, said the talks had resulted in ``forward progress'' and
``major strides.'' He said the decisions made in Buenos Aires
``have shown that governments are beginning to roll up their
sleeves and get down to the serious business of reducing greenhouse
gases.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the talks marked the start of ``a whole new
phase'' in which people are beginning to understand the value of
market mechanisms in reducing emissions. The two main Kyoto
mechanisms, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading,
rely on the market to achieve reductions.
</P>
<P>
   In the former, private companies in the industrialized world
would invest, for example, in high-efficiency power plants in poor
countries, which would thereby reap both environmental and economic
benefits. The two countries would share credit for the emissions
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   In emissions trading, a country or private company would be able
to achieve part of its emissions reduction by purchasing reductions
from a country or company that has reduced its emissions more than
required. In theory, this achieves overall global reductions faster
and at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, the conferees set late 2000 as the deadline for
adopting rules and regulations necessary for putting these
mechanisms and other features of the Kyoto Protocol into effect.
The clean development mechanism was given highest priority, but the
two-year deadline applies to all the features.
</P>
<P>
   Devising the rules will be no simple task. For example, the
European Union and some developing countries want to place specific
limits on the amount of a country's reductions that can be achieved
through emissions trading. The United States and other
industrialized countries argue that this would rob the free-market
mechanism of its effectiveness.

`CARLOS THE JACKAL' ON HUNGER STRIKE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The terrorist who calls himself Carlos has been on a
hunger strike for 11 days, protesting his four years of solitary
confinement in a French prison, where he is serving a life sentence
for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos, 49, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, has been
drinking water, and his life is not threatened, said officials at
the Sante Prison. They said they had no intention of changing their
treatment of him.
</P>
<P>
   In handwritten letters in French and English made available by
his lawyers, Carlos says he is preparing for his death and has
called on his supporters to kill one American or Israeli for every
one of the 1,551 days he has been held in France.
</P>
<P>
   French agents acting on a tip from the CIA seized Carlos from a
hospital room in Sudan in August 1994. He was brought here and
tried for murder in shootings, bombings and other acts of terrorism
that the authorities accused him of committing on French soil in
the 1970s and against French institutions elsewhere in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love France, eternal France, and I would regard as personal
betrayal any attack in my name on a French citizen,'' Carlos said
in a declaration in French titled ``In case of my death,''
distributed by one of his lawyers, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``By contrast, I ask as the last wish of a living martyr that a
United States or Zionist enemy be executed for each day that I have
spent in prison in France, and that's the duty of my comrades, of
all mujahedeen and of all the revolutionaries of the world,'' he
wrote, using the Arabic word for holy warriors and signing off with
``God is great,'' in the name of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Venezuelan Marxist lawyer, Carlos was named Ilich
in honor of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and was sent to Moscow to deepen
his knowledge of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
   After being expelled as a troublemaker from Lumumba University
in Moscow in 1970, he found his way to Beirut, Lebanon, and adopted
his nom de guerre at the suggestion of a leader of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Advocating violent struggle,
the group gave Carlos the first vehicle for his anti-American
revolutionary ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a series of spectacular actions that included the
kidnapping of the oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in Vienna in 1975, he allied himself with the
West German terrorist group Baader-Meinhof. For a few years during
the Cold War, he was allowed to operate from East Berlin, Budapest
and other Communist capitals in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book about him (``Jackal,'' published in London by
Weidenfeld &AMP; Nicolson), John Follain, a British journalist, says
Carlos sought refuge in Syria when the Communists tired of him. The
Syrians, learning that the French were on his trail, tried to expel
him to Libya in 1991, but the authorities there did not want him,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he wound up in Sudan, where he was recovering from an
operation when French agents, with the tacit approval of the
Sudanese authorities, pounced on him, wrapped him up in a burlap
bag and flew him to Paris in an executive jet.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in Paris last Dec. 24 of the murder of two
French police agents and a Lebanese informer in the Latin Quarter
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3 he began his hunger strike, he said in an open letter
to Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou, after being accused of
insulting a prison guard.
</P>
<P>
   The prison authorities disciplined Carlos with five days of
stricter solitary confinement, saying he had cursed at and insulted
the guard, who had interrupted a meeting with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know the professions of the mother of this
individual, or his sexual inclinations, and I did not yell at him
questioning his virility or his mother's morality,'' Carlos wrote.
``On the other hand, I did criticize his lack of civil courage and
disregard for his own origins shown by conducting himself like an
agent of colonialism.'' The guard is of West Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   He then vowed to refuse to take food or water to protest
interference with his mailing privileges and to demand the right to
receive visitors other than lawyers and take French lessons, Mrs.
Coutant-Peyre said. The prison authorities said Carlos had partly
broken his fast on Tuesday night by drinking nearly a gallon of
mineral water.

<P>
   KRASNODAR, Russia _ Here, along Russia's southern border, where
refugees from a crumbling empire have settled in the ruins of the
local economy, it does not take much to disturb the festering sores
of Russian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   For Nikolai Kondratenko, a Communist-Nationalist elected
governor of the Krasnodar region in 1996, that enemy is Zionism _
or rather what he calls ``zionacrats,'' using a new code word for
Jews in government, finance and the news media. According to
Kondratenko and like-minded Russians, these Jews are part of a
sinister worldwide conspiracy to bring Russia to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   For local Cossacks, descendants of the swashbuckling czarist
horsemen who have been assigned by Kondratenko to help police the
region, the enemy can be Armenians, Turks, Chechens _ any nonethnic
Russians who have had the temerity to move here, laying themselves
open to charges they are responsible for crimes ranging from rape
to epidemics of head lice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cossacks patrol regularly, checking documents to see who has
complied with the region's arcane residency requirements, specially
written to ward off unwanted strangers.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups have put Krasnodar and
neighboring Stavropol on a watch list, a move that local atamans,
or Cossack chieftains, shrug off with a hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a hundred human rights complaints registered
against me personally,'' said Ivan Bezugly, a radical ataman whose
Tamansky Division is spread over eight districts, his booming voice
ricocheting off the walls of an office covered in Cossack flags.
``What do you want me to tell you _ that I personally burned down
the homes of Turks because of their outrageous behavior? Even if I
didn't, I have 44,000 Cossacks at my command who would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kondratenko, for his part, has chosen a more distant scapegoat,
albeit one historically favored by Russian nationalists. Like his
fellow anti-Semites in Moscow, whose recent diatribes have set off
a national scandal, Kondratenko attacks ``yids'' _ the word is a
Russian slur for Jew _ with total impunity, despite laws that
forbid the fomenting of racist hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The local Jewish population, now only 1,500 after a decade of
steady emigration to Israel, fears that unless someone steps in to
halt the governor's regular rantings about dark Zionist plots, the
words will eventually spread to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we don't feel anything _ not at work, in the schools or
on the streets,'' said Alexander Kaplan, deputy head of Shalom, a
cultural organization. ``But these things happen in stages. German
nationalism started 15 years before Hitler came to power.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Kondratenko's conspiracy theory is the prominent
positions held by a number of Russian Jews, some of whom were
architects of Russia's recent economic reforms, others the
so-called oligarchs who have amassed fortunes and political
influence since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, at a local ceremony honoring the 80th anniversary
of the now-defunct Communist Youth league, Kondratenko let loose
again. ``Why haven't we revolted against that scum, a bunch of
people for whom Russia, Russians, patriotism, the land of Russia is
something alien?'' he said. ``Their policy is the losing one, and
those who will continue torturing Russian will burn more than just
their tongues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kondratenko's stated convictions are shared by members of his
team, which was elected by more than 80 percent of the vote in a
region of five million people. If nothing else, their shared
conspiracy theory _ rooted in czarist-era paranoia about imagined
Judeo-Masonic cults, and Communist-era labeling of Jews as a
distinct nationality _ serves as a simple-minded explanation of why
one of the richest agricultural regions in Russia has suffered so
badly during Russia's seven-year experiment with economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the result of Zionism?'' asked Deputy Governor Nikolai
Kharchenko. ``The result is the collapse of Russia. Native Russians
never would have allowed all these reforms to happen. Of course, it
is all coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   The litany of economic failure here, particularly after this
year's drought-stricken grain harvest, is echoed across much of
Russia. Industry is in a slump and agricultural production has
dropped so low that Krasnodar, fearing more hardship this winter,
has taken the legally dubious step of blocking farmers who have not
paid back credits to the local government from ``exporting'' their
grain beyond the region's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The region also feels the strain of the migrations that began in
the late 1980s as the Soviet Union was collapsing. By official
reckoning, about half a million new residents, most of them ethnic
Russians, have moved here, drawn by Krasnodar's moderate climate
and its rich black earth.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the influx, the region has instituted stringent
residency requirements, skirting a recent ruling by the Russian
Constitutional Court that bars residency permits within the Russian
federation. Various nationalities here have fallen under varying
sets of rules: ethnic Russians, for instance, can be registered
provided they find a place to live _ a requirement that tens of
thousands of ethnic Russian refugees from the war in Chechnya say
they do not have the cash to meet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of all the groups that have drifted into Krasnodar in the last
decade, the Meskhetian Turks are the most unfortunate. Deported en
masse from their homes in Soviet Georgia by Stalin during World War
II, they were deposited in Central Asia where, in 1989, they were
forced to flee from a pogrom by Uzbek nationalists. Russia has
pressed Georgia to take them back, but it has refused.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the 13,000 Meskhetian Turks in Krasnodar, Tamal
Miradov is a regular target for local police and Cossack
vigilantes. Without Russian citizenship, or permanent residence, he
cannot find work and cannot even legally sell the house he bought
when he moved here nine years ago. To keep his documents in order,
Miradov must either register as a ``guest'' every 45 days at a cost
of 180 rubles (about $12), or pay a fine of 400 rubles each time he
is caught by police or Cossack patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't let us go, they don't let us stay,'' said Miradov,
who recently made a quick dash up the local highway to visit his
parents in a neighboring village, his eyes peeled for Cossack
patrols. ``If I see the police, or the Cossacks, I have to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But some local officials are clearly fed up with the kind of
``help'' they get from the Cossacks, who strut the street in
camouflage uniforms adorned by the odd 19th-century accessory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 78 nationalities living in our district,'' said a
police official in the Krymsky district, where Bezugly has his
headquarters. ``And crimes are committed by everyone _ Armenians,
Turks, Greeks and Cossacks. We work with the Cossacks, but now they
walk around, with handcuffs and nightsticks, and extort money,
claiming to be a security service.''
</P>
<P>
   In Anapa, a down-at-heel resort town on the Black Sea, local
Cossacks like to boast about how they administer their own justice
against an Armenian population, whom they blame for 70 percent of
local crimes, including six rapes that they say were never
prosecuted because of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Nesterenko, who gave up his job as an archeologist to
become a deputy ataman in Anapa, is happy to show off the plaited
leather whips that he says his volunteers have used against
offending Armenians. ``These are the traditional methods of our
grandfathers,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But a local police official, who declined to give his name,
refuted the Cossacks' claims that Armenians commit most of the
crime. ``You think I don't know who is spreading these rumors,'' he
said. ``For the most part, these things are not confirmed.''

JUDGE REJECTS MASSACHUSETTS LAW ON MYANMAR AS FOREIGN-POLICY
INFRINGEMENT

<P>
   BOSTON _ To some, it may smack of flower-power idealism that in
recent years two dozen U.S. cities have passed sanctions against
foreign countries, roaring like local mice against the ruling
regime of Nigeria or political repression in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   But to a U.S. District Court judge here, a state-level move by
Massachusetts to tilt at human rights abuses in Myanmar, formerly
Burma, seemed not sweetly quixotic but downright unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph Tauro ruled earlier this month that the
Massachusetts Burma Law, which largely bars the state government
from doing business with companies that trade with Myanmar,
infringed on the federal government's exclusive control of U.S.
foreign policy. He is expected to issue an order telling
Massachusetts exactly what to do about the law this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``State interests, no matter how noble, do not trump the federal
government's exclusive foreign affairs power,'' Tauro wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, and the announcement last week that Massachusetts
would appeal, set the stage for a legal battle that experts say
could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court and affect all such
local sanctions _ from New York City's recent moves to shun Swiss
banks unless they made restitution to Holocaust survivors, to Los
Angeles' current consideration of whether to pass a Burma law of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, advocates of such down-home involvement in foreign
affairs say, is the kind of groundswell for divestment and
sanctions that many believe helped end South Africa's system of
racial separation. If such a ruling had come out a decade ago, said
state Rep. Byron Rushing, who sponsored the Massachusetts law,
``Nelson Mandela might still be in prison today.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Thomas Barnico, the assistant attorney general
handling the case for Massachusetts, said: ``Our law is consistent
with U.S. policy and second, our law isn't the conduct of foreign
relations, it's the conduct of our own purchasing. We have a right
to decide with whom we'll do business.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argue that local sanctions not only violate the
Constitution, but also fail to influence the countries they target.
They say the sanctions' main effects are to hurt the ability of
American businesses to compete abroad and to complicate the State
Department's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our companies, and certainly nor we, in any way
apologize for the way the government of Burma operates,'' said
Frank Kittredge, president of the National Foreign Trade Council,
the lobbying group that successfully challenged the Massachusetts
law. ``Nobody argues with the purpose or objective. We just argue
with the means of accomplishing it, and we feel so strongly that
these international sanctions do not work.''
</P>
<P>
   In this global-market era, the opponents to local sanctions also
include foreign governments, which complain that the sanctions
violate international free-trade pacts signed by the United States.
The European Union filed a brief opposing the Massachusetts law in
federal court, and the European Union and Japan have brought a
complaint about it to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The law that touched off all this
local-state-federal-international fuss was passed by the state
Legislature in 1996, making Massachusetts the only state with such
an anti-Burma sanction. (A similar measure is pending in the New
York state Legislature, however, and New York City already has
one.)
</P>
<P>
   Called a selective purchasing law, it required the state
government to refrain from buying from companies that did business
with Myanmar, unless bids from those companies were at least 10
percent cheaper than the closest comparable bids.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of losing business with the state appears to have
influenced some companies to pull out of Myanmar, Rushing said _ at
least, he added, Apple Computer said as much when it left. But
Rushing said he did not know of any case in which the state had
actually rejected a bid from a vendor with ties to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The military regime in Myanmar has violently repressed dissent,
and human rights monitors accuse it of practicing torture,
perpetuating slavery and trafficking in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   While divestment was the main local sanction applied against
South Africa in the anti-apartheid movement, selective purchasing
laws and ordinances now predominate in the movement to pressure
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   According to a list maintained by the National Foreign Trade
Council, cities from Berkeley, Calif., to Boulder, Colo., to Takoma
Park, Md., and Cambridge, Mass. _ more than 20 in all _ have passed
such selective purchasing measures against Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   That is their right, argued Robert Stumberg, a professor of law
at Georgetown University Law Center who advises the Free Burma
Coalition, an umbrella group modeled after the anti-apartheid
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a core principle of democracy that the federal government
should not intrude on state powers to spend local tax dollars
unless there's an overwhelming federal interest at stake,''
Stumberg said. ``Neither the text of the Constitution nor the
politics of the situation reaches that level, and we think the
Supreme Court will agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumberg and other defenders of the Massachusetts law say they
also have an important legal precedent to lean on: a decision by
Maryland's highest court in 1989 that the city of Baltimore had the
right to pass a statute that withdrew its investments from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Tauro, in his decision, wrote that the Baltimore case did
not apply because the city was seeking only to modify its own
investment practices. Baltimore did not ``seek to influence
individuals or companies in their private commercial activities,''
he said. He also cited a 1937 Supreme Court decision saying that
power over international affairs ``cannot be subject to any
curtailment or interference on the part of the several states.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Tauro wrote: ``Massachusetts' concern for the
welfare of the people of Myanmar, as manifested by this legislative
enactment, may well be regarded as admirable. But, under the
exclusive foreign affairs doctrine, the proper forum to raise such
concerns is the United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Congress and President Clinton have spoken on Myanmar.
Clinton issued an executive order in 1997 barring new U.S.
investment in Myanmar, and Congress has backed similar sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems only to give more ammunition to both sides.
Opponents of the Massachusetts law say it is pre-empted by
Congress; supporters say that since Congress did not nullify the
law, it should stand.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, both sides agree. No such concerted challenge ever
arose to the local pushes for divestment from South Africa, as
college after college and city after city voted to divest. That
could be because the Myanmar cause has less popular support, some
say. Or it could be because the government has signed more
free-trade agreements since then, obligating states and cities to
keep their barriers down as well.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 15, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: URBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW, IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW,
WATERLOO-STATION-REVIEW and FOREIGN-FILM-TITLES-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL-GENERAL &LR;  (Will move in the `a' category.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW (Seattle) _ On Election Day, voters from
California to New Jersey indicated that the urban sprawl
controversy is becoming a political force. Voters across the nation
and across party lines acted to stop the march of new malls, homes
and business parks and to tax themselves to buy open space as a
hedge against future development. By Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ A Capitol existentialist drama:
the public wants the drive to impeach President Clinton to end, as
do most House Democrats and many Republicans. Yet the Republicans
and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have such a strange
synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other on and
on and on. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-SUCCESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should the Democrats be
rejoicing in their unexpectedly strong showing in the midterm
elections? If there is one recurring lesson in U.S. politics over
the past decade, it is that success can be dangerous. Politicians
are forever ignoring history and reading meaning into election
results that really aren't that significant, claiming mandates
voters never intended, and than paying a price for it. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ADVERTISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today's ads seem larded with
unbridled cynicism. Liquor ads promote ``responsible drinking.''
Cigarette makers offer not only the surgeon general's warning on
every pack, but also, on company-run web sites, advice on quitting.
Health clubs run ads warning customers not to let a prudent
diet-and-exercise regime give way to anorexia or bulimia. Are these
ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course not:
advertising agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of
the '90s. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   FBI-TERROR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Many senior FBI agents have
misgivings about Attorney General Janet Reno's latest task force,
which is the second time she has ordered a broad investigation into
a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. They fear it could
drive the FBI closer to the ill-defined boundary separating
legitimate criminal inquiries from those into political causes and
unpopular ideas. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The new federal law to revive
the nation's troubled public housing contains a provision that
local officials warn could paralyze that effort: it requires cities
to mix working families with poorer families from project to
project. By Randy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE-MEDICINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is alternative medicine
getting a free ride? Studies that support the value of
alternative-medicine remedies are seen as less rigorous than those
conducted on conventional drugs and other medical treatments. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  _ (Will move in the `i' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-FILM-TITLES-REVIEW _ American movies are often retitled
overseas with more literal titles. But the results can be jarring,
especially in Chinese. ``Leaving Las Vegas'' became ``I'm Drunk and
You're a Prostitute.'' ``Field of Dreams'' was ``Imaginary Dead
Baseball Players Live in My Cornfield.'' ``The Crying Game'' was
``Oh No! My Girlfriend Has a Penis!'' ``Interview With the
Vampire'' became ``So, You Are a Lawyer.'' ``George of the Jungle''
was ``Big Dumb Monkey Man Keeps Whacking Tree With Genitals.''
``Barb Wire'' became ``Delicate Orbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your
Head Can Hurt You.'' By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (United Nations) _ For more than a year, it has
been evident to governments in every region of the world that the
Clinton administration's policy of sanctions forever against Iraq
has run its course. A look at several other ways that the Iraq
problem might be resolved. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Moscow) _ U.S. to Russia: drop dead. Whether
it's tough love, Russia fatigue or a simple capitulation to
domestic political pressure, the United States seems willing for
the first time during the Yeltsin years to let the Russian
government fall flat on its face. By Michael Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-GAYS-REVIEW (London) _ The issue of homosexuality in
British political life has been forced into the open as never
before. In recent weeks, Britain has been informed that three,
possibly four, of the Cabinet ministers it thought were
heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fifth has been openly gay
for years). By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   DALAILAMA-CHINA-REVIEW (Lhasa) _ Despite years of Chinese
efforts to discredit Tibet's religious leader and years of
persecution of Tibetans who support him, Tibetans still express
such fanatical devotion to the Dalai Lama that China cannot ignore
him. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   WATERLOO-STATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ The French objection to the
name of the Chunnel railroad terminal in England: Waterloo. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-POPCULTURE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ A first-hand
observation of the growth of American popular culture and
consumerism in China. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ The statement was simple. Last year, In looking
at the tattered defense he inherited, Bill Parcells intoned, ``If
Victor Green leads this team in tackles again, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, look who leads the Jets in tackles as they take the field
against the Colts Sunday: Victor Green, the mighty mite of a strong
safety. And the Jets, so far, have not been in trouble. Indeed,
they have been thriving, their 6-3 record tying them for the lead
in the American Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   They also have come up with a novel way of using Green, whose
overall play has been a significant reason that the Jets' defense
ranks sixth in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11-inch Green, who barely weighs 200 pounds, will be
asked to shadow Ken Dilger, the Colts' 6-5, 260-pound tight end, as
well as support the run against the outstanding Marshall Faulk. And
for good measure, Victor, make sure you are back in pass coverage
when Peytn Manning is throwing deep.
</P>
<P>
   Green is one of only four safeties in the league who is leading
his team in tackles. In the 26 other instances, it is a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells looked at the team he inherited from 1996's 1-15
debacle, he saw a defense largely responsible for allowing almost
30 points a game. Green was the leading tackler. But at strong
safety, with his responsibility in stopping the run, many of his
tackles were 15 yards downfield. In other words, opposing runners
were breaking free and making it all the way to the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, and his defensive lieutenant, Bill Belichick, have
crafted ways to use Green's intense love of tackling runners and
allow him to do it not so far downfield. When the Jets bunch up
eight defenders to halt the run _ a scenario they are likely to use
against Faulk _ Green is part of that package. He has been all
season.
</P>
<P>
   So Green has a team-leading total of 51 tackles, while
strongside linebacker Mo Lewis, perhaps the most talented player on
the defense and the leading tackler last year, is second at 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my tackling is about 70-30 run to pass,'' Green said.
``My tackling carried me through college. I knew I wasn't the
greatest athlete. Coming into this league, I had to be good at
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is one of eight free-agent starters on the Jets' defense,
but the only one who was on the team the year before Parcells took
over. He is from Americus, Ga., attended a junior college in
Mississippi, and then went to Akron to play under Gerry Faust, the
former Notre Dame coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been a Southern person my whole life, and I wanted to
experience northern life,'' Green explained of his decision to play
at Akron. The Jets acquired him as a free agent in 1993 after he
was graduated with a degree in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Green says that ``week to week, I don't know what kind of
defense the Jets will put me in.'' That is because the coaches are
constantly shifting alignments and putting the opposition off
balance. It is a difficult defense to typecast. At times, there
have been four linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets defeated the Falcons recently, Coach Dan Reeves
told Parcells, ``We had trouble preparing for you.'' The Falcons
never were sure what the Jets were going to do. Green had a sack
that game, as well as forcing a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   He disrupts people with a vengeance, as if his entire career is
based on overcoming the initial impression he makes because of his
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Coach Parcells tells me I'm too aggressive, but I'm
very confident in what I'm doing,'' Green said. ``Maybe when you've
come up after being a free agent, you feel you have to keep proving
myself. I'm doing that now until I get the respect I feel I
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets did not use Green in such varied alignments when
Parcells and Belichick took over last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got more confidence in me now,'' Green said. ``They
don't double up on the tight end, which they did last season.''
They trust him now in single coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Green decided after last year that if he were to be a full-time
impact player, he needed the speed to keep up with receivers
downfield as well as the strength to halt players near the line of
scrimmage. He took off-season karate lessons, and spent hours
jumping rope. He also worked out in Atlanta with about two dozen
NFL players, and went one-on-one with the Broncos' tight end,
Shannon Sharpe. It was a constant duel that has helped him this
year. He is, by far, the most physical Jet in the backfield _ when
he is back there _ and certainly a dangerous man up front as he
attacks the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much of his talent is innate,'' Parcells
said, ``but he made himself into a good player.''

TEAM OWNERS CONTINUE TO LINE UP BEHIND STERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Sterling, the principal owner of the Los Angeles
Clippers, cannot understand why David Stern is being portrayed as
the villain by National Basketball Association players in the
league's labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him Easy Dave,'' Sterling said of the NBA
commissioner. ``I don't think Stern would ever take advantage of
anybody. I think he wants to leave something on the table for
everyone. I have my own ideas, and they're not consistent with
Stern's.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think some owners feel that since we create and
make the game and put up the seat money and take all the risk, that
perhaps we should get a more equitable distribution of the revenue.
Stern is going soft on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's conservative bent appears to be shared by at least
some of his peers, although they have lined up behind Stern and
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, in the standoff with the
league's 400-plus players. While union leaders, agents and players
have traded verbal attacks with Stern and Granik the past few
months, the owners have remained conspicuously voiceless.
Discouraged from talking publicly about negotiations _ Stern has
threatened fines of up to $1 million and the loss of draft picks _
the owners have remained mostly mum.
</P>
<P>
   But several principal NBA owners broke their silence last week
when asked about the dispute. Frustrated over stalled talks, they
were firm in their resolve to cancel the entire 1998-99 season if a
settlement cannot be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to gut the season,'' said Abe Pollin, the
chairman of the Washington Wizards and the league's senior owner.
``We went into this knowing that if we can't make a fair deal, the
season would be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, said: ``When you
have two sides that have deep resolve, something either gives or it
doesn't give. I love the game, but not at the price of another
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners are seeking to overhaul an agreement that paid the
players 57.1 percent of revenues last season. The contract allowed
owners to renegotiate if the players' share reached 51.8 percent.
While the league has offered a 50-50 split, the players want to be
allowed as much as 60 percent of revenues. With that 10 percent
chasm, the two sides have not held a bargaining session since Nov.
6.
</P>
<P>
   A marathon negotiation on Oct. 28 was perceived to be the
closest that owners and players have come to reaching a deal, but
since then momentum has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dumbfounded because I thought we were very close,'' said
one owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I don't know what
happened, other than what you hear about the superstar agents
ruining the deal. While I don't believe that, I do think there is a
deference to the stars in this league that you're seeing now. And
if the stars don't like the deal, everyone goes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the owners are hurting, but everybody's hurting. And
it's my perception that the owners can recuperate over time. I
don't understand how players with limited careers are going to make
this money up. It's as if 400 of them are sacrificing for the needs
of a few.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners who spoke also pledged their allegiance to Stern, who
like other sports commissioners during times of labor strife has
abdicated his role as neutral arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better served by having one voice,'' Colangelo said.
``I've seen many, many players quoted all over the place, and then
Billy Hunter, the agents. With Russ and David, I think it was the
wise thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stern, whose marketing genius and business acumen are seen
as having catapulted the league out of economic ruin as much as its
influx of stars in the early 1980s, taking on the mantle of
ownership may prove costly. He has less than a month to strike a
deal or go down as the first sports commissioner to lose an entire
season to labor morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell how David will be looked upon by the various
people involved, be it the media, the fans or the owners,''
Colangelo said. ``But I don't think there are any regrets from the
owners about the decision to make David and Russ the
spokespeople.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said: ``I'm the person who is charged with managing the
lockout, and if it requires us to lose the season, well, that's
part of my job. Right now, the business doesn't support the model.
Their view is that the owners are supposed to subsidize the sport.
If the union leadership is wrong, they will have cost their members
$1.1 billion. That's something our players are apparently all
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that having him and Granik speak for the owners was
an effort to avoid inflamed passions and destructive dialogue, not
to avoid dissent. ``You can search the record and you won't find
any statements talking about our players in a negative way,'' he
said. ``We work hard to counter that because this is not about
name-calling. This is about making a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Granik: ``If there was serious dissent, teams would find a
way of getting it out there despite the gag rule. It's not about
dissent. It's about getting a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said he did not
believe all the owners agreed with the league's current position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can speak with one voice is to silence all
the others,'' he said. ``They've also put all of the hawks on the
negotiating committee. You haven't heard from them yet, but if you
bring in some of these other voices out there, you realize there is
some conflict. There are owners who wanted the season to start
yesterday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If there are dissenters, they have kept themselves hidden.
Large-market franchises like the Knicks, the Los Angeles Lakers and
the Miami Heat take in revenue from a variety of outlets, including
local television rights, and are perceived to be among teams that
would not object to playing the season under the old agreement. In
the original vote to reopen the labor agreement, the Lakers owner
Jerry Buss and the Heat chairman Micky Arison, whose team will move
into a new arena next year, were the only two members of the
nine-member labor negotiating committee who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when a vote of all 29 teams was taken again last March, 27
owners voted to reopen the deal, including Arison and Buss. The two
dissenters were Portland's Paul Allen and Boston's Paul Gaston.
</P>
<P>
   Small-market teams with little chance to go to the playoffs are
the ones viewed as willing to cancel the season because they cannot
get a return on their investment. But six owners, on condition of
anonymity, said they would be unwilling to commit more than 52
percent of revenues toward salaries in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeVos, the owner of the Orlando Magic, spoke to The
Orlando Sentinel last week. ``I know they might not like it, but if
you want unlimited opportunity, then start your own business,''
DeVos said, referring to the players. ``That's what I did. The
players union implied that if any team was making $5 million, then
all the other money should go to the players. You have to be
kidding me. If you have a $100 million investment, I think you are
entitled to make a little profit, have a little fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling says he has faith in Stern to negotiate a fair
agreement, but like many of his peers, he is a vocal proponent of
shutting down the season if a new deal cannot be signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our players have said they believe this is forced
slavery and that their cars are being taken away for a horse and
buggy,'' he said. ``I guess I'm personally missing something in
this whole thing.''

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON AND CASHEN
</P>
<P>
   In explaining their end of the Bobby Bonilla-for-Mel Rojas
trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers explained that they needed to open
third base for Adrian Beltre, who played 77 games for them this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' new manager, recalled how he got his
break at second base with the Baltimore Orioles. ``I know how it
was when they traded Jerry Adair to free it up for me to play
second base,'' he said. ``I thank Mr. Cashen for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Cashen, the Mets' interim general manager, stood nearby.
At a later stage in Johnson's career, when he was a manager, he had
reason not to thank Cashen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Frank's decision to fire Davey,'' an executive of
another club said, recalling Johnson's dismissal as manager of the
Mets when Cashen was general manager the first time around. ``Davey
had a lot of things going on at the time, he was running pretty
hard, and Frank felt he was losing control of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET IS OUT
</P>
<P>
   Describing his meeting with Albert Belle that he had tried to
keep secret, Dan Duquette, the Boston Red Sox general manager,
said: ``It was just a general get-together. It was like an
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Duquette was told, Belle doesn't like interviews, or the
reporters who do them. Laughing, Duquette said, ``This was more of
an employment type interview.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Red Sox should have reached the point where they are
interviewing Belle for Mo Vaughn's job is incomprehensible. They
had a year to sign the team's most productive hitter and the city's
most popular athlete, but they bungled the task.
</P>
<P>
   The team's last act was to refuse Vaughn's request for no-trade
protection, saying such clauses are against club policy. The Red
Sox, with a grudging final offer of $63 million for five years,
wanted Vaughn to accept less money than he could get elsewhere. It
made sense, then, that Vaughn should want some assurance the Red
Sox wouldn't turn around after half a season or a season and trade
him to a team he didn't want to play for. But that club policy got
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Red Sox pursue Belle, who has slipped into free agency
through an unusual clause in his contract. Belle, who can remain
with the Chicago White Sox and earn a guaranteed $35 million for
the next three years, would most likely take the contract the Red
Sox offered Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston will offer Belle the same deal, and Belle will take
it,'' one agent predicted.
</P>
<P>
   OFFERMAN GETS HIS MONEY
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, 1995, the Dodgers traded Jose Offerman to the Kansas
City Royals. Three days later, the deadline for teams to offer
contracts to unsigned players, the Royals opted not to tender the
shortstop a contract. That step ostensibly made Offerman a free
agent, but he and the Royals obviously had reached a prior
agreement that he would nevertheless sign with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Royals tendered a contract, they would have to have
given Offerman at least $1.28 million, which would have represented
the maximum 20 percent cut allowed from his $1.6 million salary in
1995. But on Dec. 21, the nontendered Offerman signed for a
$900,000 salary, which represented a 44 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
   A far better offensive and defensive player than he was then,
the 30-year-old native of the Dominican Republic has more than made
up for that hefty pay cut. On Friday, Offerman, who has since moved
to second base, agreed to accept Boston's four-year offer of $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEAL WITH NEAGLE
</P>
<P>
   Before Atlanta traded Denny Neagle to Cincinnati for second
baseman Bret Boone, they considered trading him to Milwaukee for
second baseman Fernando Vina as part of a three-way deal. The
Brewers would have sent Neagle on to Cleveland for first baseman
Richie Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians decided not to make their end of the trade,
which killed Neagle for Vina and prompted Neagle for Boone. John
Hart, the Indians' general manager, has also been looking for a
second baseman and apparently decided he could deal directly with
the Brewers for Vina or use the threat of that trade as leverage in
his negotiations with a free-agent second baseman, Roberto Alomar.
Furthermore, Hart could still try to make a separate deal with the
Reds for Neagle.

   PACKERS KNOW GIANTS' GAME IS A BIG ONE
</P>
<P>
   As if the Giants don't have enough problems, when they play
Green Bay Sunday, they will be facing a very angry Packers team. In
particular, a very angry LeRoy Butler, the outstanding safety who
said this game is a must-win for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we can lose this game,'' Butler said in an
interview after the Packers lost to Pittsburgh on Monday night. ``I
would say this is one of the biggest games of our season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? We have to pour it on right from the start,''
Butler added. ``We can't look at the Giants' record and feel sorry
for them. We have to go there and treat them like they are the best
team in the world. We have to try and blow them out from the first
minute on.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that if the Packers lose, it won't be because of
coaching or anything else. ``It's all on the players,'' he said.
``It's up to us now. If we don't win this game, it's our fault. We
all know we need to win this game. No coach needs to motivate you.
This game is our season. We all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Holmgren did not take any chances during the past
week, constantly telling his team that the Giants are dangerous and
should not be taken for granted. What Holmgren fears is that the
6-3 Packers will look past the 3-6 Giants to the huge matchup with
the division rival Minnesota (8-1) next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with the Packers _if anything can truly be wrong
with a team that has six victories? It is not coaching, and General
Manager Ron Wolf, as he always does, has the team stocked with
talent. It basically comes down to the lack of a ground game.
</P>
<P>
   When running back Dorsey Levens went down with a knee injury
earlier this year, it left the team with a gaping hole. Even before
the backup Travis Jervey broke his ankle against the Steelers and
was lost for the season, the Packers were averaging a measly 79.4
yards a game rushing, second-worst in the National Football League
behind Carolina's 72.1 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Without Levens, they simply are not the same Packers. Opposing
teams have planned almost exclusively to stop quarterback Brett
Favre, and as great as he is, he alone cannot carry a team (even
though Favre feels he can). Favre's 14 interceptions in his last 5
games is the worst interception stretch of any quarterback in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Favre keeps firing away, and at times his will alone has
carried the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people talk about our running game, and whether or not
it's too much for me to carry this team,'' he said. ``I'll say
this: Who doesn't expect me to carry the team? I get paid a lot of
money to carry this team. People say, `Oh, are they asking you to
do too much?' Well, yeah, but I'm the guy with the ball. I want to
do that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre also had a warning for anyone who thinks the Packers, two
games behind the Vikings in the National Football Conference
Central, are out of the division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are people giving up on us, do it, jump off the
bandwagon,'' Favre said. ``But we'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAW REBUILDS A DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   One of the best success stories in football this season is the
Oakland Raiders, a team that has been bashed more in recent years
than Bill Gates. The owner, Al Davis, deserves credit for what to
this point has been a great hire in Coach Jon Gruden. But the best
coach on the team may be an assistant, Willie Shaw, who is emerging
as a top candidate for a head coaching position on another team at
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, Oakland's defensive coordinator, has been an assistant
with Detroit, Minnesota, San Diego, St. Louis and New Orleans. And
wherever he has been, it seems, the position he coached improved.
With the Raiders, Shaw overhauled a defense that was 30th over all
last year and is second this year. If that trend continues, it
would be the best one-season turnaround for a defense since the
merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have long relied heavily on man-to-man coverage in
the secondary, which is dangerous in the high-octane offensive
football of the 1990's. But Shaw has the Raiders playing more zone
defense and blitzing heavily. His defensive backs are left less
exposed and can take more chances, which is why the Raiders already
have 14 interceptions, compared with 10 all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   There will most likely be at least six coaching vacancies once
the season ends, and league executives are speculating that Shaw
will get one of them. June Jones, the interim coach of San Diego,
is not likely to be retained, and if not, Shaw could end up with
the Chargers, where he was an assistant in 1994. San Diego General
Manager Bobby Beathard knows Shaw well and thinks he is a solid
coach.
</P>
<P>
   IMPULSIVE PLAY BACKFIRES
</P>
<P>
   There are plays that coaches will spend hours working on, going
over every little detail. Then there are occasions when coaches
literally draw up plays in the dirt. That is what happened with
Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher last week.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, with the Steelers leading the Packers by 27-3,
Pittsburgh had a second-and-5 at the Green Bay 5. Cowher called a
timeout. To his left was the starting quarterback Kordell Stewart,
who was having a great game, and to his right was the backup Mike
Tomczak, a good player. Suddenly, Cowher had this vision. ``I
looked at Kordell, I looked at Mike, and there's this brilliant
idea that's 7 points for them,'' Cowher said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was called ``y-stick.'' Tomczak was put in at
quarterback and was supposed to throw a touchdown pass to Stewart.
Things went well early on in the play, but the Packers smartly
double-teammed Stewart, which caused Tomczak to hesitate long
enough to be hit by defensive end Reggie White. The ball popped
loose, and it was scooped up by defensive end Keith McKenzie, who
ran 88 yards for a touchdown. The play sparked a 20-point Green Bay
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Steelers won, they could laugh about the play after
the game, which Cowher basically designed on the sideline. Cowher
called it a debacle. Tomczak laughed when asked about the play,
saying: ``I was asked if I was ready to go in. I said yes. What am
I going to say _ no?''

   PASADENA, Md. _ Ah, the beauty of Venice on the Bay. Waters from
the northern edge of Chesapeake Bay quietly lap upon the beach. A
cool breeze blows in from across the water. Even today, with a
slight nip in the air, conditions were pleasant enough for Darlene
Patterson to wander down with her Doberman, Blue.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, Darlene, don't wiggle your toes in the sand. Who knows
what is in there.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Venice on the Bay, a neighborhood of about 175
people, have reason to believe that outsiders have been sprinkling
cremated human remains on their small beach. On three recent
Saturdays, neighbors watched as people tried spreading what
appeared to be ashes into the bay only to have swirling winds send
them back toward children playing nearby. One time, winds blew the
ashes toward a man who was barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   On the third Saturday, the couple living closest to the beach,
Jim and Pam Folderauer, videotaped a man emptying from a garbage
bag what once again appeared to be ashes. Mrs. Folderauer
approached the man and asked him what he was dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cremated human remains,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be dumping that here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock me up, if you want to,'' he said. ``But if you give me
any trouble, I will agitate you at night.''
</P>
<P>
   That conversation was recounted by B.J. Cullins, 75, a retired
railroad conductor who is president of the Venice on the Bay
Community Association. He said Mrs. Folderauer had grown so
frightened over the incidents that she did not want to talk about
them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to answer her door Thursday when Cullins brought
along a reporter to interview her. ``She was afraid somebody might
come down on her,'' Cullins said later.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Folderauers have not experienced any misfortunes.
Nor has Cullins, who said he had received three threatening
telephone calls, with a person whose voice he did not recognize
telling him not to make trouble about the dumping.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of human ashes fluttering in the local breezes has
left many residents unsettled as police search for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy world,'' said Ms. Patterson, 45, who has family
living in the area. ``Nobody's safe anymore. You've got to be
careful everywhere you go. Even here. That's why I carry Mace.''
</P>
<P>
   While cremation and dispersal of the ashes is an increasingly
popular alternative to burial, funeral officials say human remains
are more commonly spread upon cemeteries or large bodies of water
or simply taken home in urns for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there is anything wrong with scattering ashes
elsewhere. Jack Springer, executive director of the Cremation
Association of North America, said states generally allowed
unrestricted scattering on public property and scattering with
permission on private property.
</P>
<P>
   But that freedom could change in Maryland as a result of the
mystery at Venice on the Bay. With word of the strange dumpings
spreading quickly through the community, the problem of what to do
fell to Cullins, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years
with his wife, Elsie.
</P>
<P>
   As association president, he notified the Anne Arundel County
police. Mrs. Folderauer provided police with a license plate
number, but it did not pan out as a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cullins also contacted several state lawmakers, one of whom,
Joan Cadden, was concerned enough to write to Martin Wasserman,
Maryland's secretary of health and mental hygiene. She suggested
that dumping human remains on a private beach was, first, a
trespassing violation, but perhaps also a health issue. What if,
she asked the secretary, the remains were of people who had
undergone chemotherapy or radiation? Would that make their ashes
toxic?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Venezia, environmental health coordinator for the state,
responded to Ms. Cadden's query, assuring her that cremated human
remains posed no health threat.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cadden said the incidents at Venice on the Bay could
lead to a state policy regulating the dispersal of human remains.
She has a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with the Funeral
Directors Commission, a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very sensitive to this,'' Ms. Cadden said.
``People have the right to do with a loved one what they want, but
there have to be safety nets for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullins, meanwhile, has become something of a spokesman for the
issue of remains dispersal. He said he was interviewed Thursday by
an Australian television station. ``They have some nice beaches
down there,'' he said. ``They want to make sure they stay that
way.''

POLICE WATCHDOG RESIGNS; LOS ANGELES SET FOR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first person to serve as a public watchdog
over the Los Angeles Police Department resigned from the position
last week, criticized her bosses for undercutting her authority and
touched off concerns that the city's commitment to overhauling the
police was wavering.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog, Katherine Mader, who served as the department's
inspector general for less than three years before resigning
Tuesday, said her position had been ``bottled up'' by the city's
board of police commissioners and the board's executive director.
She said her lack of independence was a ``fraud on the voters'' who
created the position by approving a ballot measure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Ms. Mader said interest in aggressive,
independent oversight of the department was no longer welcome,
particularly since the new, politically popular chief, Bernard
Parks, took office last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics have changed,'' Ms. Mader said. ``The power has
changed. Right now, Los Angeles has a very popular police chief
with a very low crime rate; there has not been a major Rodney King
type of incident, so I think there is a lack of focus or a lack of
interest in wanting to scrutinize the Police Department in the way
that I thought the inspector general's office was supposed to
scrutinize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general position was one of the key
recommendations of commission created in the aftermath of the 1991
police beating of King, a black motorist, and the rioting that
ensued. The commission _ led by Warren Christopher, who became U.S.
secretary of state in 1993 _ proposed the position as one of
several changes to better monitor citizen complaints against the
police and oversee the discipline system by which officers are
governed.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been more than seven years, two police chiefs and one
mayor since the King incident, and there is concern that the city's
institutional memory and its zeal for reining in police officers
who abuse their power are fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that has always been of concern is that the
further away you get from the Rodney King beating, the less
passionate everyone involved in this process would be about
reform,'' said Paul Hoffman, a former legal director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mader's resignation came just weeks after the board's
president, Edith Perez, in a letter to Parks, tried to
significantly reduce Ms. Mader's ability to investigate complaints
by giving her access to ``adjudicated'' cases only. The constraint
was withdrawn after Mayor Richard Riordan said he did not want the
inspector general limited.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central conflicts between Ms. Mader and the
commission was whether she was to report to the commission's
executive director or directly to the commission itself. The
commission's executive director, Joe Gunn, has advocated that the
inspector general should continue to report to him. Though the
Christopher commission advocated a strong civilian watchdog, the
report's wording was unclear on who would oversee the position; the
language of the ballot initiative creating the inspector general
made it subordinate to the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Mader and the commission had agreed not to publicly
attack each other, her subsequent criticisms have led to an
unusually public bare-knuckle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn held a news conference outside Police Headquarters on
Thursday saying Ms. Mader's work was ``not up to our standards''
and that, before she quit, board members had wanted to dismiss her.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said further that Ms. Mader had never been prevented from
investigating anything or had her authority reduced, and the
commission was committed to having a powerful inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The issue appears to be headed for a charged public debate over
the scope and authority of the inspector general position, which
will be temporarily filled by a former member of the board of
police commissioners, Deirdre Hill. A City Council hearing is
scheduled for next month, and another hearing is expected before a
commission that is revising the City Charter. Ms. Mader has vowed
to become an outspoken public advocate in those hearings for a more
autonomous inspector general.

FROM A MODEST START TO A THREAT TO THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-JONES-RDP) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the young woman stood before the microphones
here on Feb. 11, 1994, and accused Bill Clinton of having made
sexual advances on her, not much of the world noticed or cared.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Corbin Jones said she was the Paula referred to in an
article in The American Spectator magazine that asserted that state
troopers procured women for Clinton when he was governor of
Arkansas. But she had been no compliant conquest as the article had
implied, Mrs. Jones said, and she wanted to set the record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Her accusations, made before a conservative political gathering,
drew jokes at first. But soon they would form a lawsuit against
Clinton, and eventually they would lie at the heart of an
investigation threatening his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Turning points, and especially the wrong turns, are easier to
see when the choices become part of the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Supreme Court had not ruled that a sitting president
could be sued? What if the attitudes of Paula Jones and her
husband, Steve, had not been hardened by cruel remarks attributed,
rightly or not, to the president's camp? Perhaps the suit could
have been settled quietly. In that case, the name Monica Lewinsky
might not have become public.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jones suit took on a life of its own, even an afterlife,
considering that it hobbled the president long after it was thrown
out of court last spring. Before it was settled on Friday, with
Clinton agreeing to pay Mrs. Jones $850,000 to drop her legal
claim, a federal appeals court was weighing whether to reinstate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the pleadings said, the suit became much more than
arguments over what did or did not happen in a Little Rock hotel
room on May 8, 1991, when Mrs. Jones was a state clerical worker.
It became inspiration for serious debate about social values and
the relationship between a president's private behavior and public
record _ but it also became comic grist for late-night talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mrs. Jones' press conference, Clinton denied the
charges, saying he did not recall meeting her. ``He was never alone
in a hotel with her,'' a spokesman said. (Later, that wording
seemed most telling to people who accused the president of relying
on nimble semantics as legal defense: Of course he and Paula Jones
were never the only two people in a big hotel.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hired a lawyer, Robert Bennett, a power in Washington's
legal and political circles, who called the case ``tabloid trash
with a legal caption.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week of May 1994 was crucial, said two of Mrs. Jones'
early lawyers. The lawyers, Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata of
suburban Virginia, said on Friday that what they had wanted that
May was a statement by Clinton clearing their client's name. A
settlement seemed within reach, they said, so they delayed their
suit.
</P>
<P>
   No such statement came from the White House, which, Davis and
Cammarata said, tried to create the false impression that Mrs.
Jones had hesitated on filing because she knew she had no case.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said on Friday he had known Bennett for some time and did
not fault him for the White House tactics. ``I certainly believe
you, Bob,'' Davis recalled telling the president's lawyer, ``but I
don't much trust your client.''
</P>
<P>
   So on May 6, 1994, just in time to meet a three-year statute of
limitations, Mrs. Jones sued the president of the United States
(and a state trooper who she said had conspired with Clinton to
lure her into a liaison) in U.S. District Court in Little Rock. She
insisted that her motive was not money, although she sought
$700,000. She attracted more legal and financial support from
conservative organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union urged the
federal courts not to postpone the case until the president left
office, as Clinton's legal team was urging. Judge Susan Webber
Wright ruled that the trial could be postponed, but that pretrial
questioning could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The president was able to joke about the case on March 25, 1995,
at the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington. One of the speakers was
William Bennett, a former official in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and brother of the president's lawyer. ``He does
something I can't,'' the president said of William Bennett. ``He
can talk to his brother anytime he wants to for free.''
</P>
<P>
   The jest told a truth: Clinton's legal bills were mounting into
the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A defense fund was created.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, a federal appeals court disagreed with Wright,
ruling that the suit could proceed while the president was in
office. Clinton's legal team said it would appeal to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   When the president asserted that his status as commander in
chief entitled him to immunity, some veterans derisively recalled
how he had avoided military service in the Vietnam War, when he
studied in Britain. With the election nearing, the
commander-in-chief facet of Clinton's appeal was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after Clinton was re-elected, a cruel remark of
murky origin began circulating: ``Drag a hundred dollars through a
trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark, which offended Mrs. Jones and hurt prospects of
settling the case, was attributed to James Carville, the
president's dagger-tongued political strategist. But on Friday,
Carville insisted that his remark, made at a Washington
political-discussion breakfast, was directed not at Mrs. Jones but
at Gennifer Flowers, who had said she had had an affair with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Carville said he defied anyone to listen to a tape of the
breakfast meeting and find any mention of Mrs. Jones, but that the
quotation has been misreported so often that it is accepted as
fact. (Now, he said, he bears no ill will toward either Mrs.
Flowers or Mrs. Jones. ``I hope the poor woman finds some peace in
her life,'' he said of Mrs. Jones, adding that he still believes
her suit was groundless and about ``money, money, money.'')

 WASHINGTON: money, money.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was another turning point in November 1996. The
lawyer-journalist Stuart Taylor Jr. analyzed the case and concluded
that the evidence against Clinton was far stronger than many people
thought. His article in The American Lawyer magazine carried
considerable weight among journalists.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, 1997, the case was elevated to constitutional status
as it was argued before the Supreme Court, on the question of
whether a sitting president could be sued for actions unrelated to
his office. On May 27, the court ruled unanimously that he could.
Wright then decreed that the trial would begin a year hence.
</P>
<P>
   One comment by Justice John Paul Stevens proved stunningly
inaccurate. The case, he said, ``appears to us highly unlikely to
occupy any substantial amount'' of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff, said on Friday
that the ruling set ``a terrible precedent for future presidents''
who might be beset by scandal and scandal-mongers while trying to
guide the country in peace and war.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis Michael Seidman, a Georgetown University law
professor, said he thought the court was right, regardless of any
disruption in the work of the Oval Office. ``Courts can get rid of
frivolous suits very easily,'' he said. ``This one wasn't
frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late summer of 1997, it may have been too late to settle.
Clinton's legal team was offering $700,000, along with an
expression of regret without an admission of wrongdoing. Davis and
Cammarata urged Mrs. Jones to accept, telling her that her position
would never be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jones had a falling out with her lawyers. Soon she had
a new legal team, along with backing from the conservative
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   As he rode in a limousine to give a pretrial deposition in Mrs.
Jones' lawsuit on the gray Saturday of Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton knew
he would be asked about other women as Mrs. Jones' lawyers tried to
establish a pattern of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone knew then that he had been involved with a White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Even fewer people knew that Mrs.
Lewinsky's telephone pinings and yearnings had been tape-recorded
by a supposed friend.
</P>
<P>
   At the pretrial hearing, Clinton was asked if he had ever had
sexual relations with Mrs. Lewinsky. No, he answered, under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, perhaps even days later, it might not have been too
late for the president to change his testimony, lawyers involved in
the case have said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had chosen a course of denial, one he would hold for
seven months. Over that time, one of the few bits of good news for
him was Wright's dismissal of Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. That happened on
April Fool's Day, but the president's troubles were still far from
over.

EFFORT TO MAKE PART-HUMAN, PART-COW CELLS TROUBLES CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that he is ``deeply troubled'' by the creation of
part-human, part-cow embryonic stem cells, President Clinton has
directed the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to consider the
implications of the research at its meeting Tuesday in Miami and to
report back to him ``as soon as possible''.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Saturday to the chairman of the commission,
Harold Shapiro of Princeton University, Clinton also asked for a
review of embryonic stem-cell research in general, including the
all-human embryonic stem cells whose isolation was reported earlier
this month. These cells _ the primordial, all-purpose cells from
which all tissues of the body develop _ were derived from very
early embryos or blastocysts and from tissues of aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   While the president signaled concern about the ``mingling of
human and non-human species,'' he was more positive about the
all-human embryonic stem cell research, noting that it ``may have
real potential for treating such devastating illnesses as cancer,
heart disease, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also stressed the ethical concerns raised by the
research, telling the commission that he wanted a ``thorough
review, balancing all ethical and medical considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent after the president had consulted with the
White House Domestic Policy Council and the president's science
adviser, Neal Lane, ``because he wanted the broadest views possible
_ the policy people, medical ethicists, as well as the
scientists,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   A political issue that lies in the background of the
commission's deliberations is the ban on federal financing of fetal
research. The ban, imposed by Congress, has created the situation
that university scientists, who mostly depend on federal money,
cannot work on the human embryonic stem cells whereas the private
sector may conduct whatever research it pleases.
</P>
<P>
   A group of scientists and ethicists known as the Human Embryo
Research Panel said in 1994 that research on human embryonic stem
cells should be federally financed, provided that the cells were
derived from excess pre-implantation embryos created for
infertility treatments. This was the source of some of the human
embryonic stem cells isolated earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the panel's report, Clinton said in December
1994, ``I do not believe that federal funds should be used to
support the creation of human embryos for research purposes.'' The
statement did not rule out research on excess embryos created in
infertility clinics but subsequent action by Congress banned all
research in which a human embryo is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to this history, the president said in his letter
Saturday that the ethical issues of human embryonic stem cell
research had not diminished since his statement of 1994 but that
the benefits had become less hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said the implications of human embryonic stem-cell research
had been under review but news of the human-cow hybrid cells,
reported last week, ``clearly raised urgent ethical, medical and
legal issues that the president wants addressed and that's why he
asked for the commission to give it immediate attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells can develop into any of the body's
210 types of cells, a process that happens naturally during fetal
development. Biologists at Geron, the company that supported the
research, hope to grow the cells in the laboratory and guide them
to develop into heart cells, blood cells and other tissues.
</P>
<P>
   The cells would then be injected into the patient and integrate
with tissues under the control of local body signals.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the method could address a range of otherwise
untreatable degenerative diseases, as well as relieving the severe
shortage of organs available for conventional transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Many serious technical problems remain to be resolved, including
finding ways to guide the stem cells down desired paths of
development and ways to prevent immune rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical problems are also important because of the source of
the embryonic stem cells. In one case the cells came from excess
pre-implantation embryos created in infertility treatments, and in
the other from aborted fetal tissue. Both sources were legal, but
research using the first would have been ineligible for federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   The human-cow hybrid cell also complied with all laws, said
Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology of
Worcester, Mass., the company that supported the research. In the
hybrid cell, the cow cell's nucleus is first removed and the cow
proteins are expected to be rapidly replaced with human proteins as
the human nucleus takes over the cell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mingling of species raises many questions,
scientists at Advanced Cell Technology regard the operation as one
in which the cow egg is used simply to make the human cell's
nucleus revert to its embryonic state. As the human cells can be
provided by the patient himself, from blood or skin, there is no
immune rejection when developed cells grown from his embryonic
state cells are injected back into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Cell Technology performed its cow-human hybrid
experiment only once, three years ago, and took the study only to a
very preliminary stage. Other scientists say more evidence is
needed to verify whether embryonic stem-like cells were created.
</P>
<P>
   West said he was announcing the research now to test its public
acceptability before making further investments in the technique.

REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN UNDER PRESSURE  
 BACKTRACKING IN CALIFORNIA  
 HUSH-HUSH DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Fla., Mich., Ind., Calif., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is not the only place where Republicans are looking for
leaders to blame, and maybe dump, because of the party's
embarrassing setbacks on Election Day. The chairman of the party,
Jim Nicholson, also is coming under some fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, a Colorado real estate developer who has held state
and national party posts for the last 12 years, was elected party
chairman in early 1997 by the Republican National Committee. All
indications were that the party was happy with his work _ until the
morning after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Then the grumbling began, with a number of governors, members of
Congress and state party officials openly suggesting that a change
in command might be a good idea. And the grumbling continues,
though no challenger has stepped forward, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson acknowledges the need for some changes in course. But
he says his fund-raising abilities and his long experience in party
matters merit his remaining at the helm. And he says he will fight
to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Florida Republican Party, Tom Slade, said
the other day that he would like to be national chairman but had no
plans to challenge Nicholson and precipitate in an intraparty
``knife fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Slade added: ``He will either survive or not. If there
is a need for a replacement and the consensus is that I would be
best qualified, I would thoroughly enjoy the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michigan's Republican national committeeman, Chuck
Yob, said he would not challenge Nicholson ``if he's going to make
it.'' But Yob said that because there was growing sentiment for a
change in leadership, ``Jim could get caught up in the scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican state chairman, Mike Francis of Louisiana,
called outright for change at the top of the party. But he too
pulled up short of issuing a challenge, saying as long as Nicholson
has the solid support of the committee he, like Slade and Yob, will
continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can solidify his position, fine,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Nicholson has spent most of the last 10
days trying to do. Aides say he has been on the phone almost
constantly, lobbying and consulting with the members of the RNC who
are scheduled to vote at their January meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: Over on the Democratic side, where the party
chairman is another Coloradan, Gov. Roy Romer, there is no talk of
leadership change, only of having at the Republicans again in 2000.

   California Scrambles After Measure Fails
</P>
<P>
   Ever since California voters defeated an obscure ballot measure
called Proposition 3 on Election Day, the state's election
officials and party leaders have had an almost panicky look about
them. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Under rules established by the Democratic and Republican
national parties, delegates to presidential nominating conventions
must be chosen in closed primaries and caucuses _ that is,
primaries and caucuses in which Democrats vote only for Democrats,
and Republicans vote only for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party will seat delegates chosen in open primaries or
caucuses, in which Democrats can vote for Republicans and
Republicans, likewise, can vote for Democrats. Such voting skews
the political process, the parties say.
</P>
<P>
   But California switched from a closed primary system to an open
system a couple of years ago, contending that the open system would
be, well, more open.
</P>
<P>
   Both national parties immediately sent word that the most
politically powerful state risked having no say in the nominating
process in 2000, unless it backtracked.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the parties warned that the California primary, whose
date had been advanced on the primary calendar to give the state an
earlier and more meaningful say in the process, would end up being
a meaningless beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. The state forthwith came up with Proposition 3. It
proposed going back to the closed primary system for choosing
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But voters turned the measure down, mainly because they did not
understand its intricacies, political experts say. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   California's secretary of state, Bill Jones, thinks he has a
solution that will satisfy both state law and party rules.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be handed special ballots encoded to account for
party affiliation. But voters nevertheless will be allowed to vote
any way they please, either by party (closed) or by crossing over
(open). However, because of the coding, the tabulating machines
will be able to keep a running count of both crossover and by-party
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Results will be forwarded to the national parties. They can then
do with them whatever their rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters would still have the option of casting their ballot for
a presidential candidate regardless of party affiliation,'' Jones
said, ``but the crossover votes might not be recognized by the
political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   A Candidate Keeps His Divorce Quiet
</P>
<P>
   It was a campaign tightly focused on the great political theme
of the year, personal conduct, a campaign with props that included
one of those happy-couple pictures, talk of kids in college,
promises of ``honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But court papers, discovered after Nov. 3 by The Seattle Times,
tell a different tale. They say that the candidate, Brian Baird, a
Democrat seeking the House seat in Washington's 3rd Congressional
District, was not a happily married family man. Instead, it turns
out, he was caught up in divorce proceedings, having separated from
his wife, Mary, in September, midway through the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As she tells it, he first asked for a divorce back in April but
said not to tell because divorce was still politically sensitive
with some voters, an issue that could be a deciding factor in a
tight race. She told The Times that she told him she did not want
the divorce but if their six-year marriage was to end, the public
should not be misled by pictures of a couple holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you should be honest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she went along with the secret, though she says she
stopped going to campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   Baird won his election, defeating his Republican opponent, state
Sen. Don Benton, with 54 percent of the vote. The final divorce
papers were signed two days later.
</P>
<P>
   His response to all this, through an aide:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides to every story. That's all I have to
say.''

EDITORIAL: A FRESH LOOK AT CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years after Fidel Castro came to power and a decade
after the end of the Cold War, a reconsideration of U.S. policy
toward Cuba is overdue. President Clinton was recently given a
surprising and irresistible invitation to do exactly that. It came
from a bipartisan group of senators and an impressive roster of
former Republican national security officials. He should respond
promptly and positively.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Washington has prohibited Americans from
trading with Cuba, investing in its economy and traveling there as
ordinary tourists. In recent years, Washington has irritated U.S.
allies by trying to punish their commerce with Cuba as well. None
of this has noticeably diminished Castro's autocratic rule or
advanced U.S. interests. Arguments justifying the embargo on the
basis of Castro's close military cooperation with the Soviet Union
became obsolete a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should end its embargo at the earliest
possible date and move toward normal diplomatic relations.
Increasing the presence of American diplomats, business people and
tourists on the island will make it easier to promote desperately
needed democratic change. But the 1996 Helms-Burton law makes it
impossible to substantially ease the embargo without congressional
approval. Any significant change in Cuba policy must include
Congress as well.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, including Republican conservatives like Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania, Rod Grams of Minnesota, Mike Enzi of
Wyoming and Pat Roberts of Kansas, do not endorse specific new
policies. Instead, they urge Clinton to appoint a national
commission to seek a new consensus. They recommend that it include
foreign-policy and human-rights specialists, Cuban-Americans,
business representatives and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the views of Cubans in this country have become less
monolithic. Opposition to Castro remains strong. But some younger
Cuban-Americans question whether isolation is the best way to
encourage democratic change. The presence of human rights leaders
would assure that the concerns of Cuban political prisoners and
opposition leaders are not overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   With Castro past 70 and in uncertain health, Cubans have begun
to look toward the political future. The United States should be
trying to influence their debates constructively, not isolating
itself on the sidelines.

WAITING FOR SPEAKER LIVINGSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 15:
</P>
<P>
   With the accession of Robert Livingston as the next House
speaker, Republicans have proclaimed a new order in Washington. But
so far Livingston remains trapped in the old issues, unwilling to
assert himself. He says he wants to settle the possible impeachment
of President Clinton this year, but he is standing by while
Judiciary Committee Republicans squabble with Democrats and among
themselves over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of exerting his leadership and defining how it will
differ from Newt Gingrich's, Livingston needs to help guide the
Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Henry Hyde, in finding a way
through the impeachment crisis. He can then clear the way for a
pragmatic Republican approach on Social Security, health care and
issues the public cares more about.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Livingston
earned a reputation as a tough partisan who knew how and when to
make a deal. Those skills are needed now that sentiment in the
House is running against impeachment and counter to the
determination of Hyde and the Judiciary panel Republicans to push
ahead with a vote to impeach. Averting a showdown is the best path
to a bipartisan agreement on the alternative of censuring Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is clearly waiting until his own formal election as
Republican leader this Wednesday and for the results of the other
leadership contests dividing his party. But he cannot wait much
longer before addressing this issue, which could embroil the
Congress for months. This will be a trend-setting test of
Livingston's abilities. He gained support for the speaker's job by
tapping resentment over Gingrich's penchant for trampling on the
autonomy of House committees and their chairmen. He therefore
cannot run over Hyde, who is looking grumpier by the day. But
effective House speakers learn to guide without dictating.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee enters a critical phase on Thursday when
it hears from Independent counsel Kenneth Starr and faces partisan
struggles over Starr's tactics and whether to call other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston cannot pretend that he has no influence over the tone
and direction that his party members and their chairman take, but
must find a way to guide them with a subtle, respectful hand. Hyde,
for example, needs to be encouraged to lean on Starr to deliver any
and all additional information, like the Kathleen Willey material
sent to the committee Friday. Starr's office cites the Friday
indictment of Webster Hubbell on Whitewater charges as a sign that
it is moving aggressively in wrapping up its investigations. With
settlement of the Paula Jones case adding to the momentum, the
House Judiciary Committee needs to get into the flow and expedite
its proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If the evidence does not change dramatically, a negotiated
conclusion on impeachment would strengthen the Republicans' hand
and create the right climate for a productive Congress. Although
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said testily that he would not
work with the administration on a Social Security compromise,
Livingston surely knows better. The public favors using budget
surpluses to save Social Security, as the White House proposes,
while Republicans are promising to come back with more proposals
for tax cuts. A bipartisan agreement on the safety-net programs
would have an added advantage for Republicans, removing a losing
issue in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   There are many issues for which broad bipartisan agreement
exists. Campaign finance reform, aid to education and protections
for patients in managed care are among the top priorities of the
next Congress. Livingston may recognize better than Gingrich did
that if he cannot reach agreement with the Democrats, the Democrats
will forge agreements with enough moderate Republicans to pass
their own proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business is impeachment. There is an old
saying in politics that you have only one chance to make a first
impression. The public and the members of Congress are waiting for
Livingston to tell them who he is.

 &HT;    Austin will retain 512 area code
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Public Utility Commission agreed Friday to a
divorce of the 512 area code and, despite the pleas of Corpus
Christi, Austin got the kid _ the 512 number. The mother usually
does, especially when mother's family includes state government.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi's business leaders had campaigned to keep the 512
number because changing it, they said, would hurt its crucial
tourist industry, while Austin's more robust economy could better
afford the cost of conversion.
</P>
<P>
   And they got their hopes up when Pat Wood, the commission
chairman, warned that no one should take his vote for granted,
despite widespread assumptions the commission would never
antagonize state lawmakers by making all of state government change
its area code.
</P>
<P>
   Wood floated the idea of leaving the 512 area intact
geographically and overlaying a second number, perhaps only in the
northern half of the area, which includes Austin. Such an approach
would have required tapping out at least 10 digits for each phone
call, even local ones, as Houston and Dallas are about to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood reluctantly decided Friday that for now it wouldn't be
practical to use two area codes because new phone numbers are
needed too soon: ``It's difficult to argue with the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wood said that his decision was not tied to the fact
that state government is based in Austin. But the last time the 512
area code was split, in 1992, it was Austin that kept the number
while the bigger city, San Antonio, got the new one (210).
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Judy Walsh repeated Friday what she had said
before, that ``the only practical answer is a split.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wood and Walsh agreed to the split, with Corpus Christi and
South Central Texas to get a new area code number to be announced
in about a month. Commissioner Patricia Curran wasn't present
because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years, people calling Austin and Central Texas
will still dial 512. And those already here won't have to tap out
10 digits on the phone to make a local call.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy it while you can, because the next time 512 runs out of
telephone numbers, Austin likely will get a second area code
number, not another split.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Friday that well before 512 starts to run
out of numbers, it intends to use a limited overlay for the Austin
metropolitan area. That approach would spare Central Texas
customers outside of Austin from going to 10-digit dialing for
local calls, but not those inside the metro area.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Adair, a Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. official who
specializes in area codes, said 512 is expected to have enough
numbers to last until 2004. The commission said the industry should
start studying for a second Austin area code within two years of
this split, which will take effect next September.

 &HT;    Questions on Blue Cross merger remain
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Department of Insurance approved the
acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas by its Illinois
counterpart on Friday but without a full public accounting of how
much money was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Still pending in Texas courts is the issue of whether Texas Blue
Cross is a charity and, as such, must contribute $350 million, plus
interest, to be paid over a 20-year period to the State of Texas as
a consequence of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Texas company had agreed to contribute $350
million as a partial settlement if Texas courts determine it
acquired its value as a charitable entity. The Texas attorney
general is required by law to protect the charitable assets of a
nonprofit insurer in the event of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union on Friday lashed out at Attorney General Dan
Morales' agreement to keep the full value of the Texas Blue Cross
secret. The consumers advocate argues the assets of Texas Blue
Cross appear to be considerably more than $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Blue Cross acknowledges annual revenue of $2.6 billion and
surplus reserves of $276 million as the largest nonprofit health
coverage company in the state. The Texas company provides coverage
for more than 1.9 million customers and serves more than 3.5
million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois company, the largest health insurance company in
the state, has 2.9 million members.
</P>
<P>
   In sealing the report on the valuation of Texas Blue Cross'
assets, Morales relied on an exception to the Texas Public
Information Act that is ``designed to stop a 'run on the bank' and
is using it to deny public access to a wide variety of insurance
department records,'' including the value of assets of Texas Blue
Cross, said Reggie James, director of the southwest regional office
of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Morales spokesman Ron Dusek said the open records decision
``speaks for itself, and it addresses the law. There is nothing
additional that we can add to what it says about the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies now await final approval from the Illinois
Department of Insurance.

 &HT;    Batman's cousin draws on memories
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Judy Godin's cousin Bob gave her
gifts, she made darned sure he signed them.
</P>
<P>
   Bob, you see, was Bob Kane, creator and illustrator of the famed
Batman comics. And he often doodled Batman and Robin characters for
her on whatever was handy; postcards, scratch paper, sketch pads.
</P>
<P>
   Godin kept them all, of course, along with press clippings and
some old, autographed ``galley proofs'' of comic book pages.
</P>
<P>
   When Kane died at 83 last week, Godin realized her rare cartoon
art _ some of it framed on the walls of her south Palm Beach County
suburban home _ would only get rarer. That's why, like the Batcave,
she wants her address kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Godin picked through a stack of sketches this week, recalling
some unusual encounters with Kane and his characters, who first
appeared in DC Comics in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time in the 1940s when Godin and her family met
Kane at a restaurant in her hometown of Worcester, Mass. The
cousin, 20 years older than she, plunked down a hotel postcard and
_ Pow! Zowie! _ sketched out the Dynamic Duo for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He closed his eyes once and just drew this Batman and Robin,''
she recalled, showing a sketch of the chiseled-face hero and the
cherubic Boy Wonder. ``He drew a profile of Batman, and the
interesting thing was, it was all one line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Batman Kane created as a teenager was more vampire-like than
the ultra-square sleuth portrayed on the 1960s TV series. Kane
wasn't exactly warm and fuzzy himself, Godin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very into Bob Kane,'' she said. ``He was not quick with
a buck ... but he was very nice to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled going with him to an old, narrow storage building
in New York and riding up a freight elevator. There, in a dim,
nondescript storage stall stood two painted figures, a lifesize
Batman and Robin, and a stash of memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Godin doesn't have any of Kane's early comic book art. But
neither did Kane; his ex-wife chucked his leather-bound originals
into the trash sometime in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Rarest of Godin's sketches, she guesses, is a quickie drawing of
villains Penguin and The Joker.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked Bob to do the bad guys,'' she said. ``All
they wanted was Batman and Robin.

 &HT;    Environmentally attuned houses avoid reliance on air
conditioning
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What makes a Texas house cool?
</P>
<P>
   If the homes on the recent Texas Cool House Tour '98 are any
indication, it has less to do with a big air-conditioning system
than it does with the things that make a house environmentally
sound. Within the walls, on the roofs and in the yards of these
houses are some cutting-edge ``green'' technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The self-guided tour, on Nov. 1, was sponsored by the Texas
Solar Energy Society and the City of Austin Green Building Program.
Across Texas, 22 homes were opened to the public _ 14 in the Austin
area area _ to show off a dizzying variety of energy-efficient and
environmentally friendly approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we learned on the tour:
</P>
<P>
   1. Not only can you use solar cells to generate electricity for
your home, but you can also sell your excess electricity back to
the utility company. To do this, you'll need a rather pricey
photovoltaic system, though.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stained concrete floors are popular in many sustainable, or
``green,'' homes. The mass of concrete helps keep a home cool in
the summer and warm in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Exterior and interior walls can be made from a lot more than
just plain stucco or cinder blocks. For example, you could use:
wood chips and concrete (FasWall), old coffee cups and Portland
cement blocks (Rastra), aerated concrete (Hebel), sheathing
material and foam (SIP) or straw bale in-fill. Each, we're told, is
fire resistant and energy efficient.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can block heat and keep your attic cooler by using a roof
radiant barrier _ a layer of metallic foil placed on the back of
the roof decking or attached to the rafters just below the roof to
reflect heat back out of the attic.
</P>
<P>
   5. Passive solar design is a fancy name for building a house
that stays cool in summer and warm in winter without a lot of
mechanical equipment. It usually translates into roof overhangs
over porches and windows and cross-ventilation from windows. It can
also mean how a house is placed on a site to minimize sunny
exposures.
</P>
<P>
   6. If your house gets warm from solar heat coming through the in
from all your windows, think about low-emissivity (Low-E) glass,
which has . ``Low-emissivity'' is the quality of a heat-reducing
coating baked into it.
</P>
<P>
   7. Does poor-quality indoor air make you sneeze? Give you
headaches? Cause breathing problems? You might want to leave your
walls in their natural state, or paint them with no-VOC (that
stands for volatile organic compounds) paint, which is paint
without the fumes.
</P>
<P>
   8. If you're building a home, try to leave the trees and
vegetation as like they were before you got there. Short of that,
Xeriscape with native plants that require little water, such as
salvia or lantana.
</P>
<P>
   9. Don't just watch the rain pour off your roof. A green home
saves water with rainwater harvesting systems, low-flow fixtures
and high- efficiency appliances such as front-loading washing
machines. 10. Worried about termites? Use There are nontoxic
controls such as sand barriers and metal shields, which are
installed during construction.

 &HT;    Resistance training will give strength to regular routine
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Regular running has kept Holly Hailey lean and lithe,
looking more like 25 instead of the 35 she really is.
</P>
<P>
   But cardiovascular exercise alone hasn't _ and won't _ give her
the toned arms and shoulders she'd like to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally I try to do some push-ups and use free weights,
but not as often as I would like,'' said Hailey, a stay-at-home mom
with two young boys.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire a more sculpted look, Hailey should begin regular
strength training supplemented by regular stretching, says Meri van
Houten, co-owner of the Training Zone in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing solely on the upper body, however, van
Houten recommends a general resistance program that will increase
Hailey's overall musculature.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's toned and thin, but she's a petite person and fair,''
van Houten said. ``Many women who are small, petite and fair have
to worry about osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis is a progressive decrease in bone density that
weakens bones and makes them more likely to fracture. Eating
calcium-rich foods and taking calcium supplements can help stave
off this disease, which usually strikes older women. But resistance
exercises also are important, since they build bone density.
</P>
<P>
   Another major benefit from resistance training is a faster
metabolism. Lean muscle burns more energy than fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 35, we lose 5 percent of muscle mass every five years,''
van Houten added, in warning. Resistance training can reverse that
loss.
</P>
<P>
   For Hailey, van Houten suggests beginning with total body
strength training twice a week, using a combination of free
weights, resistance bands and weight machines. This would be in
addition to Hailey's cardiovascular routine, which includes
running, Spinning or treadmill work five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter which tools she uses, as long as Holly uses
correct form and technique,'' van Houten emphasized. ``Even the way
you grip the weights is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Good exercises for Hailey would be push-ups; bicep curls;
reverse dips, using a chair or bench; alternating front raises; and
modified bent-over rows, van Houten said.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks, Hailey may modify this program to focus on her
upper body once a week and her lower body once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more strength and definition in the lower body will
give her more endurance for running,'' van Houten said. ``And the
stronger you are, the less likely you are to be injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The workouts shouldn't be on consecutive days, to allow muscles
recovery time, and should be accompanied by stretching _ a vital
part of exercise that many people neglect, van Houten said.

 &HT;    Off the beaten path in San Antonio
 &HT;    By Hector Saladana
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You could visit San Antonio's Riverwalk and be
assured of a good time _ margaritas, boat watching and dinner at
Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock Cafe. But why not take a look in the
alternative guidebook? While the rest of the world is canal-bound,
you could be hearing original conjunto, sampling a martini or
heading out for honky-tonk just outside of town. San Antonions
covet these out-of-the-way places, many of which have changed
little in decades and are now being rediscovered by a new
generation. What follows is a list of 10 of San Antonio's
less-conspicuous entertainment gems.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring '20s, a gaudy, 72-year-old, honest-to-gosh speakeasy
and gambling den from the days of Al Capone, has recently become
rockabilly and swing central. Touring retro acts such as ``Surf
King'' Dick Dale, Deke Dickerson &AMP; the Fabulous Ecco-Fonics and Hot
Rod Lincoln have made this place legit with the greasers, punks and
the jump-jivin' Gap set. At 13445 Old Blanco Road, (210) 492-1353.
</P>
<P>
   Taco Land owner Ram Ayala has never met a stranger, though some
patrons who frequent his tiny, legendary punk and alternative rock
hangout are definitely stranger than others. Cheap beer, loud
music, a much-maligned jukebox and an outdoor patio make this a
must-stop on your Alamo Town late-night music itinerary. At 103 W.
Grayson St., (210) 223-8406.
</P>
<P>
   Buff college kids, fast-talking hipsters and the Viagra
comb-over set converge at Martini's, which serves up Las
Vegas-style lounge entertainment Thursdays- through Saturdays with
the sensational Wayne Harper, _ San Antonio's answer to Wayne
Newton, only better. Only a small door plaque marks the entrance,
so the oxblood decor, low lighting and tinsel stage curtain let you
know you've arrived. Never a cover at one of the best-kept secrets
in town. At 8507 McCullough, (210) 344-4747.
</P>
<P>
   The neon hues of Salute on the St. Mary's Strip gently
illuminate the stage that regularly plays home to conjunto and
Tex-Mex heroes such as Steve Jordan, Nick Villareal, Flaco Jimenez,
Augie Meyers, Rocky Morales, Frank Rodarte and Louis Bustos. Sunday
night jams are in-your-face joys. At 2801 N. St. Mary's St., (210)
732-5307.
</P>
<P>
   The Floore Country Store still hangs a sign out front
advertising ``Willie Nelson Every Sat. Nite.'' Located a buckshot
blast off Texas 16 in Helotes, the historic honky tonk is still the
best place to cry in your beer 'round these parts, and, yes, Willie
and the boys, and some of the best that country music has to offer,
do the twang thang on the outdoor stage. At 14464 Old Bandera Road,
(210) 695-8827.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mission Drive-In Theater is closed for the
fall and winter seasons, but come late spring the last of the local
outdoor movie theaters will be showing first-run movies for $8 a
carload. Load up the ice chest, snacks and lawn chairs and round up
a few friends for ``Deep Impact'' and ``Scream'' sequels. Nestled
in the shadow of Mission San Jose on the city's South Side, the
drive-in benefits from breezes nightly. Weekdays are best. At 3100
Roosevelt, (210) 532-3259.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians seem to gravitate to Eugene Ng's Krazy Kat Music.
Elephants have their graveyards, and apparently so do rare vintage
guitars, recording studio gear, keyboards and tube amplifiers. A
great place to just hang out, jam or chew the fat over the finer
points of why a Fender is better than Framus. At 3020 N. St. Mary's
St., (210) 737-0523.
</P>
<P>
   Where can you experience cutting-edge turntablism, rave and
house party music? Wong's Art Bar in St. Paul's Square, of course.
Wong's giant loft is the center of the hip-hop universe and all
that is eclectic and cool. This electronic dance factory and
restaurant goes into the wee, wee hours. At 1203 E. Commerce St.,
(210) 475-0771.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a baile going on at Lerma's, one of San Antonio's
most popular old-fashioned West Side haunts. Here you'll find live
norten(tilde)o music on any given weekend by authentic heavyweights
Santiago Jimenez Jr., Bene Medina, Henry Zimmerle or Los Coyotes
Del Norte. Real musical barrio comfort food. 1602 N. Zarzamora.
(210) 732-0477.
</P>
<P>
   No visit to San Antone can be truly complete without a lunch or
dinner visit to old-time favorite the Tip Top Cafe. Bring an
appetite because when the blue-hair waitresses set down the
generous portions, you'll need it _ and be warned, you'll have to
loosen your belt a notch or two after you've cleaned the plate. At
2814 Fredricksburg Road,d. (210) 732-0191.

 &HT;    San Antonio's Mission Trail sweeps visitors into thrall of Texas
history
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The further one drives along the Mission Trail,
the faster the centuries seem to peel away. As the urban trail of
streets and roads winds 12 miles from the Alamo _ the first and
oldest San Antonio mission, founded in 1718 as Mission San Antonio
de Valero at its first site along the river _ to the southern
outpost of Mission Espada, the pilgrimage offers transport to an
era so far removed from our own that it seems like another culture,
another country.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the walls of the missions, the years have taken their
toll: Tthe Mission Outdoor Theater in the field behind the
expansive Mission San Jose has seen its day and gone to seed, while
even the comparatively thriving Mission Auto Parts looks like a
relic of a recent past. Time, it seems, moves more quickly beyond
the hushed stillness of the mission chapels, the historical sweep
of their surrounding grounds. Even for someone who isn't
conventionally religious or nominally Catholic, there's a
contemplative balm within these confines that makes even the sound
of the trucks that rumble along the surrounding commercial strips
seem meditative. You can lose yourself in the missions. And you can
find yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four beautiful missions in a string along the San
Antonio River are among the oldest and most important structures in
the United States,'' asserts ``The Smithsonian Guide to Historic
America,'' distinguishing the missions that remain houses of
worship along the river from the one that moved to what is now
downtown to become ``the cradle of Texas liberty.'' The rugged
grandeur of these missions stands in stark contrast to the
neighborhoods that surround them, trailer parks and graffiti-tagged
garages far south of the city's beaten paths of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the missions remain the crucible of San Antonio _ steeped
in the strains of Spanish, Mexican and Native American culture. The
missions that have been preserved are so indigenously San Antonian
that these churches and compounds might well be the vertebrae of
the city's backbone. To spend a day on the trail from mission to
mission is to experience the essence of a city, to come to terms
with truths far removed from the distracting dazzle of the
Riverwalk.
</P>
<P>
   For a visitor from Austin, such a pilgrimage also provides some
answers to the riddle of how a city in such close proximity to our
own can be so far removed in terms of tradition, history and
spirit. Inside the missions, Austin seems at such a cultural
distance that it might as well be Boulder, Colo., or Marin County,
Calif. The great promise of Austin is that it is perennially a
college kid, always trying to decide what it wants to be when it
grows up. The great legacy of San Antonio is that its past pervades
its present, as the heart of the city remains recognizably what it
was when the missions stamped their imprint on these lands. Blink
your eyes in Austin, and it can seem that everything has changed.
Close your eyes in San Antonio, and it can seem that nothing
essential has ever changed.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the uniqueness of San Antonio, the missions are
linked and preserved as a National Park like no other. Granted
exemption from the separation of church and state for the sake of
historical preservation, the missions are maintained by the
National Park Service while offering religious services under the
auspices of the Archdiocese of San Antonio. As sanctuaries of
worship, the flickering candles and blooming flowers within the
chapels attest to a living faith that sustains itself amid the
centuries of tradition to which the ravages of the walls attest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the historical side of the story is equally important, for
the very existence of the missions reflects the imposition of a
foreign culture upon the indigenous culture of that was indigenous
to the region. The Franciscan friars who established the missions
in the early 1700s promised the native Coahuiltecan tribes safety
in this world from Apache or Comanche attack and the salvation of
everlasting life in the world to come.
</P>
<P>
   All that the Coahuiltecans needed to do in return was renounce
their native language, culture, morality, spirituality and almost
every other tenet by which they had previously existed, in order to
provide the slave labor to construct the compound in which they
would live. It was a deal that many of the Coahuiltecans did
everything they could to refuse _ despite the coercive punishments
of the Spanish _ and it was the failure of the missions to sustain
a growing community of converts that soon spelled the end of their
era. One can't completely appreciate the beauty of the missions
without acknowledging the stain of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The mission era of San Antonio extended through the 18th
century, having begun barely 200 years after the voyage of
Christopher Columbus. In its attempt to expand the reach and
influence of ``New Spain,'' and in land-grab competition with
England and France, the Spanish government hoped to establish
religious outposts in the wilderness for the purpose of asserting
and reinforcing their claims to the territory. Since Spain lacked
the settlers to inhabit the region, the indoctrination of natives
into the Spanish culture was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the European cultural/religious legacies of Spain and
the colorful creativity of Mexican artisans with local material and
indigenous labor, the missions were a uniquely Southwestern hybrid
in style, form and function. They were communities rather than
merely churches, growing their own food and sustaining their
self-sufficient economies within the walls built to provide
protection from hostile encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   More than two centuries later, they stand as a testament to a
period of tumultuous transition, through which profound (and
violent) transformations in the population and personality of the
region would cast a character that endures to this day. Borders
changed, different flags flew, yet a continuity of culture _ a
Catholic culture, a Mexican culture, a Texan culture, ultimately an
American culture _ persisted through the political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, secular settlement that came to surround what had
previously been wilderness outposts _ combined with the inability
of the missions to sustain a growing community of converts within
the walls _ brought the mission era in San Antonio to an end by the
beginning of the 1800s. In short order, the new century saw Mexico
rebelling against Spanish rule and Texas declaring its independence
from Mexico, throwing the entire territory up for grabs. When the
dust settled, those San Antonio missions other than the Alamo
became Catholic churches under the Republic of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ravaged by battle and beset by deterioration, the churches
subsequently suffered almost a century of neglect, lacking the
resources for restoration. Though the San Antonio Conservation
Society mounted a preliminary campaign in the 1920s, it wasn't
until the '30s that the initiative to preserve the missions for
posterity became a national public works priority.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Concepcion, the first northern stop on the trail, has
experienced the least damage to its chapel, and remains the oldest
unrestored stone Catholic church in the United States, though the
compound surrounding it is long gone. The next stop south is the
``Queen of the Missions,'' the Mission San Jose, which represents
the most ambitious restoration project and gives the most complete
impression of what everyday life in the mission community must have
been like. This is the mission to visit for those who can only make
time to visit one.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Mission San Juan has an almost spooky
spirituality to it, its cozy chapel all but alive with religious
mystery. My recent visit in the wake of the Day of the Dead found a
tape of Peruvian flute music serenading a lifelike statue of a
wounded Christ at the foot of the altar, his head on a pillow,
beneath dozens of lit candles. On the walls of the sanctuary, a
portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe is draped by Mexican and
American flags. (A woman was starting to enter just as I was
leaving, and my presence scared her half to death.)
</P>
<P>
   Farthest south is Mission Espada, with its three-belled tower
one of the more photographed images of the missions. It is
currently undergoing some construction in its roadway, and its
chapel has been closed since a fire last January. The church hopes
to resume services before Christmas. The parkland road of the
Mission Trail that leads there seems increasingly out in the
country, with dogs running free, making Mission Espada appear all
the more like an agrarian outpost, a place beyond time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's a bit of a cultural shock after a day on the Mission
Trail to realize that one is actually so close to Loop 410, rushing
traffic and the return to Austin.

 &HT;    Rested Raiders' defense lies in wait
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ The schedule very clearly states that Texas is
playing Texas Tech today, but given the relative success of Texas'
last opponent, some might expect to see a team that looks a lot
like Oklahoma State when they get to Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns insist that is not the case. They aren't expecting
the Red Raiders to emulate the Cowboys' defensive tactics, even
though Oklahoma State almost forced overtime before falling 37-34
to Texas at Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Texas rolled up 489 yards _ the sixth time in this 7-2
season that the Longhorns have exceeded 400 yards _ and passed for
a school-record 408 yards. Secondly, Texas Tech (6-3) ranks 12th
nationally on defense and 17th against the run and hasn't given up
more than 381 total yards in a game all season.
</P>
<P>
   Tech is good without gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're three plays away from being one of the top five teams in
the nation,'' Tech offensive tackle Jonathan Gray said. ``We're 11
points away from being undefeated. We started out like a shot of
lightning. I mean, we were the team of the '90s. These last two
games will be the final say-so if we go to a bowl, and we don't
want to be home at grandma's house over the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray may be confusing Tech with Florida State or Nebraska, but
the Red Raiders have held three opponents under 78 yards rushing
and have never surrendered more than 195 yards on the ground in a
game. That means Texas' Ricky Williams' chances of getting the 204
yards he needs to surpass Tony Dorsett's Division I-A career
rushing mark might be remote. However, Missouri's Devin West ran
for 133 yards in an offense much less potent than Texas'.
</P>
<P>
   In nine games, Tech has allowed only six rushing plays that have
gone for more than 15 yards. Three were quarterback scrambles, two
came on option plays and one was a sweep by Colorado. Major
Applewhite rarely scrambles, and Texas hasn't run the option since
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me they're very good against the run,'' Texas
offensive coordinator Greg Davis said. ``Their staff has been
together a long time. They've played good defense a long time, and
they believe in what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Red Raiders do is play fairly straight-up defense
with a heavy emphasis on stopping the run, using eight defenders
near the line of scrimmage and controlling the pass with
man-for-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Oklahoma State, which put nine men in the box and blitzed
its pants off, Texas Tech has blitzed only 60 times (17.4 percent)
although it does a lot of ``greendogging,'' which Davis says looks
like a blitz. In that scheme, a linebacker responsible for Williams
comes hard when he stays in to block. Davis says Texas'
quarterback-tailback-dominated offense makes it easier to get
Williams his normal carries and figures Tech's basic defensive set
should allow Texas a better pass-run balance than last week, when
the Longhorns threw the ball 41 times and ran it 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders also move their strong safety, or rover, near
the line but leave their free safety in the middle of the field to
contain the deep post routes. Their corners are good but are left
exposed on an island, making Applewhite salivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to sell out against the run,'' said
Applewhite, who has thrown for 12 touchdowns in his last six games.
``They might feel that (the passing record) was a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech had a week off, which should improve its defense's
quick recognition of UT formations. But Texas has done an admirable
job of not tipping off its plays. Last week's TD pass to Williams
came on a play the Horns have called almost two dozen times this
year but started from a different formation to confuse Oklahoma
State. That's typical of a Longhorns team that is on a roll and
will continue to roll in a 27-24 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of our team is we should win ballgames,''
Applewhite said. ``Before, it was, 'Are we going to win?' After the
Kansas State game, we just got off our butts and won games. It was
disrespectful to our coaching staff to play like we did the first
few games. Now, what we've worked for all year is in Lubbock. I've
never been there, but I've heard there's not much there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a defense there, for one thing. And it's very flat
there, Major, but don't expect the Red Raiders to be.

 &HT;    Nickelodeon rules!
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 15
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Walk into Christine O'Shea's Lake Worth
house on any weeknight around 7:30 and you will witness a battle
familiar to many American parents.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner are O'Shea's two children, primed for their
before-bed scrubdown. In the other corner is the family television,
tuned as always to Nickelodeon, the almighty cable network for
kids. Caught in the middle is O'Shea, a working parent trying to
keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea's deal is this: The kids can watch 15 minutes of Rugrats,
Nickelodeon's most popular program, before or after they step into
the shower. But the kids want the whole half-hour of Tommy Pickles
and his diaper-clad cohorts. And nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking tears and the whole business,'' says an
exasperated O'Shea. ``It's either `I've never seen it before' or
`It's my favorite.'''
</P>
<P>
   Everything Nickelodeon does these days seems to be a favorite
with kids. According to Nielsen Media Research, it has 13 of the
top 20 TV programs for children ages 2-11. And although
Nickelodeon's audience is limited to cable subscribers, it
routinely beats the big network competitors when it comes to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Disneyesque fashion, Nickelodeon is getting ready to
move beyond TV and conquer all. There's already a Nickelodeon
magazine, Web site and theme park-within-a-theme park (at Orlando's
Universal Studios). There's also a spinoff cable channel in the
works, called Noggin, which is being launched in partnership with
the Children's Television Workshop, creators of Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   And with this Friday's release of the Rugrats movie, the network
makes its big cinematic splash. There have been two previous
Nickelodeon films _ Harriet the Spy in 1996 and Goodburger in 1997.
But they don't compare to Rugrats, which comes with a $100mil-lion
promotional budget, a soundtrack featuring Lisa Loeb, Busta Rhymes,
Beck, Elvis Costello, Jakob Dylan, No Doubt and the B-52's and a
product line of Mattel toys.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, is Nickelodeon primed to take over the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, our intention is not to take over the world but to
prepare kids to take over the world,'' says Nickelodeon general
manager Cyma Zarghami, a fixture at the 19-year-old network since
1985. ``We are bigger than television ... we're a lifestyle. And
because we are really tuned into what's going on in kids' lives,
we're able to translate that into other mediums.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Cult of Nickelodeon. While individual programs have
put it atop the Nielsen ratings, a kids-first sensibility has given
the network its true appeal _ and allowed it to spread beyond
television.
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude reflected in everything Nickelodeon does, from
on-air surveys to see what kids are wearing for Halloween to a
special on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal that translated the
president's peccadilloes into carefully worded terms any k'' as
it's called), and Nick News, a Sunday night newsmagazine hosted by
Linda Ellerbee.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, Nickelodeon's big standout has been
its daytime ``Nick Jr.'' lineup. The educational program Blue's
Clues has eclipsed PBS' Sesame Street and Barney as the favorite
among preschoolers. With a congenial host leading the way, kids are
encouraged to solve various puzzles to improve what Nickelodeon
calls ``flexible thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows away the idea that television is a passive medium,''
says David Kleeman of the Illinois-based American Center for
Children's Television.
</P>
<P>
   With all these shows, there's no single formula. Although
Nickelodeon adheres to certain family-friendly rules _ ``You'll
never see anything with guns on Nickelodeon,'' says one producer _
and tries to be multiculturally diverse, it leaves enormous room
for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're working with people who really want to do creative
things and want to change the mold,'' says Thomas Lynch, producer
of The Journey of Allen Strange, one of the network's recent
additions.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's program is a good example: It's about a human-looking
alien who finds a home on earth with a single-parent family. Lynch
wanted to illustrate how all children feel ``alienated'' at times.
Nickelodeon bought the concept; he's not so sure a broadcast
network would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put kids first in all of their thinking,'' he says of
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any cult, Nickelodeon's appeal could come with a
price. Children's advocates fear that kids are watching more TV and
not engaging in important activities such as sports and reading.
``They watch Nick like you or I might watch ER or Home
Improvement,'' says Karen Ciraulo of the California Reading
Association, a teachers' group. The difference is that ER and Home
Improvement only last 30 minutes or an hour; Nickelodeon never
ends. It's a far cry from the days when all kids could watch after
school were Flintstones reruns.
</P>
<P>
   And because parents generally perceive it as a quality,
violence-free product, they may indulge their kids' viewing habits.
Many boast of watching Rugrats alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is that with each new offering _ the network
recently expanded its lineup into the 8-9 p.m. hour with its
``Nickel-O-Zone'' slate of shows _ the TV stays on longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one show after the other,'' moans O'Shea, the Lake
Worth mother who struggles to get her kids into the shower. ``Then
when they do a Rugrats marathon, you're a goner. They're never
going to go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike PBS, Nickelodeon is a commercial network, which means
it exists to make a profit. (And some profit it is: This year, the
network is expected to rake in $397 million, up 37 percent from
1997.) In turn, that means parents shouldn't be surprised if their
Christmas shopping lists are longer: Lots of toys are advertised in
those commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to explain that to Heather Lockett, a Palm
Beach Gardens mother of two. She's learned the hard way from her
3-year-old daughter, who regularly tunes into the ``Nick Jr.''
block. ``She can quote commercials to me. That's frightening,''
says Lockett.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon executives point to studies that show TV viewing has
actually decreased among children and note that parents should
monitor _ and limit _ what kids watch. They don't see the network
as posing too much temptation; they see it as offering a greater
array of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman of the American Center for Children's Television agrees.
``For 30 years, people have been fighting for high-quality
children's television and Nick is providing that,'' he says, adding
that it's absurd to criticize them for being good at what they do.
``As adults, we don't blame Ben and Jerry for the fact we're
overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Nickelodeon goes from kid-friendly network to
kid-friendly media conglomerate, there will be more time _ and
money _ to spend. And the battles will go beyond the realm of bath
time. As Lockett puts it, ``Nick is a very tough opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon can't say what's next, other than a $350 million
animation studio it just opened in California. But executives know
they've got a brand with influence and unlimited potential _ and
they want to guide it with care and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to overcommercialize Nickelodeon,'' says Kevin
Kay, senior vice president. ``I think the (Rugrats) movie is
important for us, it's our first animated feature. We believe kids
want that movie ... But I think (the future of Nickelodeon) is
about telling good stories and creating great characters.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, mark your calendars: Rugrats 2 is set to be
released in 2000.

 &HT;    `Sesame Street' marks 30 years of helping kids laugh and learn
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 15
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's the most beloved _ and perhaps best
known _ street in the world. It's a place where kids sing about
sunny days, where everything's A-OK. It exists nowhere, but is seen
practically everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, just about everyone can tell you how to get ... how to get
to ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning children's show, which has entertained and
educated generations of viewers, begins its 30th season on Monday.
Since its 1969 debut (the ``Sesame Street'' concept was actually
born in 1968 with the creation of the Children's Television
Workshop), more than 100million children in over 140 countries have
sung along with Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Elmo. According to
Nielsen Media Research, nearly 10 million people in the U.S. watch
the show each week. The U.S. Department of Education says 77
percent of America's preschoolers watch ``Sesame Street'' once a
week or more.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Sesame Street,'' which has 71 Emmys, does a lot
more than teach kids how to count, add and spell. Children also
learn invaluable life lessons about death, diversity, tolerance,
gender stereotyping, conflict resolution and coping with
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' marked a turning point in television history
``when programming shifted from being an electronic baby sitter to
being an electronic preschool,'' says Michael Criste, a
psychologist for Jefferson Davis and Bear Lakes middle schools in
Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sesame Street'' no longer has an iron-clad grip on that
preschool market. In the last five years, there has been an
explosion of ``Sesame Street'' clones. Leading the way is
Nickelodeon, whose Blue's Clues is the most watched show on TV
among preschoolers _ making it bigger than ``Sesame Street,''
``Barney'' or ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sesame Street'' team says it gladly welcomes all
challengers. ``For 25 years we were the only game in town,'' notes
Michael Loman, ``Sesame Street's'' executive producer. ``But I
think it's a good thing for kids to see more quality shows. And
it's good for us to have the competition, because it spurs us to
make a better `Sesame Street.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' producers may not admit it, but there's no
question the increased competition forced them to make the most
significant changes in the show's storied history. This year you'll
see a new cast member (Alan, the new owner of Mr. Hooper's store
played by Japanese actor Alan Muraoka), a revamped opening and a
new segment called ``Elmo's World.''
</P>
<P>
   Loman says he's most excited about ``Elmo's World.'' In the
self-contained, 15-minute segment, viewers will see the world
through Elmo's eyes and watch his crayon drawings come to life. For
instance, Monday's theme is all about balls. Why do balls bounce?
What happens when you take the air out?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot more younger kids watching the show, kids
as young as 2,'' Loman explains. ``We were looking for an element
to address the needs of the youngest kids that would also be of
interest to 4- and 5-year-olds. We picked Elmo because he's 3 1/2
years old and a great crossover character.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new segments include ``Ernie's Show and Tell,'' ``Monster
Day'' and ``People in the Neighborhood,'' featuring William
Wegman's Weimaraners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' was launched in the turbulent '60s, but
surprisingly, the model for the show was NBC's variety series Rowan
&AMP; Martin's ``Laugh-In.'' At the time, ``Laugh-In'' was considered
fairly revolutionary, with musical numbers and fast-paced comedy
sketches. In fact, if there's a knock against ``Sesame Street,''
it's that the show is often too fast-paced and doesn't give kids
time to absorb what's being taught.
</P>
<P>
   How does ``Sesame Street'' stay interesting after 30 years?
Loman says several staff members (40 year-round and 140 during the
five-month taping season) often visit day care centers in the New
York metropolitan area and observe kids watching the show. Children
are also interviewed and asked specific questions about what they
learned _ or didn't learn.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Loman points out that tests showed the youngest
viewers often lost interest in ``Sesame Street'' when films and
animated shorts were aired. So this year the number of narrative
``Sesame Street'' stories featuring the lovable Muppet characters
will jump from five to eight.
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge ``Sesame Street'' producers face, however, is
keeping the show funny. ``We're a comedy show that teaches,'' says
Arlene Sherman, the show's supervising producer. ``Like any
long-running show, you have to continue to keep it current and
fresh. But what separates us from a long-running sitcom or a
`Saturday Night Live' is that we have a new audience every three to
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Lynch, WXEL's director of creative services, believes it's
not only the humor that has kept ``Sesame Street'' on the air.
Tackling such one-time taboo TV subjects as multiculturalism and
diversity put ``Sesame Street'' on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sesame Street' changed how kids watched TV,'' says Lynch.
``When you go back to shows 30 years ago, how many black people
were on TV? How many Spanish people? There were none. `Sesame
Street' was one of the first shows to show diversity. Then it
showed a deaf girl (librarian Linda), a girl in a wheelchair (real
life wheelchair-bound actress Tarah Lynne Schaffer) and it
reflected a realistic society ... and changed our attitudes about
the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Sesame Street'' survives another 30 years, the show you see
today will not be the one airing in the future. ``We're always
asking, `What can we do better? How can we change something to make
it meet the needs of today's kids?' '' says Loman. ``We've done
that for 30 years, and that's what kept the show from being a
fossil.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's also helped make ``Sesame Street'' one of the world's
most famous, A-OK thoroughfares.

   NOTE TO EDS ABOUT CLINTON ASIA TRIP: President Clinton is
planning to travel to Asia in mid-November to attend the APEC
summit meeting in Malaysia. The itinerary calls for Japan and South
Korea. Here is a budget of the advance package of stories, all of
which have moved in both the International and Commentary
categories:
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-SUMMIT _ KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Shellshocked after more
than a year of Asian economic crisis, many Asians are in a sour
mood as they await this week's visit by President Clinton. Seldom
since the Cold War has a world leader been more publicly
vituperative toward Western financial institutions than the
Malaysian prime minister, who will host Clinton and 20 other Asian
and Pacific leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in his recession-wracked capital Nov. 17-18. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECONOMY _ TOKYO _ The personnel director of a major
Japanese construction company started on his fourth
whiskey-on-the-rocks as he explained his own gloomy role in the
recession that stubbornly blocks Japan's economic engine from
igniting. ``My mission is to do the firing. If I don't do it, I
will be fired,'' said Tomihei Soudou, who was unwinding after a
recent Saturday of work with three colleagues at a shopping complex
restaurant. In 18 years he has fired ``not even 10 people'' at the
company with a payroll of 15,000 workers. In the next three years,
he must get rid of 1,000. Fear over who next will be squeezed out
of Japan's weakened industries, fall victim to the highest surge of
bankruptcies since World War II, or see wages or annual bonuses
trimmed further back is a key reason for the persisting recession.
(Kunstel, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ECONOMY _ BEIJING _ The stalls at the ``Russian market''
are bulging with bright down jackets, fur coats, ski pants, wool
sweaters, hats, muffs and gloves to warm up winter in the Russian
icebox. The only thing lacking are Russian buyers. The sales slump
in the warren of stores and open-air stalls densely packing this
market is one symptom of how the Asian economic contagion has
spread. And it raises questions of whether China still may catch
the malaise. Russia's wide-ranging economic problems produced a
meltdown in August _ the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a
moratorium on foreign credit repayments. In an economic atmosphere
already burdened by the Asian crisis, the International Monetary
Fund and big industrial countries let it happen. And jittery
foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but to get out
of emerging markets around the world. Russia's fall has landed one
more punch to China's economy, which already had been weakened by
the woes besetting its Asian neighbors. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-ECONOMY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Koreans groping through the
deep waters of economic collapse have divided recent history into
two eras _ before and after the International Monetary Fund. Store
placards announce IMF going-out-of business sales. Computer
software ads in subway trains cite the IMF bogeyman, warning
readers to learn new skills or risk losing their jobs. And Koreans
refer often to the good days past, compared to the diminishing,
daily life changes the IMF wrought with financial and monetary
controls imposed in a $58.35 billion bail-out package last year.
Koreans give the IMF a mixed review, welcoming some reforms the
agency spurred in this nation's economy, at the same time they cite
Korea as an example of the IMF gone wrong. A one-time ``Asian
tiger,'' Korea has been sorely wounded. (Kunstel, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ECONOMY _ KIARA PAYUNG, Indonesia _ In once-prosperous
villages like this one, hundreds of thousands of children are
dropping out of school and going hungry as the Asian economic
collapse brings real poverty back to the Indonesian countryside.
``I don't go to school any more,'' says Supendi, a 13-year-old boy.
``The school fee is 3,000 rupiahs (40 cents) a month, and my mother
doesn't have enough money to pay it.'' So Supendi lounges away the
muggy midday heat by crouching on a tin-roofed porch and listening
to the young men of Kiara Payung talk about ``the old days'' just
one year ago. It's only been a year since this fast-growing,
seemingly stable nation of 210 million people was dragged down by
the riptide of the Asian economic crisis. (Albright, Cox News
Service).

   ASIA-QUOTES _ The Faces of the Asian Economic Crisis. These
quotes, each accompanied by head shots, will move as a quote box,
but can be dropped in as individual illustrations to match the
package of stories. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-DATA _ The vital statistics on the 20 APEC countries.
(Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASIA _ WASHINGTON _ When the world picks up the phone
and dials 911 these days, it's increasingly the president of the
United States who answers the call. In an extraordinary year of
crisis management, President Clinton has helped to broker
agreements aimed at ending bloodshed in Northern Ireland, Kosovo
and the Middle East. He's struggled, with mixed results, to bring
to heel weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq and Iran,
worked to hold together a plan that keeps in check North Korea's
nuclear ambitions and urged India and Pakistan to step back from
perilous nuclear saber-rattling and instead commit to a global arms
control regime. In the days ahead, he'll be focused on trying to
arrest a virulent strain of global economic contagion that has
already decimated half a dozen Asian economies, threatens much of
the emerging world and poses enormous risks to growth and wealth in
the United States. ''This is the nature of things in the world
today,'' Clinton said recently. ''Not everything we have to do is
easy.'' (Deans, Cox News Service).

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Gary M.
Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine to
Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529, a small propeller-driven plane that crashed in a
hayfield in West Georgia killing 10 of the 29 people aboard. In a
seven-part series beginning Sunday, Pomerantz vividly describes the
9 minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard the doomed aircraft and
how the tragedy has reshaped lives. WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
for the series from Parts One, Two and Three. Here is the budget
line for Part One:
</P>
<P>
   DAY 1 _ Nov. 15
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-THEFALL _ ASA Flight 529 was more than three miles high
when a propeller blade broke off its left wing. The twin-engine
Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane carrying 29 people shuddered and
fell. In window seat 2-A, a young woman who had served in the Army
thought she'd heard a small cannon explode. She looked out and saw
the propeller declare war on the left wing. She slammed shut her
window shade, frightened by the sight and what it meant. Flight
attendant Robin Fech grabbed the metal kitchen galley where the
passengers' drinks were stored to steady herself. Soda cans
trembled. Under her breath, Fech cursed. Of the 29 people aboard,
19 would live to tell about it. In the telling, survivors almost
without exception have asked themselves the same question about
those nine minutes and 20 seconds: Was it really that long?

   RESCUERANCH _ UTOPIA, Texas _ Three years ago, Kinky Friedman
found a kitten on the side of the road near his home west of San
Antonio. It had been shot. He took it to a vet who saved its life.
Hence, the name Lucky. Friedman gave it to a considerate friend in
Utopia who would later accept more of his rescued animals, mostly
dogs. It was the start of one of his dreams - to start an animal
rescue group. Thus the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch was born. The
author solicited the help of Ann Richards, Willie Nelson, Lamar
Smith and others who serve on an advisory board. The rescue ranch
is run by Nancy Parker and Tony Simons, two of Friedman's friends,
who also share in the dream of saving every animal in this planet.

Lewis. (Shepard, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   SIXTH _ Whenever the election date is set, national attention
will focus on northside Atlanta's 6th District. Not because of the
election so much but because it is the seat being vacated by the
former House speaker. What are the national cameras likely to see
in this district that in many ways represents the Atlanta of the
New South? While still predominately white, the district, which
spans four counties, includes a growing number of middle-class
black residents and is the picture of Atlanta when it comes to
describing the transient nature of the town and how it is wrestling
with growth vs. preservation issues. (Manuel, Atlanta

   EDISON _ It's hard to find anyone in an Edison school who
doesn't like it. Despite a rocky start in a few school systems and
only slight improvement in test scores, ``Edisonized'' parents,
teachers, and students seem overwhelmingly happy with the education
management company. Reporters in Michigan, Washington, D.C., and
Miami found children and teachers enthusiastic about the
curriculum, the computers, even the longer school day. Teachers say
they feel more free to design their own programs and enjoy the
ability to e-mail parents on the families' Edison-issued computers.
Parents are on a waiting list for the Miami school. The Atlanta
Public Schools system is in contract negotiations with the
education management company to take over possibly three Atlanta
elementary schools, but has also put out requests for proposals to
other education management companies, delaying what was initially
expected to be a December vote on Edison. (Carter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH PHOTO

   MONEY _ How can Edison do what it promises? That is, to take the
same per-pupil tax dollars a system normally receives for its
students and provide every teacher with a classroom telephone,
every family with a home computer, every school with $1.5 million
in improvements, and make a profit, too? Edison says it's doing it,
with the school systems' tax dollars and its own resources from
investors. The company is now preparing to sell stock to teachers
and plans to take its stock options public. One critic cautions
that Edison founder Chris Whittle saw his former company, Whittle
Communications, go bankrupt (checking on that), and says venture
capitalists like the ones investing in Edison may not stick around
for long. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight,
graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust,
even break, most people.
</P>
<P>
   There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at
his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the grocery
store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they
arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby
killer. Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a
week, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an
abortion doctor by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. He
might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who
shadowed him at work and on weekends. Then he would do something
unexpected, like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or
stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was killed Oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through
the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a
furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on
abortion providers in western New York state and Canada, friends
and relatives wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse
such murderous violence. He had predicted as much himself. Instead,
they wondered, once again, that he persisted in that work, long
after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to the pressure of
abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if
your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do about
it,'' said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece. ``And he
was incredibly stubborn. He said that women had a right to
comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor, he was
going to provide it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years
in bombings and shootings that have killed 7 people and wounded 17
at abortion clinics around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor. To members
of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause.
But Slepian was far from either. In interviews with friends and
family members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract
_ a conservative who advocated old-fashioned values like
self-reliance, a shy man who had rare flashes of anger, a doctor
who performed abortions but had no more patience for women who had
multiple abortions than for women who had multiple children they
did not want or could not support.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has
become emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing in his life
to suggest he was a crusader in either politics or medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he was an obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable
thing. Out of contrariness and out of conscience, say those who
knew him, he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor
he should be, and for that, he paid with his life.
</P>
<P>
   The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment lie, in part,
in his upbringing. His was a family that took success for granted
even as it teetered on the edge of poverty. To earn money for
medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. He
made few friends, but those he had were friends for life. When
their wives were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely,
he flew to their side.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell people that he
chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes a doctor to
the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because it was
legal and the alternatives were so much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him
for abortion after abortion. ``Don't they get it?'' his clinic
staff recall him saying more than once.
</P>
<P>
   He had the same impatience for women like those he remembered
from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child after child
and no means of support. ``He had the contempt for that of somebody
who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it in the
world,'' Ms. Robb said.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that to ban abortions or, just as shameful in his
view, to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them, would not
correct the human imperfections that he found so irritating.
``There are 1.5 million abortions performed in this country,'' his
niece said, ``and he just felt we're not equipped to handle 1.5
million unwanted children.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was killed, at the age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an
imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of Amherst, complete
with a swimming pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the
time-saving gadgets he adored.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been
unconventional. His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who
started out selling shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled
all five of his sons into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the
university's blue-blood standards. His father, in turn, decreed
that his own three sons would be doctors or earn Ph.D's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a home where there was tremendous, tremendous,
tremendous respect for education,'' said Serena Robb, Slepian's
sister, who is four years older than him. ``If you got an A, it was
OK If you got a B, you got yelled at.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's means did not match its expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's father, Philip, had joined his own father's business
manufacturing leather soles for shoes. Soon after Bart was born in
1946 in Boston, the company failed, so to save money, the father
moved his family of six to his in-laws' apartment in McKeesport,
Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Once settled, Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance
writer, crisscrossing the country in his old Studebaker,
researching the origins of prominent citizens at the Library of
Congress and writing their stories for small-town newspapers. He
sold articles by the hundreds, and was still writing until his
death nine years ago at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
   The success that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come
easily. As a child, he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked
at him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he went to a
local community college before transferring to the University of
Denver, where he majored in zoology. Rejected by medical schools in
the United States _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the
late 1960s _ he studied one year in Belgium and then enrolled at
the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His friends remember him as funny and obstinate, a thin young
man with glasses and a receding hairline who beat all comers at
arm-wrestling and pool. ``Bart had certain beliefs, strongly
held,'' said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who is an internist
on Long Island. ``He always said you shouldn't sit around whining
about things,'' Schwarz said. ``He would say, `Go after what's
yours and what's right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Slepian's determination surfaced in quirky ways. He once
insisted on going to the top of the World Trade Center, despite a
crippling fear of heights. To get to the window, he crawled, inch
by inch. ``I said, `You don't have to do this,' '' recalled
Schwarz, who was with him at the time. ``And he said, `I want to do
it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to drop out of school every few semesters to work, he
lived in Reno with his sister Serena, a widow who was struggling to
take care of two young daughters. She worked as a waitress and a
blackjack dealer, sharing her tips with him while he drove a cab,
cleaned barns at a ranch and worked as a laboratory assistant at
the local Veterans Administration hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency.
There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his
junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics
practice from a doctor who was about to retire.
</P>
<P>
   He had a soothing, unhurried manner. When a patient of his,
Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes, Slepian referred her to
a specialist but called every few days for months to help her
overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for her insulin
injections. ``The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,''' Mrs.
Durlak recalled. ``Not Dr. Slepian.''
</P>
<P>
   In most ways, he was a typical suburban family man, working six
days a week and spending his free time at Little League games and
county fairs with his four sons. But by the late 1980s, he and
other abortion doctors in Buffalo were under siege.
</P>
<P>
   In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, the Rev.
Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion
leaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled
into the clinic driveway. Slepian parked on the street. As he
pushed his way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck
cupped his hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, ``Slepian,
you pig!''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his
private life were futile. The protests followed him home and the
man who had been so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably,
at the center of controversy and attention.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, when demonstrators jeered at
him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he opened Hanukkah
presents with his children, the doctor came out brandishing a
baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, but a town judge ordered
him to repair one protester's smashed van window and pay a portion
of another's medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst surprised his family and friends. It was not
Slepian's style to make a public fuss, much less acknowledge the
stress of being taunted by protesters. ``Stress?'' his oldest
brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about the doctor's mood.
``I never heard the word used in my family, except as an
engineering term. He said it was a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Slepian did not respond to requests for an interview. She
expressed rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She
said that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty
and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection
herself. She also spoke out after Schenck's brother, Robert,
another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian,
sent a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounced him as ``a
hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   After the confrontation in 1988, Slepian turned to civil
harassment lawsuits, letters and levity to deal with the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when a man active in the anti-abortion effort was
arrested for rifling through the doctor's garbage cans at home,
Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. ``They hopefully got
the bags full of dirty diapers,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper. He
told The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their
energies to helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth
control and counseling. In a letter to the editor he warned that by
repeatedly calling him a murderer, his critics were inciting
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral
conviction, his friends said, but resented the personal attacks.
``He thought it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased
the danger,'' said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took
a step that few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors
dared. He insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut
through the venom.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety,
Slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he
recognized outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo,
where he worked two days a week. He surprised a gathering of
protesters who were preparing for what they euphemistically called
a ``house call,'' or demonstration at the doctor's home, and
invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. Robert Behn, to
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Their hourlong conversation the next morning was inconclusive,
Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an ``attempt to get
people to like him.'' He asked Slepian how performing abortions
affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor
said, ``I'm fine spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time away from home with his
family. He planned to take a cruise next spring. He bought a
time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had so many plans,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the
couple for 15 years. ``He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow
would appear.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday
gift, Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he
would teach it his eulogy. ``He would talk about the funeral he
wanted,'' Mrs. Fink said. ``He said he didn't have a lot of friends
and wanted all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car,
so he'd have a long procession.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons to be
preoccupied with thoughts of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   A medical checkup had revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs.
Fink said, recounting a conversation with Mrs. Slepian the day of
the slaying. A blockage is a sign of probable coronary artery
disease. He was to have more tests the following week. ``I said,
`Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,''' Mrs. Fink recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax to
the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks on
abortion doctors that occurred in early November. Marilynne
Buckham, the clinic director, sent it to Slepian. ``He definitely
took it seriously,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he might have
felt. ``It was a normal day,'' said Tammi Latini, his office
assistant. ``We were horsing around.'
</P>
<P>
   That evening, the Slepians went to synagogue to mark the ninth
anniversary of the death of Slepian's father. Shortly after they
returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed through the kitchen
window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his wife and sons.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters returned to the clinic five days later, the first
day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, said Slepian would not
have been surprised. They have their routine. So did he.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,'' she said. ``At
the end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And
he would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having
me.'''

WILLIAM CURRY MOLONEY, 91, EXPERT ON BLOOD DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.H.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Curry Moloney, who studied and treated blood diseases
well before hematology became a medical specialty, died on Nov. 3
in Boston at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he had once been a
director of hematology. He was 91 and lived in Chatham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney was one of the first to use chemotherapy for treating
leukemia and lymphoma. He was an early contributor to the
development of specific diagnostic tests, some of which remain in
use today.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston, he worked his way through Tufts College and
Tufts Medical School and started his career as a family doctor in
Jamaica Plain, Mass. Such conditions as anemia, bleeding problems
and leukemia soon absorbed him. He began to carry along what he
called his ``lab equipment'' in his black bag and became known as a
leading blood consultant in and around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Driving his old blue Dodge, he administered Rh tests and did
bone-marrow examinations at many New England hospitals using
materials he kept in a cigar box secured with an elastic band. He
also established much-needed blood banks throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   He was a recognized authority on safe procedures for blood
transfusions, and his expertise in blood banks stood him in good
stead in World War II, when he oversaw transfusions to wounded
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, in the early 1950s, he directed research for the
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Hiroshima, Japan, and later in
the Marshall Islands he studied the effects of errant radiation and
the mechanisms that produce leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney joined the faculty of Tufts Medical School in 1934 and
rose to clinical professor. He moved to Harvard Medical School with
the same rank in 1971 and reached emeritus status there in 1974. He
was named chief of hematology at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, now
Brigham and Women's, in 1966 and continued his bone-marrow and
leukemia research there until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney is survived by two sons, Thomas of Chatham, and William
of New Bedford, Mass.; a daughter, Patricia McGrath of Keene, N.H.;
24 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

ABC SPORTS' LESLEY VISSER KEEPS MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the ABC sports reporter Lesley Visser was informed last
April that she would become the new sideline reporter on ``Monday
Night Football'' and thus the first female member of the broadcast
team, she knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   After covering the National Football League and special
assignments for CBS Sports from 1988 to 1994, she joined ABC Sports
in 1994, serving as a reporter on ESPN's ``GameDay'' and as the
leading correspondent for ABC's ``Wide World of Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Visser soon discovered that more than a little fitness and
stamina are required for her new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's both exciting and physically exhausting because I am
constantly moving for three and a half hours,'' said Visser, who
supplements the play-by-play team of Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and
Boomer Esiason. ``I compare myself to being a duck on the pond
because you have to be placid on the surface, and yet I'm
constantly moving my legs to keep afloat of what's going on in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the responsibility of gathering and disseminating
news from the sideline in less than a minute of air time, Visser's
task is to present the information in a tone appropriate to the
particular story.
</P>
<P>
   When Tampa Bay wide receiver Brice Hunter seriously injured his
neck Sept. 28 against Detroit, Visser's frequent updates on
Hunter's condition conveyed the seriousness of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesley is a terrific reporter and makes our telecast better
because she works so hard,'' said Steve Anderson, the senior vice
president for production for ABC Sports. ``She has excellent
credibility, and the players and coaches respect her. Having Lesley
on the sideline is a great luxury for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently in its 29th season on ABC, ``Monday Night Football''
was able to carve out its own niche from the beginning. Visser
credits its immediate impact on viewers to the foresight three
decades ago of Pete Rozelle, then the commissioner of the NFL, and
Roone Arledge, then the president of ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both had a vision of what the show could become,'' Visser
said. ``At the time, ABC was the No. 3 network _ behind NBC and CBS
_ so they didn't have anything to lose in the ratings.
Sophisticated technology was implemented, and Arledge knew it would
be good theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Visser, with her husband Dick Stockton, a broadcast journalist
for Fox and TNT, has been covering athletes since 1974, when she
joined the Boston Globe sports staff on a grant from the Carnegie
Foundation. She stayed with the Globe for 14 years before taking a
full-time job with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   So Visser understands why athletes shy away from the spotlight;
she notes that even now, Esiason cannot walk through a hotel lobby
without being bombarded by hundreds of fans. But, she said, ``I
think that all athletes have an obligation to be gracious to the
fans while they are in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Visser's on-the-field obligations are formulaic, if frenzied.
Under normal circumstances, as the game winds down, Visser and the
production crew have a set formula for the post-game interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the two-minute mark, the producer will ask me what
interview I want to do at the end of the game,'' Visser said.
``Usually it is pretty obvious. We have to be respectful that the
player is going to want to say hi to his friends on the opposing
team, but there isn't much time, so I have to follow the player and
grab him almost immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as difficult as plucking the player away from friends and
fans is coming up with questions that will avoid one-word answers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best _ and certainly the easiest _ parts of the job,
Visser said, is listening to Michaels, Dierdorf and Esiason in the
booth because they are all passionately opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   Watching players who love to play the game, like Brett Favre or
Barry Sanders, is what Visser enjoys most about her work. The
compelling aspects of the game fascinate her, not knowing what to
expect from each play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to be at the site of the competition,'' Visser
said. ``I don't want to be in the studio and miss the action. When
people ask me what my favorite place in America is, my answer is
Green Bay in January.''

BOATING: KEEPING THE HELM IN AMATEUR SAILORS' HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New rules in one-design sailing are encouraging amateurs at the
expense of professionals. But the seascape is as competitive as
ever in yacht racing. Consider the names of boats entered this week
in the 1998 Mumm 30 World Championship: Instigator, Menace,
Stinger, Trouble and Twisted Lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Read, a world-class champion, plans to keep a low profile
amid the onslaught of amateurs. ``I'm not sure classes like this
want people like me around,'' Read said in a telephone interview
last week. ``As a rule of thumb, I plan to play as much golf as I
sail. It will kind of be my self-handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   Read usually takes over the helm for wealthy boat owners at
international regattas. As a six-time champion in the J-24 Class
and a former America's Cup trials helmsman from Newport, R.I., the
37-year-old Read is at the pinnacle of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   But at the four-day Mumm regatta scheduled to begin Tuesday at
Hilton Head Island, S.C., he will not be allowed to steer.
One-design class rules these days are trying to reserve the
helmsman position for amateur boat owners. At Hilton Head, 35 boats
from 6 countries are expected to compete. It is an international
event with an amateur flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't want is for someone to come in and wreck the
class,'' said Geoff Stagg, marketing agent for Bruce Farr &AMP;
Associates, the Mumm 30's designer. ``We are monitoring the skill
level of the class. It can be a very contentious thing, but the
owners love it.''
</P>
<P>
   By monitoring, Stagg means making sure that none of sailing's
rock star professionals compete at the wheel against the amateurs
who own Mumm 30s. A limited number of pros can sail on the boats,
but they cannot man the helm. It's a way of assuring amateur owners
_ who pay $118,000 for a new Mumm 30 _ that they will not be
upstaged by another boat's pro driver.
</P>
<P>
   Read will sail as one of six crew members on Off the Gauge, a
Mumm 30 owned by a longtime friend, Jack LeFort, of Stuart, Fla.
But LeFort, an amateur sailor, has bought into the right to steer
his own boat.
</P>
<P>
   Read agrees with the owner/amateur/helmsman idea, despite its
potential for costing him jobs. ``What people lose sight of,'' he
said, ``is that this sport revolves around people who pay the bills
and still want to have plenty of fun. The Mumm 36 Class has hit the
problem head-on, and it's one of the few that has.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner-driver rule has emerged over the last few years.
Besides the Mumm 30, the rule exists in some form in classes such
as the Shock 35, the Farr 40 and the One Design 35. The concept is
untried in more than 75 of the other one-design classes recognized
by U.S. Sailing, the sport's governing authority.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the Mumm 30 Class have been relatively lenient
with its amateur designation. Stagg said that of the 143 boats
built since the inception of the class in 1996, 5 or so owners have
a degree of professional status. One is JB Braun, part-owner of
Thalia, a Mumm 30 expected to compete this week. His co-owner from
Marblehead, Mass., is Bob Shear, an amateur. Braun is rated by U.S.
Sailing as a Category 3 sailor, a designation that ranks him as a
professional. He is a commercial sailmaker, and in 1988, was an
alternate for the Olympic Flying Dutchman Class.
</P>
<P>
   The Mumm 30 Class has accommodated Braun through a clause
requiring Category 3 sailors to put up a substantial part of a new
boat's price. For a new Mumm 30, that would be about $50,000, or
about 50 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Braun says that is fair. ``The rule is there to stop people who
are working for marine companies from getting paid just to go
sailing,'' he said. ``By owning a boat, it shows a personal
commitment to the class. And I think that's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Allsopp, a sailmaker from Annapolis, Md., has got around the
rule by buying a Mumm 30 himself. When that proved too costly, he
sold his boat and bought half of Moxie, a Mumm 30 owned by George
Collins, a retired investment executive from Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say owners and amateurs, I don't think of myself as a
professional,'' he said recently. ``I have a full-time job as a
sailmaker. But I work from 9-to-5 and sail as much as I can. I
don't get paid to step on a boat, and that's a huge difference.''

VOICE OF INEXPERIENCE: ST. JOHN'S BARKLEY KNOWS HE HAS MUCH TO
LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He will tell you that the expectations will not
bother him, that he can handle the burden placed on his slender
shoulders, shoulders that, up close, are clearly those of a
freshman. But when Erick Barkley launched his first shot of the
basketball preseason, his first as a starting point guard for the
St. John's Red Storm, the 3-point attempt left his hands a bit too
quickly, even though no defender was near him.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball dropped a good foot short of the rim, Barkley's
shoulders dropped, too. He would end the game making 2 of 9 from
3-point range, would miss on an attempt to win the game in the
final seconds of regulation and would endure the first of what
figure to be many learning experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerves,'' Barkley said, scanning the box score after that
exhibition game two weeks ago, in which Barkley compiled 17 points,
6 assists and 5 steals. Then he repeated it in a way that made you
believe that the lack of composure might last. ``Nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barkley felt them that day, then Mike Jarvis should, too. His
hopes in his inaugural season as head coach of St. John's hinge
greatly on Barkley's ability to acclimate quickly to the rigors of
Big East basketball. Jarvis has handed the ball to the highly
touted point guard and insisted from the first day of practice that
he had no fear that Barkley was up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, in the Red Storm's second and final exhibition
game, Barkley turned the ball over seven times, sometimes trying to
dribble through traffic or force a pass into a sliver of space that
even he, with his uncanny accuracy, could not find. If those
moments are the things that will keep Jarvis awake at night, then
images will also flash through of plays like the 3-on-2 fast break
he ran, dribbling up the middle of the floor at full speed,
swooping into the heart of the defense and then deftly slipping the
ball around the back of one defender to find Bootsy Thornton for an
easy layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erick is obviously one of the building blocks of the
program,'' Jarvis said after that game. ``Erick Barkley is going to
be a great point guard, but Erick Barkley is a freshman. Tonight,
at times, he played like one and, at times, he played like a
senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said, ``I'm only human and I'm going to make mistakes,
but that's part of me learning as a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot of teaching and even more patience. The team
that Barkley will lead has little more experience than he does.
Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton, the stars of last year's team
that earned a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
berth, are gone. Ron Artest, the Big East rookie of the year last
season, must score more as well as man the inside at times for the
undersized Red Storm. Tyrone Grant and Lavor Postell, bit players a
year ago, are being pushed into the spotlight, along with Thornton,
a junior college transfer whose early tenure in the Big East may
consist of trying to score enough to make up for his defensive
failings. Another junior college transfer, Albert Richardson, will
probably start at center.
</P>
<P>
   It is Barkley who is being asked to hold the team together,
using his familiarity with the players from their days on the
playgrounds of New York, from the heated contests of the summer
leagues and the afternoon sessions at Alumni Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the grace period is limited for a player chosen by Big East
coaches as the preseason co-rookie of the year, along with
Georgetown's Anthony Perry. ``I read the clippings, but I try not
to let that put pressure on me,'' Barkley said. ``I just try to
relax and just play how I normally play.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, a child of the city, has grown up seeing New York
legends like Kenny Anderson and Stephon Marbury live and die
through large-type headlines. ``Sometimes I try not to read it,''
he said. ``I really don't like it. A freshman should not be exposed
to the public like that. But exposure is good. I know it can help
me or break me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, his roommate and a senior co-captain, said: ``I believe
Erick deserves everything he's getting because he's as good as
advertised. Sooner or later, you're all going to get the
opportunity to experience what I've been experiencing the last
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of nine children who grew up nearby in the Farragut
section of Brooklyn, Barkley starred at Christ the King High School
before going to Maine Central Institute last year, a prep school,
as much to refine his study skills as his playmaking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back home, with friends and family crowding the stands
at Alumni Hall. There is the pressure of being a freshman trying to
guide a big-time program as well as the pressure of doing it in
your hometown. ``My head is pretty much on straight now,'' Barkley
said. ``I don't think nothing can stop me from what I'm striving
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis added: ``I hope he doesn't change. I hope fans, people
telling him he's not scoring enough or not doing this and doing
that, don't change him. He doesn't have to change for anybody. He's
got the package. The only thing he doesn't have is the college
experience. He's going to get it.'' &QL;

 WASHINGTON: money, money.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was another turning point in November 1996. The
lawyer-journalist Stuart Taylor Jr. analyzed the case and concluded
that the evidence against Clinton was far stronger than many people
thought. His article in The American Lawyer magazine carried
considerable weight among journalists.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, 1997, the case was elevated to constitutional status
as it was argued before the Supreme Court, on the question of
whether a sitting president could be sued for actions unrelated to
his office. On May 27, the court ruled unanimously that he could.
Wright then decreed that the trial would begin a year hence.
</P>
<P>
   One comment by Justice John Paul Stevens proved stunningly
inaccurate. The case, he said, ``appears to us highly unlikely to
occupy any substantial amount'' of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff, said on Friday
that the ruling set ``a terrible precedent for future presidents''
who might be beset by scandal and scandal-mongers while trying to
guide the country in peace and war.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis Michael Seidman, a Georgetown University law
professor, said he thought the court was right, regardless of any
disruption in the work of the Oval Office. ``Courts can get rid of
frivolous suits very easily,'' he said. ``This one wasn't
frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late summer of 1997, it may have been too late to settle.
Clinton's legal team was offering $700,000, along with an
expression of regret without an admission of wrongdoing. Davis and
Cammarata urged Mrs. Jones to accept, telling her that her position
would never be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jones had a falling out with her lawyers. Soon she had
a new legal team, along with backing from the conservative
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   As he rode in a limousine to give a pretrial deposition in Mrs.
Jones' lawsuit on the gray Saturday of Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton knew
he would be asked about other women as Mrs. Jones' lawyers tried to
establish a pattern of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone knew then that he had been involved with a White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Even fewer people knew that Mrs.
Lewinsky's telephone pinings and yearnings had been tape-recorded
by a supposed friend.
</P>
<P>
   At the pretrial hearing, Clinton was asked if he had ever had
sexual relations with Mrs. Lewinsky. No, he answered, under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, perhaps even days later, it might not have been too
late for the president to change his testimony, lawyers involved in
the case have said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had chosen a course of denial, one he would hold for
seven months. Over that time, one of the few bits of good news for
him was Wright's dismissal of Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. That happened on
April Fool's Day, but the president's troubles were still far from
over.

U.S. WAS JUST HOURS AWAY FROM ATTACKING IRAQ, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON and STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States had prepared to begin a massive
campaign of air strikes on Iraq on Saturday but called off the
mission after a last-minute flurry of diplomatic activity brought
an Iraqi announcement that it would allow U.N. weapons inspectors
to resume their work, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted Saturday that American air strikes over the
weekend were still being actively considered.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the first wave of air strikes authorized by
President Clinton, which had been due to occur Saturday evening
Iraq time, or during Washington's day, had been called off. The
strikes would have involved cruise missile attacks and the bombing
of Iraqi targets by jet fighters stationed aboard the aircraft
carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower. The attack was called off, officials
said, because of a last-ditch plea to Iraq issued Friday night by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq's announcement hours
later that it would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their
``normal work'' in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost as if he knew,'' said a Pentagon official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to the timing of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's apparent decision to back down
from a confrontation with the United States. ``It was real close.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton had been urged by
senior advisers to begin the air strikes earlier last week, if only
to avoid the situation that is now unfolding, with the United
States left once again in the awkward position of rushing a massive
military force to the Persian Gulf to confront Iraq, only to have
the Iraqis back down at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they feared that the administration, which had
largely abandoned hope that the U.N. weapons program would be
allowed to resume its work in any meaningful way, was left with the
worst of all scenarios: an ineffective inspection program, Hussein
still fully in charge, and a massive American military force in the
Persian Gulf without a clear mission.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Iraq's announcement that it would resume
cooperation with the United Nations in the hunt for stockpiles of
weapons of mass destruction would make it difficult for Clinton to
order an attack without allowing Annan at least a little more time
to try to hammer out a deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also noted that Clinton has scheduled a
10-day trip to Asia, and that it would be difficult for him to
order a major military strike and deal with the diplomatic
aftermath while out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   His senior national security advisers _ including Defense
Secretary William Cohen, national security adviser Sandy Berger,
Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and CIA
director George Tenet _ met at the White House on Saturday to
discuss how to respond to the Iraq announcement. The initial White
House reaction was one of cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very high degree of skepticism about Iraqi
intentions,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. ``The president's national-security team is
reviewing the latest developments in a very prudent and deliberate
way and will make a recommendation on what the appropriate next
steps are.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by administration officials to disclose details of
the military's plans to attack Iraq on Saturday appeared to be an
effort to convince both the American public and the Iraqi
government that Clinton had been prepared to act decisively after
years of criticism that he had been too timid in confronting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people in the administration who wanted _ and
expected _ that we would significantly weaken Saddam with a heavy,
sustained bombing campaign,'' said an administration official who
was eager for an attack and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``But once again, we've hitched our wagon with UNSCOM, even though
UNSCOM doesn't work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM is the acronym for the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the disarmament program imposed on Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War. The current crisis began last August when the Iraqis
ordered the United Nations to end most weapons inspections until
crippling economic sanctions on Iraq were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   American officials now fear that the Iraqis will once again play
for time.
</P>
<P>
   And then, once the world's attention has turned away from Iraq
and the United States has withdrawn much of its naval fleet and air
armada from the region, Iraq could begin _ once again _ to
interfere with the arms inspections, sparking yet another crisis
requiring an American military buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rerun,'' said another administration official involved
in Iraq policy who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The situation unfolding Saturday was similar in many ways to
that played out late last year and earlier this year, when Iraq
tried to expel Americans from the U.N. arms inspection teams,
prompting Clinton to threaten air strikes against Iraq and to order
warships and planes to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis ended when the Iraqi government blinked at the
eleventh hour, but not before the United States spent billions of
dollars to beef up its military forces near Iraq, disrupting
American military planning around the world for months thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The American military force now surrounding Iraq was expected to
grow markedly more powerful over the weekend as a wave of six B-52
bombers loaded with air-launched cruise missiles departed for the
Gulf on Saturday from Barksdale Air Force Base, La.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the heavy bombers were to be followed by a
additional fleet of F-15 and F-16 jet fighters and B-1 bombers. The
aircraft carrier Enterprise, with about 75 jet fighters, is also en
route to the gulf, and is expected to arrive on Nov. 23.

LAWYERS' PLAN TO QUIT LINKED TO JONES' DECISION TO SETTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Texas, Va., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Paula Jones to agree to settle her sexual
misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton, she had to be
convinced that the best time to strike a deal was now. Her many
advisers worked to make her realize that even if she went ahead
with the lawsuit and won a jury verdict she would probably get only
a small amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton to agree to a settlement, there had to be no apology
required of him, so he would still be able to deny her account of a
coarse sexual proposition in 1991 in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel
room. And the deal would have to exclude Abe Hirschfeld, a New York
real estate executive who had said he would give her $1 million to
settle with the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, lawyers for both parties satisfied those
concerns. On Friday, they announced that Mrs. Jones would withdraw
her lawsuit in exchange for a payment of $850,000 from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no apology. Moreover, she agreed that she would
not accept any money from Hirschfeld, though by the time the
settlement was reached, no one in the Jones camp regarded
Hirschfeld as reliable in anything but his ardor for publicity.
After an elaborate televised ceremony in Washington on Oct. 31, in
which he promised in writing to send $1 million to an escrow
account, he did not do so.
</P>
<P>
   But the event that seemed to shock Mrs. Jones and make her more
pliant about a settlement, one of her friends said, was the
decision of the group of lawyers who represented her in court to
withdraw from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they like me anymore?'' Mrs. Jones asked a friend
after the lawyers told her they would leave her case in the next
month or so.
</P>
<P>
   She had come to count on the team of lawyers from Dallas and
Charlottesville, Va., who had stood at her side since September
1997, when her previous lawyers, impatient with her resistance to a
settlement, withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal foundation in
Charlottesville, stepped into the breach, saying it would pay her
legal costs, and it recruited a Dallas firm to represent her.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jones' new lawyers became annoyed with her and even
more with her husband, Stephen Jones. The Dallas law firm of Rader,
Fisher, Campbell &AMP; Pyke had already spent an estimated $1.4 million
in legal fees to help Mrs. Jones. John Whitehead, the president of
the Rutherford Institute, had paid legal expenses exceeding
$400,000. Moreover, the Rutherford Institute was paying to
represent Stephen Jones in a separate lawsuit against Northwest
Airlines, charging he was wrongfully dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers were withdrawing, they said, because they
were annoyed that she did not accept their advice to strike a deal
with Clinton, accepting an amount between $500,000 and $1 million,
and to forget about the Hirschfeld offer. The White House officials
had said repeatedly they would not participate in any deal that
involved Hirschfeld both because he is under indictment for tax
fraud and any contribution by him could be seen questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who specializes in sexual
harassment law, said that if Mrs. Jones ultimately won her case she
could probably count on receiving less than $100,000 in damages.
``This was the right time for her to strike politically,'' Ms. Katz
said recently. ``The president was eager to settle and give her
more than she would get from even winning in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had his own powerful motives for achieving a settlement.
The case had been dismissed by a trial court judge in Little Rock,
but a three-judge appeals panel was considering reinstating the
case. The comments of the judges during oral arguments last month
in St. Paul had convinced White House officials that the Jones case
would go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean the president could be deposed again in detail
about his sexual encounters. The last time he was deposed, on Jan.
17, he denied engaging in sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, a
statement he defended by saying the Jones lawyers did not ask
questions that were sufficiently specific.
</P>
<P>
   In another deposition, Clinton could expect the questions to be
very specific.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were eager to settle, largely to help the
president deal with Congress over impeachment proceedings. The
House Judiciary Committee is considering whether Clinton's answers
in the Jan. 17 deposition amounted to perjury and whether that
constitutes an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   While a settlement would not help Clinton in strictly legal
terms, he and his advisers believed it would make it more difficult
for Congress to move against him for behavior named in a lawsuit
that no longer existed.
</P>
<P>
   They said that part of the argument against Clinton was that in
giving misleading testimony about Ms. Lewinsky to the Jones
lawyers, he deprived Mrs. Jones of a fair opportunity to make her
sexual harassment case against him. One White House official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, has said a settlement will
allow the president's defenders to counter that Mrs. Jones was, in
the end, not penalized but satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   A remaining issue for the Jones camp is how to divide the money.
Mrs. Jones, her associates have said, would like to net $300,000 to
$500,000 of the settlement herself, leaving the lawyers to divide
up the rest.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: JEFFERSON, HEMINGS AND RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BRENT STAPLES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proof that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child with Sally
Hemings has embarrassed historians who saw him as too noble for sex
with a slave _ and vindicated black descendants who knew all along
that he was as lusty as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests have linked Jefferson to Hemings' final child,
Eston, born in 1808. But even historians who defended Jefferson for
decades are finding it hard to believe that he avoided Hemings
while the two were young and vital and made her his lover only as
he approached the grave. The emerging consensus is that the two
became lovers earlier and that the affair went on longer than we
yet know.
</P>
<P>
   The first paradox was that Jefferson wrote the Declaration of
Independence while enslaving others. The new paradox is that he
produced a mixed-race child with a slave while maintaining that
African-Americans were only marginally human and a threat to white
racial integrity. Jefferson was notoriously self-deceptive. Even
so, it is quite possible that he viewed the mulatto Sally Hemings
not as black, but as part of some middle category.
</P>
<P>
   Racial distinctions that now seem etched in stone were fluid and
hotly disputed in the slave-era South. As the recipient of
America's first slaves, Virginia was first to encounter the
confusions of miscegenation, which produced a class of people who
were neither black nor white but could often live as either,
depending on preference and the needs of the moment. There were
court battles galore to determine who was what.
</P>
<P>
   Present-day America, obsessed with race, is blind to this
complicated past. The fact is that racial distinctions are as
shifting and arbitrary as they were when Sally met Tom.
</P>
<P>
   The first slave ships sailed into Jamestown harbor in 1619. The
Virginia criminal records show the first prosecution for
interracial sex 10 years later, when a white man named Hugh Davis
was forced to confess in church and ``soundly whipped before an
assemblage of Negroes and others for abusing himself to the
dishonor of God and the same of Christians by defiling his body in
lying with a Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   But laws and public whippings were no check on lust across the
color line. As slaves grew whiter and whiter, lawmakers scrambled
for legal definitions to distinguish black from white. The first
laws in Virginia _ widely copied elsewhere _ defined anyone who was
``one-fourth white or more'' as mulatto. The question of how much
black blood one could have and be classified ``white'' was
tactfully avoided, for fear that ``white'' citizens with Negro
ancestry would be dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was especially tangled in South Carolina _
particularly in Charleston, which had developed an enormous mulatto
elite whose members were nearly as white and just as rich as anyone
in the city. Early court records are filled with cases of
fair-skinned people who were accused of being secretly mulatto but
were later declared ``white'' by a judge and jury. Racial experts
were called and family trees drawn, with the frequent result that
no one could tell where the white family began and the black one
ended.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the judge threw out the ``expert'' testimony and
the blood theory of race, deciding that the plaintiff was indeed
``white'' because he had been well received in white society and
had ``commonly exercised the privileges of a white man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that ``whiteness'' was being diluted and washed away,
South Carolinians amended their constitution to ban intermarriage,
keeping what they viewed as a sexual barrier between whites and
African-Americans. The voters struck that long-ignored provision
earlier this month, but 38 percent of them wanted to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sexual barrier between the races had never really
existed. As early as the 1700s, the clearest fact about slavery was
the lightening of its skin. The trend continued until there were
almost no blacks of strictly African descent. In this context,
race-based identity is problematical at best and genetically based
theories of race and intellectual difference seem absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemings family was a forerunner in racial ambiguity. Three
of Sally's children dropped their ``black'' identities and lived as
``whites.'' They had little choice, if they hoped to accumulate
property and move unencumbered through society. But their journey
shows us that Americans are more entangled in blood and aspiration
than we generally care to acknowledge.

WNEW FIRES DEEJAY WHO FOSTERED ROCK'S REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Muni, an FM radio pioneer who introduced New
Yorkers to the Beatles and Led Zeppelin and went on to become a
gravelly voiced rock legend of his own, was dismissed on Friday by
WNEW, the station he joined 31 years ago and helped build into a
music trendsetter.
</P>
<P>
   The station, which has been tinkering with its music format for
several years in an attempt to boost its sagging ratings and market
share, also dismissed another longtime deejay, Dave Herman, on
Friday. It has fired three other veteran deejays of Muni's era over
the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Muni, 68, by telephone were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Although Muni was still on the air until last week, as the host
of a 10 a.m.-to-noon show featuring rock of different vintages, his
days as a radio powerhouse, catered to by music producers and their
bands, had long passed.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all deejays these days, who are given playlists that
are put together by corporate researchers, he no longer had control
over the music he played on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Muni, who was nicknamed the Professor, started out as a Top 40
disk jockey, playing the standard three-minute-long pop music songs
of the 1950s on commercial AM stations. When British bands, led by
the Beatles, took the United States by storm in the 1960s, he
became a celebrity as well known as the musicians, and sometimes
invited stars like John Lennon on his show. He once played poker on
the air with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott was the man,'' said Vin Scelsa, another veteran disk
jockey who still works at WNEW and has one of the few remaining
free-form radio shows in the New York area. ``Deejays now, with the
exception of the shock jocks like Howard Stern, are insignificant
creatures in the culture. Except for fringe people or dance
deejays, they don't matter anymore in terms of the general
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott comes from an era when deejays mattered _ and Scott
mattered more than any of them in New York because he put the team
together at WNEW,'' Scelsa added.
</P>
<P>
   Muni's most significant contribution to New York radio,
colleagues said, came in the turbulent years of the late 1960s,
when he provided an outlet for the protest songs and alternative
music of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty interesting year, politically and musically,
and Scott caught wind of people like Joplin, Hendrix and Dylan _
people who were saying something interesting,'' said Meg Griffin, a
former WNEW disk jockey who left commercial radio and now works at
Fordham University's public radio station, WFUV. ``He had the
courage to get some of that on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Muni became program manager for WNEW, which was
revamping its FM format. Ms. Griffin said he turned WNEW into one
of the country's first progressive radio stations, allowing deejays
to play what they wanted, including longer album cuts, rather than
the more commercial ``bubble gum music'' that had become common on
other stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a format for the youth culture of the United
States at the time,'' Ms. Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   But the radio business has changed greatly since then, and many
of Muni's contemporaries _ deejays of the 1960s rock-and-roll era
like Dan Ingram and Bruce Morrow, known as Cousin Brucie _ do
nostalgic ``golden oldies'' shows, if they are still doing radio at
all.
</P>
<P>
   WNEW, based in New York, is now struggling to find a marketable
image in a highly competitive FM radio market. The latest Arbitron
ratings gave it an average of about 1.5 percent of the total radio
audience in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Herman, the general manager of WNEW, said Muni reacted to
the news of his dismissal with professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take the station in a different direction,'' Herman
said Saturday. ``Radio is the kind of business where you have to
keep moving forward.''

HIT RAPPER DREAMS OF BECOMING HIP HOOP ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ind.)  (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Master P, a rapper draped in diamonds and gold
who has made $57 million this year with the help of hits that
topped the singles and video charts, made his debut here Friday
night as No. 30, a guard for Indiana's Fort Wayne Fury of the
Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Fury, a farm team, is paying $1,000 a week to the man who
placed 10th this fall on Forbes magazine's list of the year's
highest-paid entertainers, ahead of the Spice Girls, Eddie Murphy
and Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,808 fans rattling around in the Connecticut State
Armory and Arsenal, where the Connecticut Pride plays its home
games, a few hundred, at most, were hip to Master P. Among most of
them, the great game was to figure out which of the tall guys in
red and black shorts and nameless jerseys was ``P,'' as he is
known. The program and announcer used only his real name, Percy
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should give away CD's, so people will know who he is,''
said Tom Nevins, 35, an engineer at a Teflon-coating plant who
prefers country music.
</P>
<P>
   As Master P tells it, though, he's not after adulation in the
seats, but rather respect on the court. His official biography
describes him as an ``actor, director, film and record producer,
the reigning king of reality rap and entrepreneur extraordinaire.''
At 28, he has founded No Limit Records (which signed Snoop Dogg),
No Limit Clothing and No Limit Sports Management.
</P>
<P>
   All that did nothing to lessen the burn he had for playing in
the National Basketball Association. So here he was in Hartford,
schlepping his own sneakers in a mesh bag, tripping over the power
cables as he checked out the court a few hours before the game. His
only goal, he said, was to prove he was serious about being a
professional athlete. He elaborated, a tad shyly, in the medium
that made him a mogul:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm off the stage. But I'm in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   `` And I'm going to make the world say, `Ughh!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm on the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Master P's side job is a con, a goof or a
fantasy, but he talks about it in only the most earnest terms.
``There's a system to get where you need to go at, and I don't mind
being a part of the system,'' he said, sauntering toward the
visitors' locker room, which was labeled Women's Shower Room. ``If
the system tells me I got to go to the CBA and go live in cities
like Fort Wayne and get to where I need to go at, that's what I got
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has. Master P flies with the team, though for security
reasons he stays at a separate, undisclosed hotel. Although he
travels with three publicists, he says he is a humble person who
likes his privacy. So after arriving in Hartford, he holed up at
the hotel and ``watched a lot of TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have done the town. The Master P thing was
almost totally lost on the Armory crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' asked Christine Perry, 34, who prefers gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be rapping, or playing?'' wondered Marvin
Lawrence, 43, who had heard his 13-year-old son play Master P. Ron
Strano, a 47-year-old general contractor, turned to his seatmate
and asked, ``He's not a gangster rapper, is he?''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Hamilton, 15, said Master P was one of his top 10
rappers, but gave up trying to pick him out as the team warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Master P's entourage kept its distance. In the locker room
before the game, the rapper was even nice to a reporter who did not
recognize him without his trademark stocking cap and earring and
started asking him what it was like to play with Master P.
</P>
<P>
   As game time approached, Master P huddled at the bench, then
shoved a stick of gum in his mouth. During the national anthem,
most of the Fury's players clasped their hands behind their backs.
Master P settled for hooking his thumbs over his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 12 minutes of the game, Master P _ 6-foot-4, 195
pounds _ watched from the sidelines. Second quarter, and Coach
Keith Smart pointed him in. Master P took off his warm-up shirt,
revealing biceps with two mammoth tattoos, one featuring a dollar
sign.
</P>
<P>
   He proved to be an aggressive but clumsy player, fouling three
times in his first 2 minutes 12 seconds. He committed three
turnovers with double dribbles and errant passes. On the plus side,
he made one of two free-throw attempts and got a defensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   After eight minutes, Coach Smart pulled him out. He got a pat on
the backside from a teammate, then spent the rest of the game
wearing a Powerade towel on his head. The Connecticut Pride won the
season opener, 119-103.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Papile, director of scouting for the Boston Celtics, was
sitting courtside and delivered a verdict. ``He struggled,'' Papile
said. Master P had raw talent, he said, but no hope of making the
NBA at his age. But Papile said it was admirable, even stunning,
that Master P was able to hold his own among competitors who had
been playing full time for years.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if ``C.T.,'' the Pride's mascot lion,
was going to get more autograph requests. But at the final horn,
about 40 youngsters surrounded Master P, waving tickets, programs,
caps and rap magazines. Resisting the entreaties of a home team
security guard, Master P signed almost every one.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he met a crush of five reporters in the adjutant
general's conference room. He said he had trouble getting the
butterflies out, but still hoped to make the NBA later this season
or maybe next. ``It's time to go to the wall, now,'' he said.

</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: The following text accompanies the weather map for
Sunday, Nov. 15, sent to computer graphics clients of The New York
Times News Service. For information call 212-556-4204.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the unsettled weather Sunday will be confined to the
perimeter of the nation. Dry and comfortably cool conditions will
dominate many areas as high pressure stretches from the lower Ohio
Valley to the Southwest. It will be windy in parts of the northern
states, but mainly calm farther south.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in New Brunswick will circulate chillier air into
the Northeast on brisk northwesterly breezes. Gusts over 30 mph are
likely in New England. A few snow showers will dust the mountains
from Vermont to Maine, but sunshine will return to the coast by
midday.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening disturbance near the Mississippi Delta will supply
moisture to the Southeast, but most of the showers will be confined
to near the Gulf Coast. Warm and humid air will occupy southern
Florida with isolated showers near the shore. Low clouds and fog
along the western Gulf Coast will slowly yield to sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   A new storm developing in the Dakotas will summon a limited
moisture supply into the northeast Plains with thickening clouds.
Light snow will develop from upper Michigan to eastern Montana. A
blustery flow will descend the eastern Rockies and Black Hills with
gusts to 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between polar and Pacific air will be active in the
Northwest. A strong onshore flow will bring rain to the coast and
rising snow levels in the Cascades. Clouds and a few showers will
progress into eastern Washington and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will be bright and warmer while offshore winds in
southern California produce sunshine and milder conditions.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TEXAS WETNESS
</P>
<P>
   Excessive rain and flooding has plagued eastern Texas during the
last few days. A record daily rainfall of 4.68 inches was measured
in Houston on Thursday. A slow-moving jet stream disturbance
intercepting a rich supply of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
fueled the deluge. November can be very wet near the Gulf States.
Jet stream disturbances, which derive their energy from increasing
temperature contrasts between high and low latitudes, are more
common than in summer. Meanwhile, lingering warmth of Gulf waters
provide a source of humid air, which fuels the heavy rain.

IRAQ TAKES STEPS TO QUELL THREAT OF ATTACK BY U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Expands and updates earlier story.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with a possible U.S. military attack,
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq appeared to back down Saturday,
saying in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that his
government would resume full cooperation with international arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-page annex to the letter made clear that Saddam's
interpretation of what he would get in return left ample room for
continued conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The annex _ which Annan's special envoy in Baghdad, Prakash
Shah, said the Iraqis did not want made public _ restates demands
by Iraq that have already been rejected by the United States,
Britain and other Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Iraq wrapped its announcement Saturday in a cloak of
statesmanship. Diplomats here and officials in Washington said that
Saddam, isolated diplomatically by even his friends, apparently
decided to buy time and head off a U.S. attack now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against
Iraq,'' the letter to Annan said, ``but as an expression of our
feeling of responsibility and in response to your appeal and those
of our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reaction from Clinton administration officials as well
as from U.N. weapons inspectors was skeptical. In Washington,
officials said that the United States would press ahead with
preparations for an attack on Iraq. At the United Nations, there
was no urgency attached to returning the arms inspectors, who were
withdrawn from Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very high degree of skepticism about Iraqi
intentions,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's national security team is reviewing the latest
developments in a very prudent and deliberate way and will make a
recommendation on what the appropriate next steps are.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials argued that the Iraqis were not hedging their
decision to resume cooperation, and that the annex to their letter
was no more than a wish list. ``Our understanding is that the annex
to the letter does not constitute conditions,'' said Fred Eckhard,
Annan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The annex is a copy of Iraq's policy points as they were
presented to Russia, China and France on Friday. The policy
summary, mentioned in the public letter but not generally
distributed, was made available to the press by U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   It asks that Baghdad be given direct assurances by the
secretary-general or ``a delegation from the council'' that its
demands be considered.
</P>
<P>
   It also asks that the comprehensive review of relations with the
United Nations ``be carried out within a very short time, (seven
days for example)'' after arms inspectors resume their work. The
United States has already suggested that four to six weeks would be
more realistic, to allow time to see if inspections were really
unfettered.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also wants to shift the burden of evidence to the U.N.
Special Commission, forcing it to prove what Iraq is supposed to be
hiding rather than allowing the commission to continue compelling
Baghdad to produce answers and missing documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis want a timetable _ ``a short period, they say'' _ for
them to take whatever steps are necessary to close files on weapons
programs. Inspectors fear that this will result in the kind of sham
activities like the pro-forma inspection of presidential properties
earlier this year. The Iraqis would then declare they had met all
their obligations and the oil embargo would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The annex again raises questions about the future of Richard
Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, whom Iraq wants dismissed, and of the commission
itself, which Iraq wants to make part of the U.N. system. It is now
a free-standing creation of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also reiterated their preference for a comprehensive
review to be conducted under Annan's direction. The Security
Council has already said that it will run that review.
</P>
<P>
   In their public letter to the secretary-general, the Iraqis said
that the decision to resume cooperation was made at meetings on
Saturday of the president's cabinet and party, chaired by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings followed the receipt of a letter Friday night from
Annan reiterating the secretary-general's warning, in effect, that
Iraq could never hope to have sanctions lifted unless it played by
the rules, and appeals from Russia, China, and France, among
others, the Iraqis said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against recent evidence that ``the goal sought by Iraq
was not to sever the relationship with UNSCOM and the IAEA,'' the
two arms agencies monitoring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of Iraq decided to resume working with the
Special Commission and the IAEA and to allow them to perform their
normal duties,'' the Iraqi letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint that Iraq would back down came early Saturday
from an unnamed Iraqi official in Baghdad. A few hours later, Shah
said publicly that the Iraqis had agreed ``without conditions'' to
resume cooperation, which was broken off by Saddam on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   As Shah spoke, the secretary-general was meeting with Iraq's
representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, at Annan's
official residence in New York. There, Annan took a call from Aziz,
and they discussed the letter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a last-ditch diplomatic gesture by the
secretary-general, backed up by the considerable military might of
the United States and Britain, has at least temporarily averted
attack. Aides to Annan say that they have learned by now that when
Saddam puts himself out on a limb, he needs a fig leaf to cover a
reversal _ or, as some describe it, ``a ladder to climb down on.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general provided that with his trip to Baghdad in
February, when the United States last lined up a force in the
Persian Gulf to attack Iraq. At a news conference in the Iraqi
capital then, Annan made the point, however, that the military
force assembled in the region had made his mission possible, a
message the Iraqis did not really want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Annan made his last-minute appeal to Saddam in a
letter on Friday night, after a meeting with the Security Council
that lasted nearly five hours. The secretary-general, who had
abruptly cut off a trip in North Africa Wednesday to confront the
crisis, said after the marathon session that ``events on the ground
seem to be running away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Iraqi president had been warned by virtually
all his erstwhile friends _ Russia, France, China and the Arab
nations _ that he would take the blame for bringing down U.S.
missiles on his nation and people. Even governments that oppose the
use of force to settle this crisis had made it clear that the
Iraqis were isolated in their defiance this time and could not
count on help from them.
</P>
<P>
   The present crisis with Iraq, which came on the heels of a year
of confrontations, has its roots in a decision by Saddam on Aug. 5
to curtail cooperation with inspectors from UNSCOM, which monitors
biological, chemical and prohibited missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   They and their counterparts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which watched nuclear developments, were forbidden to make
new, on-site searches and were restricted to using existing
monitoring systems _ cameras and air, soil and water samplers _ and
making routine inspection visits to previously agreed sites.
</P>
<P>
   That move set off alarms here for the short as well as long
term, because the Security Council had intended the inspection
system to keep functioning, with unannounced searches, even after
sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, the council responded with a resolution that
ended all further sanctions reviews, and therefore hopes of having
the embargo lifted, until weapons inspections resumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Security Council and the secretary-general
were working on plans for a comprehensive review of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations, going back to the 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, when sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also made demands about how the review should be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, the council laid out its plans for conducting a
review. It did not promise more than a new look at sanctions after
Iraq had met all its disarmament requirements. The next day, Saddam
shocked everyone involved by shutting down the inspection system
entirely. In the face of possible U.S. bombing, all the inspectors
have now been withdrawn from Iraq.

 &HT;    9 minutes, 20 seconds: The crash of ASA Flight 529
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
 &HT;    By Gary M. Pomerantz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ASA Flight 529 was more than three miles high when a
propeller blade broke off its left wing. The Atlantic Southeast
Airlines twin-engine turboprop carrying 29 people shuddered and
fell.
</P>
<P>
   In window seat 2A, a young woman who had served in the Army
thought she'd heard a small cannon explode. She looked out and saw
the propeller declare war on the left wing. She slammed shut her
window shade, frightened by the sight and what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant Robin Fech grabbed the metal kitchen galley to
steady herself. Soda cans trembled. Under her breath, Fech cursed.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh row, a shipyard worker from Maine thought the
plane had hit an air pocket.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer with a New York accent thought they'd struck a bird.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Baltimore schoolteacher in front of him, though she
wondered, What type of bird flies this high? A peregrine falcon,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   A young deputy sheriff had lost track of time and altitude. He
thought the plane had hit a tree or skimmed a mountainside. So
severe was the shudder that his partner next to him, a law
enforcement lifer, grabbed the young deputy's left knee to keep
from falling on him.
</P>
<P>
   Almost reflexively, the flight attendant told passengers, ``This
plane is designed to fly on one engine.'' But in a moment, seeing
the damage, even she didn't believe that.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, the co-pilot thought the propeller separation
sounded like someone had hit a trash can with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane dropped _ dramatically at first, then more
gradually _ the veteran pilot beside him said, ``What the hell's
going on with this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In nine minutes and 20 seconds, the plane would crash. Just
before 1 p.m. on Aug. 21, 1995, ASA Flight 529 would slam through a
grove of pine trees and into a hayfield in Carroll County.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would bounce twice, breaking apart as it went. The
cabin would depressurize and fill with sunlight and humid air. A
fuel-fed fire would break out at 1,800 degrees. Then, unspeakable
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 people aboard, 19 lived to tell about it. In the
telling, survivors almost without exception have asked themselves
the same question about those nine minutes and 20 seconds: Was it
really that long?
</P>
<P>
   At home, that's long enough to walk around the block or load the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   But how long is it when your plane is falling?
</P>
<P>
   Long enough to fill the passenger cabin with the quiet of
judgment day.
</P>
<P>
   They sat three across in narrow seats with thin backs, each row
containing a single seat to the left of the aisle and two to the
right. They rode in a tube, claustrophobic to some, 10 rows in all.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit door to row 10 in back was 31 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That tight space contained 27 lives, full and varied: Catholic,
Baptist, Metjodist, Jewish, atheist, white, black, Asian, never
married, once divorced, twice divorced. The passengers of Flight
529 had 18 spouses, 41 children and more than two dozen
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was bound from Atlanta to Gulfport, Miss. Passengers'
destinations included a grocery store in Mobile, Ala., a hospital
in Jackson, Miss., a chemical plant in Muscle Shoals, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   There were two deputy sheriffs from ViRginia en route to
retrieve a fugitive. A federal prosecutor investigating riverboat
gambling in Gulfport. A New Orleans woman returning home after
interviewing for a job as an ASA flight attendant. An 18-year-old
airman heading for his first assignment in Biloxi. A young
Mississippi minister coming back after giving a trial sermon that
had wowed a Midwest congregation.
</P>
<P>
   With them was a crew of three: a divorced 37-year-old flight
attendant working long hours for $20,000 a year; a young,
self-confident first officer from California who was five months
into his childhood dream"of being a commercial pilot; and the
captain, a seven-year veteran at ASA who loved flying the
high-performance Brazilian-made plane, once telling his wife, ``I
think I can get one down in a field somewhere if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   A few passengers had expected to be on a jet, not a turboprop.
Some had even thought they were flying Delta, only to be told ASA
was ``the Delta Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping aboard en route to a family get-together in
Mississippi, Baltimore teacher Dawn Dumm and her 64-year-old motier
took two front-row seats. Neither liked the feel of the tiny
Brasilia. Dumm thought the carpet and seat coverings looked worn,
like those on a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm had become more careful after a series of personal
tragedies, including her father's cancer death and heart surgery
for an infant child. The common theme, she decided, was that she
had had no control over these things. A devout Catholic, she now
collected decorative angels.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm once heard a travel expert say that synthetic material
burns into your skin in a fire whereas cotton burns away from it.
On this trip, she wore clothes made of cotton, as did her mother,
Mary Jean Adair. In an emergency, they would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   To her family, Adair had a sixth sdnse, an uncanny ability to
know when things weren't right. To Adair, this plane did not feel
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this at all,'' she told her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think of it as an adventure'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, still at the airport, an overhead light panel
came loose in the fifth row. A mechanic came aboard to reattach the
unit. Asked if he had fixed it, the mechanic told flight attendant
Fech, ``I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Adair asked her daughter: ``Don't you think we
should get off?''
</P>
<P>
   9:20 to impact. When the blade broke in the clouds 20 minutes
after takeoff, ASA Flight 529 was climbing past 18,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Brasilia yawed and fell sharply to the left. A cup of apple
juice spilled at the feet of Angela Brumfield, the aspiring flight
attendant in the second row. Passengers napping in the second,
fourth and sixth rows shot up in their seats. In the third and
seventh rows, one man reading a golf magazine and another a novel
about Vietnam instinctively turned left toward the noise.
</P>
<P>
   The plane fell nearly 4,000 feet in the next minute.
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the left engine _ a noise reassuring in its
steadiness _ suddenly quieted. The right engine whined louder.
</P>
<P>
   For 33 seconds, the aircraft shook, at times violently.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers focused on what had happened to the left engine. Once
sleek, it now seemed a junk pile. The metal covering of the engine
had ripped apart and peeled back, exposing the machinery's guts.
Wires flapped in the winds. Hydraulic fluid, oil and jet fuel
poured into the airstream.
</P>
<P>
   Phe propeller unit was not where it was supposed to be. Three of
the four propeller blades had been blown out of position by several
feet and now were lodgedool two hours a month. The difference in
what her two children learned in kindergarten has convinced Ella
Lawrence that Edison offers a better education than a regular Flint
school.
</P>
<P>
   Both children learned their ABCs, but James, a 6-year-old who
went to an Edison school in kindergarten, could recognize letters
out of order; his sister Rae, a 10-year-old who went to a
traditional public school for kindergarten, couldn't do that. Both
children learned to count in kindergarten, but James was taught in
kindergarten to count to 100 by ones, twos, fives and 10s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals here are higher,'' Lawrence said of the Edison
school. ``They are cramming sense into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint school Superintendent James Ray said he is philosophically
opposed to diverting tax dollars from public school systems. But
Flint experienced a steady student population drop from its peak of
47,000 in the late 1960s to its current 25,000, due to ``white
flight'' and General Motors' downsizing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ray said, he's a realist: Flint needed Edison. ``I
had to provide options for enough parents to hold (them) while we
rebuild the system,'' he said. Flint has been pleased with
standardized test scores at its two Edison schools, but other
cities have seen little difference after Edison took over. In
Miami, Edison school test scores still lag the district and
statewide averages, although scores for most grades are moving up.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the number of Williams-Edison's fourth-graders
scoring ``satisfactory'' in reading and math rose during Edison's
first year, but fifth-graders dropped in both science and writing
after Edison took over. On all four tests, Williams-Edison's
performance lags the overall Flint school district.
</P>
<P>
   Asa Hilliard III, a Georgia State University professor of urban
education, was ``flabbergasted'' when he learned that Atlanta was
considering education management firms. He responded with a paper
entitled ``Falling for the Big Trick,'' which likens the companies
to health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Edison has no high quality product to sell,''
Hilliard wrote. ``They are selling hopes and promises.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Chubb, Edison's head of curriculum, said the company's
review of 100 norm-based tests taken by students show that scores
increased in 86 cases and fell or held steady in 14 cases.
``Critics could say some of the schools have done well and some of
the schools have not done as well,'' Chubb said. ``I don't think
there is any fair way to say (Edison students' achievement) is not
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, hiring an education management company is tantamount to a
school system abdicating its sole responsibility to educate
children, said Alex Molnar, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
education professor and author of a book critical of education
management firms. ``What are you paying the superintendent for?''
Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, Hilliard and others have questioned why public school
systems can't do what Edison does _ which Chubb likens to asking
why school systems don't make their own pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison model _ including the curriculum, technology,
professional development, research, support, assessment,
after-school programs and community resource personnel _ is too
expensive and time-consuming for a school system to implement,
especially for a few schools, Chubb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You contract with us, we can do a small number of schools in
one place economically,'' he said. Whittle started Edison in 1991
with the ambitious goal of opening 1,000 private, for-profit
schools, but financial problems forced the company to change its
focus to operating public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Edison officials say they took some of the best practices in
public and private education and packaged them into a uniform
curriculum taught at all schools. The company enters into five-year
contracts that lay out specific performance objectives the school
is to reach. The schools are open to everyone, including special
education students, with students in the school's attendance zone
usually given first priority, and any leftover space filled by
lottery. Edison charter schools _ which don't have attendance zones
_ are filled entirely by lottery. So far, company officials say, no
school system has pulled out of a contract with Edison _ although
San Francisco could break that streak. In Lansing, where Edison
operates the Mid-Michigan Academy charter school, teachers last
year unsuccessfully tried to unionize over complaints that included
long hours without pay, said Bob Harris, public education advocate
of the Michigan Education Association, the union representing
Michigan teachers. ``We had some unhappy teachers last year, but
that was their first year,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   MEA opposes privatization of public school, as do the National
Educational Association and the American Federation of Teachers.
After Edison's first year at Miami's Henry Reeves Elementary
School, there was a movement to throw the company out after test
scores fell and the principal and several teachers quit. But the
district decided to give the company a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores still fall below the district and statewide
averages, but for most grades the scores are improving _ considered
a significant achievement for a school filled with low-income and
immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   The company's troubles are growing pains as they fine-tune the
curriculum and correct problems as they arise, said Deborah
McGriff, an Edison executive vice president and a former
superintendent of Detroit Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone in any field who has created major change
without some controversy, some challenges,'' she said. ``The issue
is not whether you were able to do this perfectly. The issue is how
do you respond when there are challenges.'' Atlanta developer Tom
Cousins' East Lake Foundation is pushing for Edison. He envisions
the Atlanta school system hiring Edison to run the vacant Drew
Elementary School, which was closed because of declining
enrollment. Drew is in the housing development being built by
Cousins and the Atlanta Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``To successfully redevelop the East Lake community, it is
essential to have a high-quality public school to attract new
residents to the community and provide the best education
possible,'' said Greg Giornelli, executive director of Cousins'
foundation. ``We have become a very big champion of Edison.''
</P>
<P>
   But Muhammad and other board members have reservations. ``I get
very nervous when we talk about giving our sole responsibility for
existing to someone else,'' Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie Dennard, the board's student and staff performance
committee chairwoman, said education management companies don't sit
well with her, either. Still, the system has to consider them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all focused on, `Is this a strategy for improving student
performance?' because this is ultimately the only reason for
considering this,'' Dennard said. ``You can't be afraid to look at,
touch and see something different.''

 &HT;    Gingrich wraps up his official duties
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in the mid-1980s, well before he was House
speaker, Newt Gingrich used to take long walks around the National
Mall, the great public square that ties together all of
Washington's grand monuments. The walks, which became less frequent
with his rise to power, helped relieve bouts of early morning
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never get further than the Washington Monument without
becoming an optimist,'' Gingrich said last week. ``I would argue to
anybody in this city, if you just get out and walk down the Mall
you would be a healthier human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich left his office twice to walk the Mall, once
with a close aide and once with his wife, Marianne. The walks, he
said, were dedicated to thinking about ``the future, thinking about
how I'm going to organize my life for the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, is already moving on. He remains on the job until
the new Congress formally elects a new speaker Jan. 6. But Gingrich
already has become speaker in name only. This past week, beginning
with his return to Washington after the Nov. 3 elections and ending
with an address to new members, was effectively his last in power.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's power began slipping the instant he announced 10 days
ago that he would not stand for re-election as speaker and would
resign the House seat he has held since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gingrich arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday to a
bittersweet welcome party organized by staff, House Republicans
already had shifted their allegiance to Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-La.), the lanky chairman of the House Appropriations Committee
who will be named speaker by his colleagues on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members proclaimed their affection with posters saying,
``I love Newt.'' Across America, the post-election issue of
Newsweek hit newsstands, featuring a vaguely anguished close-up of
Gingrich and captioned simply, ``The Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which power shifts in Washington is both
breathtaking and cruel. In Livingston's office adjacent to the
Capitol, it was standing room only as reporters, lobbyists and
staff competed to get Livingston's attention. Members trying to
reach Livingston by phone got constant busy signals and were forced
to walk to his office to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston emerged from a meeting with Gingrich Tuesday
afternoon, noting there were ``just a jillion tasks, a jillion
things to do.'' In contrast, Gingrich's office was quiet most of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries to Gingrich's press office, which typically average
100 to 150 calls a day, dropped to fewer than 30. There were no
events to plan, no agenda to set. Gingrich himself was busy
planning his private, not public, life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the reality of this town,'' said Robert Walker, a former
House member from Pennsylvania and a close friend of Gingrich's.
``This town flows toward power.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategy for a new life
</P>
<P>
   For Gingrich, the emotional high of last week may have been
Monday night when he addressed the biggest contributors of GOPAC,
the political action committee he once led and the vehicle of his
accession to power. The ovations were frequent and thunderous, even
though the remarks themselves were little changed from his stock
campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich seemed as if a ``great burden had been lifted from his
shoulders,'' said Matt Glavin, director of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation in Atlanta, who spoke to Gingrich the night he announced
that he would not run for speaker and who was present at the Monday
dinner speech.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment of the evening came not from what Gingrich
said, but from what he did. Before the speech, he embraced
Livingston warmly, conferring his blessing on the next speaker for
all to see.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, Gingrich's staff member were already adjusting to
their new roles. Gingrich himself set the tone, coming in to work
after lunch with Marianne and daughters Jackie Sue Cushman and
Kathy Gingrich-Lubbers at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a Washington
institution near the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich padded around his office, appearing unhurried and
relaxed. Midafternoon he bumped into Casey Weldon, the third-string
quarterback for the Washington Redskins, who was getting a tour of
the Capitol. The Redskins, 1-8 for the season, are having their
most disastrous year of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to hang in there, that it's been a rough year for
all of us,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gingrich met with Livingston for more than an hour, the
first formal meeting between the two men since Livingston announced
he would run for speaker the Friday after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just couldn't be more gracious and helpful,'' Livingston
said. Gingrich was already ``strategizing his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich doesn't think small thoughts,'' Livingston said.
``He thinks large and wide. He's an incredibly gifted person.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne popped in and out of Gingrich's office all day Tuesday,
appearing positively serene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes occur,'' she said. ``You say, `OK, what next?' We
weren't expecting this, but now this is an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who Gingrich once hoped would be his majority whip
instead of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), ate dinner with the Gingriches
Wednesday night at the Capital Grille, another Washington
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never known him to be happier, and I certainly have
never known Marianne to be happier,'' Walker said. ``This is going
to give them an opportunity to plan their lives together in ways
that are going to be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich hasn't said specifically what he will do when
he leaves office, Walker and others are betting that he will take
his place on the lucrative lecture circuit. The occupation will
continue to give Gingrich visibility, and allow him to discuss
ideas without the chore of trying to translate them into
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be one of the hottest names on the lecture circuit for
some time to come,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   King of a different hill
</P>
<P>
   Mel Steely, an old buddy of Gingrich's from West Georgia
College, dropped in to see the speaker last week and also wasn't
surprised to find Gingrich in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still king of the hill, it's just a different hill,''
Steely said. ``In Newt's mind, he's always king of the hill. That's
what you guys don't understand about him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gingrich received some retirement advice from
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be around a while,'' Dole said, leaving Gingrich's
office. ``At 55, he's got a lot ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich wasn't getting much attention inside the Capitol
last week, outside the building was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   When he took his late afternoon walk around the Mall Wednesday
with Steve Wesbrook, his operations manager, Gingrich was
recognized by virtually everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Striding past the National Gallery of Art, Gingrich shook the
outstretched hand of a tourist who said, ``Nice to see you, Mr.
Speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of Gingrich's earshot, an associate of the tourist turned to
his walking partner and said, ``Nice to see you? Nice to see you
go!''
</P>
<P>
   More typical was the response of Joe Domenico, who wanted his
picture taken with Gingrich. ``Thank you for everything,'' Domenico
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln Memorial, Gingrich was nearly tackled by a
breathless student from the University of Maryland who said she was
studying Gingrich in college. Holding a copy of ``To Renew
America,'' Gingrich's 1995 book, the woman begged Gingrich to sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a library book,'' Gingrich exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know,'' said Rebekah Mayer. ``I'm going to buy it
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Rebekah, you have to buy this book,'' Gingrich said after
signing it. ``I don't want to hear later that you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich walked the Mall again Thursday, this time with
Marianne. Holding hands, fewer people seemed to notice the speaker,
who was dressed in black slacks, white shoes and brown leather
jacket. ``Good luck, Newt!'' shouted a man from a passing car, his
fist clenched.
</P>
<P>
   Before he returned to Georgia on Friday, Gingrich performed
perhaps his most meaningful official duty of the week, giving the
opening greeting to the 40 newly elected members of the House at
freshmen orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the official welcome, Gingrich breakfasted with the
freshmen members in the ``family room,'' a large wood-paneled room
just off the House floor reserved for members and their guests.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast, Gingrich told the new members that service in
the House was a strain on home life, and he urged them to make a
special effort to spend time with their families. He told them that
House service was an honor, but that they should also have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois state Rep. Judy Biggert, a Republican elected from the
Chicago suburbs, recalled how Gingrich had come to her district
before the election and energized her supporters ``by what he had
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's remarks Friday were inspirational, Biggert said, but
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of bittersweet,'' she said as she hurried into her
first orientation meeting. ``I think he will be really missed.

 &HT;    House officers at a glance
 &HT;    By Julia Malone
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are descriptions of the major leadership posts
Republican House members will fill at their Wednesday
organizational meeting.
</P>
<P>
   These duties often shift slightly from one Congress to another,
depending on the personalities and experience of the people who
hold the jobs. But the general responsibilities are shaped by
decades of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's salary is $175,000 and the majority leader's is
$151,800. All other leaders receive the standard House member's
pay, $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKER
</P>
<P>
   The only House officer mentioned in the Constitution, the
speaker presides over the floor proceedings, controls the
legislative agenda, recognizes speakers in debates, and has a major
role in appointing committees and chairmen. The speaker _ who need
not to be a member of Congress _ also stands third in line for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will pick their nominee for the post Wednesday, but
the final vote takes place after the full House convenes Jan. 6.
The vote for speaker is generally cast along party lines, a
practice that has guaranteed that the majority party controls the
speakership.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidate: Robert Livingston (R-La.)
</P>
<P>
   MAJORITY LEADER
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by the majority party in the House, this top assistant to
the speaker carries much of the day-to-day responsibility for
scheduling, managing and promoting the party's legislation on the
House floor. He or she also acts as a primary public spokesman for
party positions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidates: Dick Armey (R-Texas, the incumbent); Steve Largent
(R-Okla.); Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.)
</P>
<P>
   MAJORITY WHIP
</P>
<P>
   The job of the whip is to keep track of support for major
legislative issues and to make sure party members are present for
close votes. The whip is assisted by scores of deputies and
assistants who constantly count votes and lobby party members to
vote for bills strongly backed by the House leadership. However,
the whip has no formal powers to require party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the post comes from ``whipper-in,'' a British
hunting term for the person who keeps foxhounds from leaving the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidate: Tom DeLay (R-Texas, the incumbent)
</P>
<P>
   CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   This post calls for keeping the House Republican membership,
known as the party conference, up to date on provisions of
legislation coming to the floor. The conference sets party rules,
builds unity through retreats and other meetings, sends out
research on major issues, and faxes news releases to the news media
giving the party's views.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidates: John Boehner (R-Ohio, the incumbent); J.C. Watts
(R-Okla.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   A key figure in election efforts, this official has the job of
raising campaign funds and distributing them, chiefly on behalf of
the party's incumbents. The campaign chairman puts candidates in
touch with a network of political action committees from various
business and special interests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidates: John Linder (R-Ga., the incumbent); Thomas Davis
(R-Va.)

 &HT;    Linder remains in the line of fire
 &HT;    WITH LEADERS
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The door remains open in John Linder's office at
the National Republican Congressional Committee. He continues to
take reporters' telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   He answered viewers' questions live on C-SPAN the other morning,
then addressed a group of Republican campaign consultants, not your
happiest campers since Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Linder has not chosen the path of avoidance since the election
and its surprising outcome _ five fewer Republican seats in the
next House of Representatives than in the current one. Other
Republican leaders have stopped talking to the media as they work
to save their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, most directly in the line of fire because his job was to
recruit candidates, then make sure they won, has taken on his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a single candidate in America who lost for lack
of money,'' Linder said. ``The turnout effort was there. It came
down to the fact that our candidates didn't have anything to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Message was the province of Speaker Newt Gingrich, who also
appointed Linder chairman of the NRCC after the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is out of a job, having chosen to retire from Congress,
and Linder is in a fight for his political post without the backing
of his longtime friend and political mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The first concession Gingrich made after the election is that
the speaker would no longer appoint the NRCC chairman. Instead, the
post would be elected.
</P>
<P>
   That change set up a challenge to Linder from Rep. Tom Davis of
Virginia, who is unwilling to let Linder off the hook without
taking some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   A Midwesterner like Linder, Davis represents a suburban
Washington district. Although he was elected in the Republican
revolution class of 1994, Davis is a moderate. He also is a
ferocious fund-raiser, perhaps the leading requirement for the NRCC
job.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Republican consultants, Davis agreed with Linder
that Republicans failed to control the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But he faulted Linder on two counts. He complained that the NRCC
did not put enough money into voter turnout efforts, and he also
criticized the final round of ads from the NRCC, including several
that made reference to President Clinton's sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly lost among some of our base who felt we mishandled
that,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder denied that those ads made a difference, arguing that
fewer than 40 percent of the voters were aware of them and only a
small fraction said it influenced their vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Linder said the NRCC's overall ad campaign, the $26 million
Operation Breakout, prevented a Republican disaster at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Texan could swing votes
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has the backing of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, the third-ranking Republican and the only GOP leader whose
job is not threatened. DeLay is a master vote counter who also is
working against Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas and Rep.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), the Republican Conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If things go DeLay's way when Republicans elect their new
leadership team this week, he will be the only experienced hand
left and in an enhanced position of influence.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario was not one many people envisioned before Nov. 3.
But the first two weeks of November did not go the way Linder had
hoped. There was no satisfaction, no rest in the wake of victory,
no strategy session about what to do next year with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   No, the first post-election conversation between Gingrich and
Linder, two Georgia pols who helped build the Republican Party in
the state, went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said someone would have to pay for the soured election.
The someone either would be Linder or Joe Gaylord, the close
Gingrich political adviser who is on the NRCC payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he was inclined to protect Gaylord.
</P>
<P>
   The next conversation took place a few days later. Gingrich
wanted to know if Linder had, in fact, said that Gingrich liked to
blame others, including his wife, when things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said he had indeed uttered those words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurt that I had said it,'' Linder said. ``I told him I
should not have talked about (his wife) Marianne.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the situation confronting Linder is that every
person who will vote this week on whether to give him another two
years at the head of the NRCC won an election Nov. 3, many with
help from Linder's committee.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the incumbents groused when Linder and Gingrich
asked them to give to the NRCC's advertising campaign. And Linder
is the first to admit that he does not excel at the glad-handing
that many politicians consider a crucial element in wooing voters,
be they the general public or congressional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Linder carries the additional burden of leading a losing team in
a year that was supposed to have been very good for Republicans.
Whether the outcome was his fault is almost beside the point. In
this city's relentless use of sports metaphors, several analysts
have compared Linder to the coach of a losing ball club who may be
fired even if he did not make the mistakes that cost his team some
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uphill battle,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   As he surveyed the field for the coming week, Linder said his
best opportunity is to pick up the support of conservatives who,
while unhappy with Gingrich's team, may be wary of installing a
moderate such as Davis in a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York had to
reassure moderates that Linder would not apply litmus tests in
recruiting and supporting candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's stands on social issues are more conservative than
Davis', although Linder subordinated his personal views the past
two years as part of the GOP's efforts to broaden its reach.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Linder will commence another frenzied round of
raising money and seeking out good candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, ``I'll have a lot of time on my hands.

 &HT;    Miami's experiment with privately run school shows improvement
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Macdaleine St. Remy's hand shoots up and she squirms in
her seat when asked what she likes about attending Henry E.S.
Reeves Elementary, Miami-Dade County's experiment with a privately
managed school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the computers we get to take home because, when I have
a project, I can type it up and print it out,'' the fourth-grader
says. ``And this school is so much harder. In my old school we
would read for 10 minutes and go out and play, then do math for 10
minutes and go out and play. We're learning more here.''
</P>
<P>
   After a difficult first year and a smoother second year, this
sprawling urban district's five-year contract with entrepreneur
Chris Whittle's Edison Project seems to be hitting stride as it
approaches the midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores still lag below the district and statewide averages,
but scores for most grades are moving up. Parents and teachers
praise the school, and the 1,200 children seem excited and
committed, though the school day lasts longer and the school year
stretches into what used to be their summer vacation. Reeves'
students stay for an extra 80 minutes each day and an extra four
weeks each year than their peers in Dade County's non-Edison
schools. ``We have a wealth of resources available and the parents,
teachers and students are all taking stock in making it work,''
Elani Pennant, who teaches fifth grade and coordinates social
studies instruction, said. ``I taught in the regular public schools
and this is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the verdict after Reeves' first year under the
Edison contract.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores foundered; the principal was replaced; and about
one-third of the teachers left, complaining that they were
underpaid and overworked. There was even grumbling at district
headquarters that perhaps the contract with Edison should be
terminated early.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Reeves' test scores are coming up, if slowly. The school
raised its scores on the Florida Writes test from 2.3 in 1996 to
2.7 in 1998, still lower than the district average of 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only our third year,'' Gladys Ruenes, the school's
reading coordinator, said. ``Some people are saying, `It's already
your third year,' but it takes time. We need the five years before
we can make an honest judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the single most visible difference between Reeves and
other Dade schools is the computers. Edison has put the machines in
every classroom and sent one home with each student. Parents are
given special training so they can help the kids _ and most need
it. Many of the lower-income families could not afford a computer
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted one but wasn't able to get one,'' said Jocelyn
Nicoleau, who has two children at Reeves. ``It really makes a
difference. The kids use the computers all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Students research projects, do homework and play educational
games on the machines. Parents swap e-mail with teachers, and
teachers send memos home via the machines, as well as lesson plans
and grades. There are also in-school and Edison-wide networks where
teachers, students and parents share ideas, insights and problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also praise the school because it gives them more input
into decision-making and more professional development. Edison has
paid to send several teachers to conferences and seminars _ a rare
opportunity in the public system.
</P>
<P>
   The company also just announced a stock-option plan for Reeves
teachers, in which they will be able to buy shares at a discount.
Company officials say they would make options available to any
Edison school that requests them. Both teachers and parents credit
Reeves Principal Diane Dyes-Paschal with Reeves' turnaround after
its difficult first year. A former county Principal of the Year,
Paschal seems convinced the experiment in private management will
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the autonomy,'' she said. ``I have much more say over
my budget. My teachers work hard and the students do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasmine Rolle, a fourth-grader at Reeves, would attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a private school and we didn't have all these
special areas in art and music,'' Jasmine saids. ``And the teachers
weren't that hard on you. Here, the teachers are hard on you, but
that's good. It makes you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Paschal has no excuse if her teachers don't work hard: Unlike in
traditional public schools, she has complete control over the
hiring of her staff. She takes applications and hires only those
she deems the best and hardest-working.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have an administrator that trusts the teachers,''
said Green, of the Dade teachers union. ``Here we have teachers
involved with the decisions, working with the administrator.
Edison's philosophy is to share the leadership.''

 &HT;    Can billions of kids be educated at a profit?
 &HT;    By Rochelle Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Edison Project wants to be the McDonald's of the
for-profit education management industry _ a big player in its
field, offering a popular product to public school students.
</P>
<P>
   The fare Edison offers, however, is fine dining not tasted by
most kids in public schools: All Edison students get a $1,200 home
computer, daily Spanish lessons, and 90 minutes daily of reading,
math, music and art.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City-based company says it can provide those
amenities, better educate children, and make a profit. And all for
the same tax dollars paid to educate children in the public schools
many people believe are failing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison method of school finance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Since its inception in 1991, Edison has raised $162 million
from venture capitalists _ investors who pump money into new
companies in exchange for a share of the business before it is
publicly traded on the stock market. That money financed $40
million in research and development between 1991 and 1995, when the
first schools opened, and provides start-up funding for new Edison
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edison negotiates salaries with unions when it contracts with
school systems. Edison school employees _ who remain school system
employees _ are paid more than their colleagues at non-Edison
schools because they work more hours and days per year. For
example, Edison-Perdue Academy teachers make 10.8 percent more than
their Pontiac, Mich., school district counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edison receives the tax dollars allocated for each student _
from $4,000 to $8,000, depending on the U.S. region _ to cover
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edison invests about $1.5 million in each school for teacher
training, building upgrades, wiring, instructional materials and
for computers, telephones and television monitors installed in each
class.
</P>
<P>
   _ The principal of an Edison school is the site-based manager
and his leadership team includes a budget manager. The principal
and budget manager pay all operating costs for the school,
including teacher salaries, cafeteria food, and building utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Edison's business plan calls for it to eventually send 90 cents
on the dollar to each school to pay salaries and expenses. About 5
cents stays in New York to cover central office operations. The
remainder is profit _ 4 to 6 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has not made a dime, but expects to break
even when it has 75 schools, Chris Cerf, legal counsel for the
company, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Molnar, a professor of education at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and frequent critic of education management
firms, sees no way for the schools to generate enough money to
repay investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edison is not going to have access to that capital for long''
because venture capitalists are ``not exactly a milk of human
kindness group,'' Molnar said. ``They are lending high-risk money
in hopes of large returns. Basically, if you gave a school
superintendent a charge card with a two-year float, the
superintendent could do the same thing. But eventually the bills
will come due.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison's investors won't get any money until the company is
publicly traded _ an event expected to take place in two to three
years, Cerf said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, schools like the Williams-Edison Partnership School in
Flint, Mich., are showing a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Edison will have $4.6 million in operating revenue in
1998-99, according to its budget. Operating expenses total $4.2
million. But instead of showing a profit, Edison will have to
contribute additional funds to Williams-Edison to balance its
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit _ $391,501 _ is from repaying Edison's $1.9 million
start-up investment in the school, plus finance charges, over five
years.

   Her clientele sums up the inhabitants of the Sixth. ``You don't
see the Buckhead single people,'' said Moon, 35, who manages the
family-owned shop on Roswell Road in Cobb County. Most of her
customers want the same thing out of life: Good schools, low crime,
low taxes. ``They want their children learning _ not necessarily
the finer things in life. They want them to learn what's right and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As candidates line up to replace Gingrich in one of the
country's most reliably Republican districts, they'll find
themselves talking to people like Moon, a mother of two originally
from Ohio and a self-described baseball mom.
</P>
<P>
   The national media that swoop into Atlanta's northern suburbs to
chronicle the event will find endless ribbons of asphalt that lead
to mazes of office parks occupied by workers who come from a vast
sea of swim-tennis subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   They'll find homes where cell phones and computers are as
indispensable as the bedtime story or good-night kiss. Of the
country's 435 congressional districts, they'll find the
23rd-richest here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strip shopping followed by 200 to 300 units of housing,
then a high school, then a church, then you repeat the process,''
said Allan Lipsett, Gingrich's former district spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to stereotype the Sixth as a homogenous band of
conservatism made up of lock-stepping Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the fissures that split the Republican Party on a
national level can be found right here, in the home of Gingrich the
Republican revolutionary, and Gingrich the more moderate House
Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatism is big here, like the churches.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other forces at work as well. Residents of the
Sixth are often newcomers to Georgia or the South. Some of the new
age carpetbaggers work for giants like Coke, UPS and
Hewlett-Packard while others come to make it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Half the registered voters in Alpharetta didn't live in Georgia
five years ago, said GOP pollster Whit Ayres. Often they're not
from the South. By 2000, the population of Cobb County _ Gingrich's
home and the district's core _ will be about 600,000, an increase
of about 50 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of voters in the Sixth have a college degree.
Education and mobility combine to create an entrepreneurial spirit
addressed by Gingrich in nearly every speech he made at home.
</P>
<P>
   It unifies the district, which cuts through Cobb, Cherokee,
Gwinnett and north Fulton counties. People in small business, like
Moon, want less government. They expect the same commitment from
the next congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In Roswell, the new headquarters of food franchiser Heavenly
Hams is a small, start-up symbol of the American dream. The
company's apple-red, aluminum sign was just installed Thursday. The
office smells of new furniture. Senior vice president Wade Brannon
and partners have been working out of the 30,000-square-foot
building almost a month, even though uninstalled insulation stands
outside some offices and crews work to finish building rental
space.
</P>
<P>
   When the company moved from Hilton Head, S.C., to Atlanta, the
partners chose Roswell because of its small-town feel and access to
successful schools. ``It was as much a lifestyle choice as a
business choice,'' said Brannon, 37, who has seen the business grow
from $1 million of sales 14 years ago to $65 million a year now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Phoenix, Ariz., native Victoria Braden began selling
health insurance out of her husband's small financial services
company in Peachtree Corners. She finds plans for businesses with
fewer than 100 people. She knows the pain of small business, having
just made sure her payroll tax was paid last week. She was drawn to
Gingrich's push for smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my area, people believe that you get what you work for,''
said Braden, who has a 13-year-old boy. ``When I go inside the
Perimeter, there's an expectation that things are owed to the
worker.''
</P>
<P>
   But something irks Braden, the same something that's been
tearing at the GOP since Pat Robertson made his bid for president
in the 1980s: The steadfast rejection of moderate candidates who
don't pass muster by the Christian Coalition. The first litmus test
is opposition to abortion. ``Abortion doesn't even belong in the
debate,'' said Braden, 43. ``When you make that a core of what you
vote around, you'll never have a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The schism has been felt in the Sixth District GOP, and led to
the defeat of Johnny Isakson _ whom Gingrich says is the man to
replace him _ in the 1996 Republican U.S. Senate runoff. That race
was won by Christian conservative Guy Millner. (Isakson, however,
did quite well in the Sixth District, which includes his home
county of Cobb.)
</P>
<P>
   The split rips at voters like Tad Leithead, a Cobb County real
estate developer, former chairman of the chamber of commerce, and
big-money contributor to Gingrich. Unable to accept Christian
politics over the lower-taxes, smaller government message he
favors, Leithead finds himself evolving into more of a Libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich is very, very strong in his district because
we're almost willing to overlook his embracing the Religious Right
(as) politically expedient,'' said Leithead, who moved to Atlanta
from Connecticut when he was 6. ``A lot of people feel
disenfranchised by the Republican Party _ and I'm one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, Cobb County has made grand displays of its
social conservative streak. In the early 1980s, Kennesaw passed an
ordinance requiring homeowners to own a gun. The ordinance remains
on the books but is not enforced. In a 1993 vote that caused a
national stir, the county commission passed a resolution condemning
``the gay lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   But other things are important _ often more so _ to Sixth
District voters. In a 1996 Journal-Constitution/WSB-TV poll, more
than half of the district's voters surveyed called themselves
Republicans. But 45 percent classified themselves as moderates,
while 43 percent as conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideologically, people know Cobb is conservative. But like
Gordon Wysong (the commissioner who authored the anti-gay opinion
and was ousted this year), those who are beyond conservative will
not last,'' said Beth Shipp, a political consultant who helped
Democrat Michael Coles wage a credible but unsuccessful bid to
unseat Gingrich in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Sixth have been gaining control of northern
since the late 1970s, and their leadership _ like Gingrich _ has
found that governing sometimes demands ideological adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   With the astounding population growth of north metro Atlanta has
come tremendous transportation problems. Local government leaders
in the Sixth District, nearly Republican to a person, are the ones
at the forefront of an effort to create a suburban rail system _
with whatever help can be got from big government in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of growth has also made environmentalism a very
Republican issue in the Sixth. One of Gingrich's last acts as
congressman was ensuring the expansion of park land along the
Chattahoochee River.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherokee County, considered more conservative than Cobb,
voters threw out a developer-friendly Republican commission
chairman in favor of a GOP housewife who promised restrained
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Cobb voters rejected the proposed extension
of a transportation sales tax. County Commission Chairman Bill
Byrne framed the loss as opposition to further development. But
Leithead, the former chamber president, said it was an anti-tax
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy ballot included tax breaks for the elderly, veterans
and churches. ``People got to the last thing, a $263 million tax
for roads, and they knee-jerked,'' Leithead said.
</P>
<P>
   While they knee-jerked on the tax issue, voters in Cobb and the
rest of the Sixth returned Newt Gingrich to office with 71 percent
of the vote _ a sign that they were more comfortable with the
Speaker than most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri Wallis will miss him. Her business is on Roswell Road in
Cobb, a place cluttered with Blockbusters, Dunkin' Donuts and
places that will change your oil as fast as your can order a Big
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   She finds serenity in her office of the Primose Country Day
School _ until parents arrive in a mad rush to pick up their kids.
Her working families typically make at least $75,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of cinnamon fills the air. A basket of apples and a
silver pot of coffee sit on a table.''We wanted it to be like it
was dropping their kids off at grandmother's house,'' said Wallis,
51, mother of two grown children.
</P>
<P>
   The East Point native split her ballot Nov. 3, siding with
Republican Guy Millner for governor but voting for Democrat Mark
Taylor as lieutenant governor. Wallis, the wife of a Baptist
minister, is a Republican who wants ``clean living'' _ even if it
means occasionally voting for a Democrat. ``I look for things,''
Wallis said,''that are best for my children and my country.''

 &HT;    Southern conference explores progress in race relations
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Perhaps, just perhaps, Southerners can go
home again, a second chance to find the elusive ``Good South'' of
their dreams. If so, they will surely have to pass this way again,
this place where those dreams wilted in the searing heat of
terrifying social upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   They have all been here before, of course. They have spent
nearly a third of this century trying to make some sense of this
city, this powerful symbol of the worst and best in them.
</P>
<P>
   This ``unfinished business'' has drawn hundreds of Southerners
to Birmingham this weekend. They are here to make peace with the
South's troubled past, to celebrate its upbeat present and to begin
the daunting task of shaping a future free of the racism that is
the dark heart of its politics, economics and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way around Birmingham,'' Southern historian John
Egerton writes in a 32-page report to the delegates to the
three-day ``Unfinished Business'' summit, which begins today. ``We
have to go into it, become a part of it, make our peace with it, in
order to find the way to the Good South of our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit is the work of the Center for the Study of the
American South, which is based in North Carolina, and the
Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, with funding from 19
foundations. It is the culmination of two years of local forums
across the South, all striving for solutions to the racism, poverty
and inequality of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates represent a cross section of cultural, social and
economic backgrounds and not just politicians and recognized civil
rights leaders. The agenda is nothing less than ``to lift the level
of life'' in the South and ``to define anew, in egalitarian terms,
what it means to be a Southerner and (ultimately) an American,''
according to Egerton.
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished business
</P>
<P>
   The model for this summit is the 1938 Southern Conference for
Human Welfare, an assembly of 1,500 Southerners, black and white,
trying to make the region richer, healthier, better educated, less
violent and more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 1938 gathering ended in police threats to arrest
the racially mixed group for violating segregation ordinances, the
1998 gathering will be welcomed by Richard Arrington, the black man
who has been Birmingham's mayor for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The police who attacked children with dogs and fire hoses and
made Birmingham the Johannesburg of America are gone. But the
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where four children died in a bomb
blast one Sunday morning in fall 1963, still stands, a monument to
resistance, valor and abiding hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a distance, but we still have a distance to go,''
said U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), civil rights pioneer and one of
the nearly 400 delegates expected at this conference. ``All across
the South, small towns and rural communities are in the process of
laying down the burden of race.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP chairman said the conference proves how far the South
has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very title of the conference _ `Unfinished Business' _
reflects an acknowledgement that change has occurred, that progress
has been made,'' said Julian Bond, a veteran of Southern voter
registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   But his view, generally backed by the Census Bureau, is that the
story of race relations in the South is ``the standard half-full,
half-empty glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Unequal legacy lives on
</P>
<P>
   Politically, no better example can illustrate black gains than
Mississippi, a grisly killing field in the South's resistance to
racial equality in the 1960s. The Magnolia State now has more black
elected officials _ 803 _ than any other state in the nation. On
the other hand, it has elected only two black people to Congress
since the Civil War Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has steadily declined. In 1969, 20.3 percent of all
Southerners lived in poverty. Today, the poverty rate is 14.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, in both instances, the Southern rates exceed the
national averages. And when the focus is on black people and other
minorities, the extremes of poverty are even more obvious: Half of
all the poor children in the South are nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   Similar disparities are found in health, education, employment,
housing and justice, all testaments to the ``separate-but-unequal''
legacy that has shackled the South for a century:
</P>
<P>
   _ Poor Southerners are about eight times more likely to be
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 14 flagship state universities of the South and the
half-dozen most renowned private institutions enroll, collectively,
almost as many foreign students (7 percent) as African-Americans (8
percent) and other minorities (another 7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The South has added 14 million jobs since 1970, but most are
concentrated in the lower-paying clerical, sales and service
fields. And it has been losing jobs in agriculture, coal, oil, gas,
skilled crafts, equipment operating and low-tech manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-two percent of white people are homeowners, while 46
percent of minorities own their homes. Seventy percent of the
homeless are minorities, while 30 percent are white.
</P>
<P>
   _ The South's male prison population is 56 percent black, 29
percent white and 14 percent other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the South today _ indeed, in the entire nation _ skin color,
hair characteristics and nose shapes too often determine how people
vote, where they live, where their children go to school and what
dreams they dream.

<P>
   RICKY WILLIAMS ADVISORY
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas running back Ricky Williams needs 204 yards
to break the NCAA rushing record. His next chance to set a new mark
will come Saturday against Texas Tech in Lubbock (7 p.m. EST
kickoff). If he breaks the record in that game, the Austin
American-Statesman will move the following stories for use in
papers of Sunday, Nov. 15. If he does not break the record, the
stories will be held and rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   RICKYBEST _ A story that puts into perspective just what Ricky
Williams has achieved in passing the previous NCAA rushing record
of 6,082 yards previously held by former Pittsburgh running back
Tony Dorsett of Pitt, who played professionally for the Dallas
Cowboys. How many other great running backs didn't reach that
number and how durable he had to be. Story will include comments
from Mack Brown, Darrell Royal and others. (Wangrin, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   HEISMAN _ Setting the NCAA rushing record almost assures
Williams of winning the Heisman Trophy. How could voters not give
it to the all-time rusher? Well, it
</P>
<P>
   used to happen. Lists of winners. Some of the notable rushing
leaders who do not win the Heisman. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS and LIST
</P>
<P>
   SENIOR _ Why did Williams decide to come back for his senior
year? He could have gone in the NFL draft last year and would have
been a first-round pick. He gambled that he wouldn't get hurt and
blow it all (except the Lloyd's of London policy) or have a
disappointing year and drop in the draft (which might have left him
playing for the Philadelphia Phillies). But Ricky guessed right and
this has worked out for him. He came back because he wanted the
Dorsett record and the Heisman. And he has checks coming in from
the Phillies now. Was it all about yardage? Or did he want to get
closer to a degree? (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT _ Cleveland TV stations are doing interviews with Ricky.
The Cleveland Browns are running the character checks. Looks like
they want to use their No. 1 pick in the draft on Ricky. How much
money would that mean? Do the Browns need his kind of running back?
When Tony Dorsett set the rushing record, the Cowboys didn't have
the No. 1 pick. But they traded to get him. Are there other teams
out there wanting Ricky badly enough to do some last-minute
war-room trading? We'll ask the experts. (Cantu, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH GRAPHIC (of all his records set, pending,
tied and yet to come).
</P>
<P>
   BOHLS-COLUMN _ LUBBOCK, Texas _ The schedule very clearly states
that Texas is playing Texas Tech today, but given the relative
success of Texas' last opponent, some might expect to see a team
that looks a lot like Oklahoma State when they get to Jones
Stadium. The Longhorns insist that is not the case. (Bohls, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING-PHENOM _ NITRO, W. VA. _ J.R. House is the most
prolific passer in high school history, breaking records once held
by Tim Couch. But yards and completions are not the only
mind-boggling numbers posted by the senior quarterback. He also may
have the record for transfers between two schools. House plays
football each fall in West Virginia, where his father owns an auto
dealership. He plays baseball each spring in Florida, where his
father owns a bar/restaurant. The yearly moves have caused
controversy in both states, but not lessened House's
accomplishments. He will likely sign to play college football at
West Virginia or Georgia, and is expected to be an early-round
baseball draft pick. House and his father has been close to Georgia
coach Jim Donnan since his days at Marshall. (Curtright, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 60. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED THURSDAY.

   FBN-FALCONS-ADVANCE _ They have been the measuring stick for
years in the NFC West and NFL. So when San Francisco faces Atlanta
today for the West lead, it will be interesting to see if this
challenge from the Falcons is real or memorex. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 13.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NFL-MINDSET _ It can be one of the most unsettling mindsets
in sports: How do you get over the hump when an another team has
your number? This is the story of the Falcons-49ers game today. The
49ers have dominated Atlanta forever, and the Falcons know it.
Atlanta's players have their thoughts about what it will take to
get over the hump. So do local sports psychologists. (Winkeljohn,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

 &HT;    Medicine's new PET
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barbara O'Rourke learned last year she had an advanced
case of breast cancer that could take her life within 18 months.
But the 42-year-old mother is trying to stay alive as long as
possible to see her teen-age daughter grow.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why when she discovered a lump under her arm, O'Rourke
wanted to know if it too was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor ordered a PET scan, one of the most cutting-edge
diagnostic tools in medicine. The scan found that the lump was not
cancerous. But it did discover that the cancer had spread to her
hips _ something that had not been detected by MRI and CT scans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news was not good, the diagnosis bought O'Rourke
time. Without the scan, it might have taken months for doctors to
discover the cancer had spread. But as soon as the cancer was
confirmed, she started taking aredia, an experimental medicine
designed to help bones retain calcium and block the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know these things,'' said O'Rourke, a Peachtree
City mother of a 13-year-old. ``Time becomes so precious. And this
scan gave me a head start in trying to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   PET, a pricey technology that has traditionally been confined to
academic centers, could soon make its way into community hospitals.
And that means more patients like O'Rourke, who was scanned at the
Emory Center for PET, could get a clearer picture of how sick they
are.
</P>

   More than two dozen Atlanta doctors attended a symposium
sponsored by Northside Hospital this week to learn about PET, short
for positron emission tomography. And depending on their level of
enthusiasm, hospitals might show more interest in buying the
machines, which can cost as much as $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Northside Hospital, for example, is conducting a cost analysis
of PET. ``I would like to try and get a PET scanner by the year
2000,'' said Dr. James B. Weinstein, director of nuclear medicine
and co-director of diagnostic ultrasound at Northside Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There's little argument that PET is a valuable clinical tool.
From heart disease to cancer to mental illness, studies have shown
that the scanner has an impressive track record of finding disease
that other scanners have missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is PET is a clinical tool that community
hospitals should be using,'' said Ernest V. Garcia, physicist and
director of the Emory Center for PET, the only center in Georgia
that conducts PET scans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike X-rays and other imaging technologies that essentially
take pictures of organs, bones and blood, PET scans provide images
of how the body is actually working or being affected by disease.
For example, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT-scan would
show ``beautiful'' anatomical pictures of a dead patient's brain,
Garcia said. But it would take a PET scan to show that the brain is
actually dead.
</P>
<P>
   PET relies on chemical tracers injected into patients to track
body processes. A glucose tracer, for instance, is used to detect
cancer cells with PET. Cancer cells are particularly voracious in
their consumption of the base sugar. So as the glucose travels
throughout the body, a radioactive marker remains where it is most
used _ allowing physicians to pinpoint regions of cancer undetected
by other scan.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke said the procedure was ``stress-free.'' It wasn't like
an MRI, where she was confined with ear plugs in a cylinder with
oxygen pumped in. The PET required O'Rourke to lie very still on a
table after she was injected with the glucose tracer. And then the
machine scanned her from head to toe, taking images from above.
</P>
<P>
   PET has much better cancer detection rates than other forms of
scanners, according to the Institute for Clinical PET and the UCLA
School of Medicine. For example, abstracts and studies published
since the early 1990s have found:
</P>
<P>
   PET has an 81 percent detection rate for lung cancer, compared
with a 52 percent rate with a CT scanner; a 95 percent rate for
colon cancer, compared with 68 percent with CT; and an 85 percent
rate for breast cancer, compared with 67 percent with mammography.
The scanner also can detect whether a cancer has spread beyond
doctors' abilities to treat it. That prevents patients from going
through surgery, or rigorous radiation and chemotherapy treatments,
that will not save them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, it can also show how well treatment is
working, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   PET is useful in heart attack cases because the scanner is able
to detect how much heart tissue is damaged. That is critical
because it can help a surgeon determine whether the patient should
have bypass surgery, or perhaps be listed as an organ transplant
candidate. And it has been extremely effective in diagnosing
seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, and mental illnesses such as
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But PET suffers from its own image problems. Because private
insurance and Medicare, the government health care plan for the
elderly, have traditionally refused to reimburse for PET use,
community hospitals have had little motivation to invest in the
scanners. It is also about twice as expensive as other scanners -
costing $2,000 a scan, compared to $1,000 for a standard MRI.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, PET does not give a clean image of the body like
more traditional machines, but merely pinpoints hot spots of cancer
growth or other disease. ``Surgeons like to deal with things that
look like what they see in surgery,'' Weinstein said. ``PET gives
you a fuzzy picture that doesn't directly correspond to the anatomy
and a lot of surgeons don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, MRI, CT and ultrasound technologies are starting to
use some of the same principals of PET. A new enhanced MRI
technology _ that can distinguish between benign and malignant
tumors _ is being tested in clinical trials in Chicago. And there
are discussions on how to combine PET with more traditional
scanners, said Jennifer Keppler, director for the Institute for
Clinical PET.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, PET has become more attractive to community hospitals
because Medicare, the government health plan for the elderly,
agreed this year to pay for the scans on a limited basis. And more
managed care companies have approved its cost _ mostly because of
data that reflects its accuracy in detection and its ability to
help doctors pick the most appropriate course of treatment, which
in advanced cases of disease, may be no treatment at all.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hoffman, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia vice
president, said the insurer covers PET in such cases as epileptic
patients who are candidates for surgery and certain lung cancer
patients. However, many others are still considered
investigational, he said, and may not be covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our medical policies are always under review,'' said Hoffman.
``And our staff is constantly reviewing medical literature to learn
about new technologies, which includes PET scanning.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that nod of approval, community hospitals are
re-evaluating such a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very impressive,'' said Dr. Ron Steis, an oncologist with
Atlanta Cancer Care, who attended the symposium. ``But here's the
bottom line: It might be the best thing since sliced bread, but if
patients can't pay the price, and insurance companies won't, it
ends up being a nice tool that's not very useful.''

 &HT;    Medicine's new PET
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barbara O'Rourke learned last year she had an advanced
case of breast cancer that could take her life within 18 months.
But the 42-year-old mother is trying to stay alive as long as
possible to see her teen-age daughter grow.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why when she discovered a lump under her arm, O'Rourke
wanted to know if it too was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor ordered a PET scan, one of the most cutting-edge
diagnostic tools in medicine. The scan found that the lump was not
cancerous. But it did discover that the cancer had spread to her
hips _ something that had not been detected by MRI and CT scans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news was not good, the diagnosis bought O'Rourke
time. Without the scan, it might have taken months for doctors to
discover the cancer had spread. But as soon as the cancer was
confirmed, she started taking aredia, an experimental medicine
designed to help bones retain calcium and block the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know these things,'' said O'Rourke, a Peachtree
City mother of a 13-year-old. ``Time becomes so precious. And this
scan gave me a head start in trying to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   PET, a pricey technology that has traditionally been confined to
academic centers, could soon make its way into community hospitals.
And that means more patients like O'Rourke, who was scanned at the
Emory Center for PET, could get a clearer picture of how sick they
are.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Atlanta doctors attended a symposium
sponsored by Northside Hospital this week to learn about PET, short
for positron emission tomography. And depending on their level of

SCHOOL OFFICIALS URGED TO SEARCH LOCKERS AT RANDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ The state attorney general, Peter Verniero,
urged school officials Saturday to start authorizing random
searches of student lockers for drugs and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a convention of the New Jersey School Boards
Association at a hotel here, Verniero said drug abuse was a ``major
problem'' in the state's schools, adding that one in five high
school students had admitted using alcohol or drugs before class.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero's office distributed a guidelines manual of more than
300 pages earlier this year advising school officials that current
state laws make it legal for them to authorize such searches. But
the attorney general said Saturday that many districts had not
acted to authorize the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some educators, to their credit, will err on the side of not
conducting a search out of fear of violating someone's rights,'' he
said. ``But on the other hand if you've got reasonable suspicion
for conducting a search, by all means you should conduct a search
because the bottom line is we want to prevent a tragedy from
happening in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The School Search Policy Manual, which has more than 300 pages,
says that students' bags and lockers may be searched if officials
have reasonable grounds for suspecting wrongdoing, and that lockers
may be inspected randomly if the policy is announced at the start
of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero, who is chairman of a national task force on violence
among the young, said many state attorneys general were seeking to
copy the New Jersey manual.
</P>
<P>
   Several school officials said Saturday they had never heard of
the guidelines. Diane Cooper, president of the East Orange Board of
Education, said she did not know that schools could adopt random
search policies, but that she would ask her board to consider doing
so to help counter a drug and gang problem in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she said, a high school student was suspended for a
year after teachers found a knife in his knapsack. ``We have been
cautious in letting principals know that you do not infringe upon
students' rights,'' she said. ``Students have to feel that they are
protected from unauthorized or unprovoked harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Thomas, a member of the Piscataway Board of Education, said
her district did not have a random search policy and probably would
not adopt one because drugs and weapons were not serious problems
in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Sooy, a board member for Mainland Regional High School in
Atlantic County, said his district did not conduct random searches
and probably would not, but that a search of high school girls'
lockers two years ago turned up a large quantity of heroin. ``We
are very cautious of doing it,'' he said. ``We have to have some
very hard evidence. I think it's going a little too far if you do
it without just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I am wondering if we are getting too tight a society
_ if there are too many regulations.''

 &HT;    EDs: ANATOMY OF A CRASH _ a seven-part series
 &HT;    Award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Gary M.
Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine to
Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529, a small propeller-driven plane that crashed in a
hayfield in West Georgia killing 10 of the 29 people aboard. In a
seven-part series beginning Sunday, Pomerantz vividly describes the
9 minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard the doomed aircraft and
how the tragedy has reshaped lives. Photos and illustrations for
the series and layouts from Parts One, Two and Three will be posted
in a folder slugged ASA-CRASH in the National folder on the Cox
server.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    9 minutes, 20 seconds: The crash of ASA Flight 529
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
 &HT;    By Gary M. Pomerantz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ASA Flight 529 was more than three miles high when a
propeller blade broke off its left wing. The Atlantic Southeast
Airlines twin-engine turboprop carrying 29 people shuddered and
fell.
</P>
<P>
   In window seat 2A, a young woman who had served in the Army
thought she'd heard a small cannon explode. She looked out and saw
the propeller declare war on the left wing. She slammed shut her
window shade, frightened by the sight and what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant Robin Fech grabbed the metal kitchen galley to
steady herself. Soda cans trembled. Under her breath, Fech cursed.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh row, a shipyard worker from Maine thought the
plane had hit an air pocket.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer with a New York accent thought they'd struck a bird.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Baltimore schoolteacher in front of him, though she
wondered, What type of bird flies this high? A peregrine falcon,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   A young deputy sheriff had lost track of time and altitude. He
thought the plane had hit a tree or skimmed a mountainside. So
severe was the shudder that his partner next to him, a law
enforcement lifer, grabbed the young deputy's left knee to keep
from falling on him.
</P>
<P>
   Almost reflexively, the flight attendant told passengers, ``This
plane is designed to fly on one engine.'' But in a moment, seeing
the damage, even she didn't believe that.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, the co-pilot thought the propeller separation
sounded like someone had hit a trash can with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane dropped _ dramatically at first, then more
gradually _ the veteran pilot beside him said, ``What the hell's
going on with this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In nine minutes and 20 seconds, the plane would crash. Just
before 1 p.m. on Aug. 21, 1995, ASA Flight 529 would slam through a
grove of pine trees and into a hayfield in Carroll County.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would bounce twice, breaking apart as it went. The
cabin would depressurize and fill with sunlight and humid air. A
fuel-fed fire would break out at 1,800 degrees. Then, unspeakable
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 people aboard, 19 lived to tell about it. In the
telling, survivors almost without exception have asked themselves
the same question about those nine minutes and 20 seconds: Was it
really that long?
</P>
<P>
   At home, that's long enough to walk around the block or load the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   But how long is it when your plane is falling?
</P>
<P>
   Long enough to fill the passenger cabin with the quiet of
judgment day.
</P>
<P>
   They sat three across in narrow seats with thin backs, each row
containing a single seat to the left of the aisle and two to the
right. They rode in a tube, claustrophobic to some, 10 rows in all.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit door to row 10 in back was 31 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That tight space contained 27 lives, full and varied: Catholic,
Baptist, Methodist, Jewish, atheist, white, black, Asian, never
married, once divorced, twice divorced. The passengers of Flight
529 had 18 spouses, 41 children and more than two dozen
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was bound from Atlanta to Gulfport, Miss. Passengers'
destinations included a grocery store in Mobile, Ala., a hospital
in Jackson, Miss., a chemical plant in Muscle Shoals, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   There were two deputy sheriffs from Virginia en route to
retrieve a fugitive. A federal prosecutor investigating riverboat
gambling in Gulfport. A New Orleans woman returning home after
interviewing for a job as an ASA flight attendant. An 18-year-old
airman heading for his first assignment in Biloxi. A young
Mississippi minister coming back after giving a trial sermon that
had wowed a Midwest congregation.
</P>
<P>
   With them was a crew of three: a divorced 37-year-old flight
attendant working long hours for $20,000 a year; a young,
self-confident first officer from California who was five months
into his childhood dream of being a commercial pilot; and the
captain, a seven-year veteran at ASA who loved flying the
high-performance Brazilian-made plane, once telling his wife, ``I
think I can get one down in a field somewhere if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   A few passengers had expected to be on a jet, not a turboprop.
Some had even thought they were flying Delta, only to be told ASA
was ``the Delta Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping aboard en route to a family get-together in
Mississippi, Baltimore teacher Dawn Dumm and her 64-year-old mother
took two front-row seats. Neither liked the feel of the tiny
Brasilia. Dumm thought the carpet and seat coverings looked worn,
like those on a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm had become more careful after a series of personal
tragedies, including her father's cancer death and heart surgery
for an infant child. The common theme, she decided, was that she
had had no control over these things. A devout Catholic, she now
collected decorative angels.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm once heard a travel expert say that synthetic material
burns into your skin in a fire whereas cotton burns away from it.
On this trip, she wore clothes made of cotton, as did her mother,
Mary Jean Adair. In an emergency, they would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   To her family, Adair had a sixth sense, an uncanny ability to
know when things weren't right. To Adair, this plane did not feel
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this at all,'' she told her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think of it as an adventure'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, still at the airport, an overhead light panel
came loose in the fifth row. A mechanic came aboard to reattach the
unit. Asked if he had fixed it, the mechanic told flight attendant
Fech, ``I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Adair asked her daughter: ``Don't you think we
should get off?''
</P>
<P>
   9:20 to impact. When the blade broke in the clouds 20 minutes
after takeoff, ASA Flight 529 was climbing past 18,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Brasilia yawed and fell sharply to the left. A cup of apple
juice spilled at the feet of Angela Brumfield, the aspiring flight
attendant in the second row. Passengers napping in the second,
fourth and sixth rows shot up in their seats. In the third and
seventh rows, one man reading a golf magazine and another a novel
about Vietnam instinctively turned left toward the noise.
</P>
<P>
   The plane fell nearly 4,000 feet in the next minute.
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the left engine _ a noise reassuring in its
steadiness _ suddenly quieted. The right engine whined louder.
</P>
<P>
   For 33 seconds, the aircraft shook, at times violently.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers focused on what had happened to the left engine. Once
sleek, it now seemed a junk pile. The metal covering of the engine
had ripped apart and peeled back, exposing the machinery's guts.
Wires flapped in the winds. Hydraulic fluid, oil and jet fuel
poured into the airstream.
</P>
<P>
   The propeller unit was not where it was supposed to be. Three of
the four propeller blades had been blown out of position by several
feet and now were lodged against the front edge of the wing. The
fourth blade was missing.
</P>
<P>
   To David Schneider, a young construction engineer in the eighth
row, it looked like a bomb had exploded in the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gray, a 100,000-mile-a-year frequent flier from Connecticut
in the twilight of his business career, thought, After all these
years of flying, now it happens!
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Pfisterer, a purchasing manager for a paper company, was a
nervous flier even before the propeller separated. Usually
conversation with other passengers got him past his nerves. That
and a Jack Daniel's on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbstruck, Pfisterer watched the fluids spray. This can't be!
he told himself. Pfisterer feared an engine fire. He couldn't take
his eyes off the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Fech slid open the window shade in the second row to look for
herself. The sight of the mangled machinery was enough to make her
shut the shade at once.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers, turning from the engine, looked to the flight
attendant for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the frightened eyes fixed on her, Fech felt as
if she had 26 children on board.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor by nature, Fech was an emotive woman from Athens,
Ga., quick with self-deprecating humor. She hadn't made a career as
a ballet instructor or in marriage (``Best party I ever went to; I
just went home with the wrong person''). At 37, her passions were
her job, which she performed with command, and ASA's frequent
fliers, whom she embraced and greeted with a small-town
familiarity: ``Hi, Hon-eey!''
</P>
<P>
   She had yet to have her toughness tested in crisis, though she
understood long before this flight that passenger safety was her
primary responsibility. That was spelled out on a nightshirt she
had at home: ``I'm Here to Save Your Ass, Not Kiss It!''
</P>
<P>
   Fech had little room to work in: The aisle was just 20 inches
wide and, at 5-foot-6, she bumped her head unless she walked
precisely down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   8:19 to impact. At 14,200 feet and falling, Fech improvised.
</P>
<P>
   She lied.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers' questions came: ``What happened? Are we going to
be OK?'' Fech placed her hands reassuringly on their shoulders and
said, ``These planes are designed to fly on one engine.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, Fech knew, when the inoperable engine was a
shutdown, but not, as in this case, when it was deformed.
</P>
<P>
   She told passengers, ``It's one of the first things flight crews
practice _ going in with one engine.'' Again, she knew, this
applied to shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Fech snapped shut the window shades on the left side
of the plane. ``We don't need to be looking at that,'' she said.
The plane stopped shaking. The smoothness helped Fech's credibility
with passengers. So did the clouds, which kept them from
recognizing the rate of their descent.
</P>
<P>
   But violent tremors soon undid her work. ``That's just what
turbulence feels like with one engine,'' Fech lied.
</P>
<P>
   When Fech reached the sixth row, the nervous flier there
blurted: ``Do you think we are going to make it?'' Pfisterer's
voice was tense and loud enough to be heard across the aisle. Fech
assured him, ``Of course, we're going to make it.'' But the nervous
flier kept talking, an edge to his voice. ``How can that fly like
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing his alarm could infect the other passengers, Fech
stepped to the next row.
</P>
<P>
   She heard the bells' ding-dong and saw a small red light
flashing on the wall panel in back. The cockpit was calling.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God that Ed Gannaway is flying this plane, she thought.
They'd flown together often, and once had handled smoothly a
medical emergency on a flight originating in Augusta, Ga. Gan-
</P>
<P>
   naway was like a big brother to her, even advising her on her
401(k) plan. His voice soothed.
</P>
<P>
   And soothing was just what Fech, the emissary from cockpit to
cabin, needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cockpit door, all hell had broken loose.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the propeller broke, a chaotic clamor filled the
cockpit. Chimes signaled a master warning: Ding, ding, ding. Then
came a synthesized woman's voice meant to alarm, a voice known
cynically to pilots as ``The Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bitch called out: ``Autopilot, engine control, oil.''
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 seconds, Gannaway and the co-pilot, Matt Warmerdam,
were on the ragged edge of losing control of their plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a left engine out,'' Gannaway said as the shuddering
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic clamor: Ding, ding, ding ... ``Autopilot, engine
control, oil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some help here,'' Gannaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane pulled hard left, trying to turn itself, flip and
spiral into the ground. The damaged propeller was creating
excessive drag and a loss of wing lift. Had it simply fallen off,
controlling the plane would have been easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell's going on with this thing?'' Gannaway asked.
</P>
<P>
   The two men took on the machine, white-knuckling their steering
columns and staring wide-eyed into instrument panels for heading,
altitude, air speed and the power setting on the good engine.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they fought to regain control. They put on their
headsets, and then Warmerdam's call went out. ``Atlanta Center. AC
529, declaring an emergency. We've had an engine failure. We're out
at fourteen two at this time,'' he said, referring to the altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Center responded, ``AC 529, roger, left turn direct
Atlanta.'' They would turn back to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Early that morning, Gannaway had left home in Dublin, Ga., for
his base in Macon. A compulsive exerciser, he'd run his usual three
miles first.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jackie, had seen fear in him only once, after he'd
made a scheduled run to Gulfport through thunderstorms that
diverted his plane to three airports. With his fuel low, he later
told his wife, he had prayed for a safe landing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, manipulating the flight variables over the next 45 seconds,
Gannaway said, ``It's getting more controllable here ... the engine
... Let's watch our speed.''
</P>
<P>
   7:01 to impact. To Gannaway, Warmerdam said, ``I'll tell Robin
what's goin' on.'' He hit the call button.
</P>
<P>
   If Fech had hoped for a soothing call, she didn't get it. Hoping
to hear Gannaway, she got Warmerdam instead.
</P>
<P>
   This troubled her because she knew Gannaway liked to be in
contact with the cabin and to be in total control of his plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we had an engine failure, Robin,'' Warmerdam said. ``We've
declared an emergency. We're diverting back into Atlanta. Go ahead
and, uh, brief the passengers. This will be an emergency landing
back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained to ask questions in such moments _ How much time do we
have? Will there be a warning or bells? What is my signal for
evacuation? _ Fech didn't think to ask one. She said, ``All right.
Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10,000 feet, still in the clouds, Gannaway realized Atlanta
was too far away. He told Warmerdam, ``We need an airport quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam at once radioed Atlanta Center: ``We need an airport
quick, and, uh, roll the trucks and everything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The center replied that West Georgia Regional Airport near
Carrollton was 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Gannaway told his first officer, ``Engine failure checklist,
please.''
</P>
<P>
   6:45 to impact. Fech took a deep breath, gathered herself,
pushed the P.A. button, then turned to face 26 passengers.
Repeating what she had been told, she announced the plane was
headed back to Atlanta. She sounded firm even though she was as
frightened as she had ever been in flight.
</P>
<P>
   She announced, ``The cockpit crew has confirmed we have an
emergency. We have an engine failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The nervous flier in row six thought to himself, Yeah, you've
got an engine problem, all right!
</P>
<P>
   Fech reiterated that the plane could fly on one engine.
</P>
<P>
   She told passengers they needed to prepare, just in case: Make
certain your seat belt is low and tight, place your feet flat on
the floor, review your emergency card.
</P>
<P>
   Then she explained the brace position _ crossed wrists against
the seat back in front of you, foreheads pressed against the wrists
_ and told passengers she wanted individual demonstrations.
``You'll have to prove this to me,'' she said. She asked if there
were any questions.
</P>
<P>
   No one had any. Fech hurriedly cleared off the galley.
</P>
<P>
   On the left side of the plane, passengers inched up their window
shades.
</P>
<P>
   4:46 to impact. The Brasilia continued to fall, though at a
slower rate, about 1,500 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   At 7,000 feet, this gave some a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   A few understood the principles of flight. But for most, flying
was an act of faith in the people who build, inspect and fly
planes. ``You put your trust in them,'' Dumm, the teacher, would
say.
</P>
<P>
   Living in an age of flight, these passengers boarded planes
without a second thought, never questioning how 24,000 pounds
remained aloft. They accepted the seeming exactitude of flight, the
overall safety and speed of it. What Lewis and Clark once took more
than a year to cover could be covered now in less than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a safe touchdown, Gray, the Connecticut
businessman, imagined a foam landing strip and a bouncy ride in.
</P>
<P>
   The young deputy in row nine thought back to childhood fears and
the way things always turned out OK. This will be over, too, Tod
Thompson reminded himself. Besides, he didn't want to be one of
those people screaming up and down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Two rows forward, David McCorkell, a computer trainer from
Minnesota, believed things would turn out fine. He'd landed in a
blizzard as fire trucks lined the runway. When that plane landed
safely, every passenger clapped. Now, McCorkell was more worried
about the loss of a half-day's billing. A couple of hundred
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty, that's how Fech felt as she walked the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty that she had anything to do with this mess.
</P>
<P>
   And scared.
</P>
<P>
   For Fech, the hardest part was seeing passengers' shock and
disbelief while trying to conceal her own.
</P>
<P>
   At each seat, she corrected brace positions, gently pushing down
heads and lifting elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Fech asked the three passengers sitting by emergency exits if
they would accept responsibility for opening the doors once the
plane came to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   A quivering right hand went up in row five, where the retired
woman from Asheville, N.C., said softly, ``No, no.'' Lucille Burton
wanted to sit with her husband, Lonnie, who earlier had moved to
the back for more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Fech called out for a volunteer to take Mrs. Burton's seat to
keep the weight and balance in the plane roughly as it was.
</P>
<P>
   From the back, a tall, well-groomed federal prosecutor _ who
loved nothing more than standing before juries _ suddenly stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it,'' Bond Rhue said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and held up his emergency card. ``Don't worry,'' he
said. ``I've read this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhue, investigating riverboat gambling in Mississippi, wore a
tie featuring little pigs. He thought it apt for a trip to the
South, reasoning, ``I am going to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhue took 5C. The Burtons resettled in the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Fech, hardly anyone spoke. Most passengers were
sitting next to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't even make eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   They stared at the left wing, then at Fech, then stared at the
left wing some more.
</P>
<P>
   In row six, Alan Barrington, a human resources manager from
Roswell, looked at his emergency card, read about flotation devices
and exit rows, and thought, If we crash, this card won't do me any
good.
</P>
<P>
   The right engine whined on. In the ninth row, Charles Barton
asked his partner to open his window shade. Barton wanted to see
the good engine. ``No way,'' Thompson said. ``If that propeller
isn't turning, I don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastily, Fech instructed passengers to remove pens and other
sharp objects from their pockets. Take off your eyeglasses, too,
she said, and put your drinks into the seat-back pockets.
</P>
<P>
   In row six, Barrington listened closely. Did she say pour the
drinks out? he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Barrington prayed: ``Heavenly Father, when this
plane crashes and I die, I'm ready to go home. But please, Lord,
let me ask for just a few favors.'' He first asked to die quickly.
Then he asked that his wife have the strength to raise their four
young children and that they always remember their father's love.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barrington's thoughts turned more primitive: What does it
feel like to have your head and limbs ripped off? The thought
tingled his spine. Will I even feel it? Will I go to heaven
immediately?
</P>
<P>
   Two rows ahead, Gray wasn't thinking of God. For one thing, he
didn't believe in God. He believed that life had its own set of
natural circumstances and rhythms. An engineer by training, he had
diagnosed the problem on the left wing in his own way: This was an
abnormal part of life's natural circumstances and rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   In row two, the young woman from New Orleans who was preparing
to become an ASA flight attendant thought of death. Brumfield
didn't want to panic, least of all in a plane. Tears came, so she
stared at the ceiling, hoping to keep them from running down her
face.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the young deputy, looked at the right-side window in
row nine. He wondered: If this glass breaks, am I going to be
sucked outside?
</P>
<P>
   2:44 to impact. With the plane at 4,000 feet, air traffic
controllers in Atlanta told the pilot that West Georgia Regional
Airport was eight miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get in on a visual,'' Gannaway replied from the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown voice from another aircraft visited the drama: ``Good
luck, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``'Preciate it,'' Warmerdam replied.
</P>
<P>
   2:09 to impact. For the first time, Gannaway peered over his
left shoulder and saw the damage to the left engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hanging out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In row two, John Tweedy, the engineer with a New York accent,
thought of his wife and 3-year-old son. He decided life was good
and that he wasn't ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In row three, Barney Gaskill, a 57-year-old Ohioan, thought of
his family, too. He imagined his wife, daughter and son, his
grandkids and his mother. They lived in different states, and in a
dire moment such as this, that bothered him. He felt the need to
address them collectively.
</P>
<P>
   In row seven, McCorkell no longer bemoaned the loss of a
half-day's billing. Now he was angry with God.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't believe he should die alone. At 37 and twice divorced
_ the last time just 13 months ago from a woman he still loved _
he'd never had this thought before. He traveled so regularly that
his two teen-age sons didn't even know where he was at this moment.
Now all he wanted was a hand to hold, or at least to see someone
familiar in his last living moment.
</P>
<P>
   Denied this, bitterness filled him.
</P>
<P>
   Fech moved purposefully through the middle rows, correcting
brace positions. In row eight, Schneider concentrated on his
emergency-door responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm supposed to pull this handle right here,'' he told
Fech.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's confidence gave Fech someone to count on. But then
her own insecurity came into play: He knows I'm scared and he
thinks I need to be reassured.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, Schneider felt a young man's invincibility. He told
himself, People know when they are going to die, and I am not going
to die. A Catholic, he tended to necessities and prayed a form of
the rosary: an Our Father, a Hail Mary and a Glory Be, ending with:
``... as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world
without end. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Up front, Dumm, the Baltimore teacher, asked her mother to take
her seat belt on and off, on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the door in front of us is blocked,'' she told her mother,
``you'll have to get down on your hands and knees and crawl. Count
the rows, because the fifth row is where we have to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumm thought of her husband and their two sons. With her
mother's attention diverted for a moment, Dumm quietly tore the
cover from her paperback novel and, in a nervous scrawl, wrote a
goodbye note:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the Lights of My Life. Always, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she wrote to her boys: ``Lucas and Zeke: Be Good Always.
Prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumm folded the note and tucked it inside the fanny pack around
her waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should we do now?'' her mother asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should pray,'' Dumm replied.
</P>
<P>
   They joined hands and said the Lord's Prayer: ``... Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven ...''
</P>
<P>
   1:28 to impact. The cockpit chaos continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing-, single-, single-engine checklist, please,'' said
Gannaway, never a stutterer until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where ... is it?'' Warmerdam replied.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer had his own question: ``Where's the airport?''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Atlanta Approach Control gave him his answer:
still six miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Now passengers noted a rural mosaic: fields, trees and scattered
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Fech stood in the back at the U shape formed by rows 8, 9 and
10. She noticed Lucille Burton standing by her back-row seat, as if
confused. ``What are you doing?'' Fech asked. ``You've got to sit
down now.'' Burton's husband helped fasten her seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   A voice deep within told Fech to hurry back to her jump seat.
</P>
<P>
   So she headed up the aisle. Standing by the front row, she
realized they had broken through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   0:38 to impact. From the cockpit, speed and altitude dropping,
the pilots saw a 10-acre field to their left near Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   The plane trembled. In the cockpit, a synthesized male voice
warned that the plane's altitude was only 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The landing gear and flaps remained retracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too Low Gear,'' The Bitch warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fech saw the trees and quickly backed the last few steps toward
her jump seat. She shouted, ``Brace position! Brace position! Stay
down! Stay down!''
</P>
<P>
   In row six, the nervous flier, seeing the pines, shut his window
shade for the first time. He told himself, You're dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine shipyard worker in row seven flashed a painted-on
smile to the stranger next to him and said, ``Good luck.'' The
computer trainer from Minnesota stared back, fear in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's mother made the sign of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   A few raised their heads one last time to look. Seeing this,
Fech shouted, ``Heads down! Heads down!''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her, in the cockpit, she heard the recorded warnings
through the closed panel door.
</P>
<P>
   She'd never heard The Bitch before. The sound terrified her.
</P>
<P>
   0:08 to impact. Still four miles short of West Georgia Regional
Airport, Fech tightened the strap on her jump seat. Holding her
head upright and rigid, she placed both hands beneath her thighs in
her own brace position. She shouted to her passengers, ``Hold on,
y'all! This is going to be rough!'' She closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Several breaths from impact, Warmerdam didn't hear her. He'd
dreamed of flying since the age of 6. Now, nearly touching the
trees, feeling the plane's vibrations, hearing the warnings and The
Bitch, and then Gannaway's voice in his headset, ``Help me, help me
hold it, help me hold, help me hold it,'' Warmerdam squeezed the
steering column, continuing the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, he imagined his young wife. A pretty, final image.
Warmerdam left his goodbye to her on the cockpit voice recorder:
``Amy, I love you!''
</P>
<P>
   Impact. Its left wing tilted slightly downward, ASA Flight 529
hit the trees at nearly 140 miles per hour _ slamming through 360
feet of pines in about two seconds. First the plane sliced off
treetops, then went lower, chopping off trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet past the trees, the left wing struck the hayfield
first, and tore off.
</P>
<P>
   The left side of the plane's nose, near the rudder pedals by the
captain's left leg, dug into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the front of the passenger cabin, a woman screamed.
</P>
<P>
   In the second row, Brumfield, no longer wanting to be a flight
attendant, whispered, ``Oh God, oh God, oh God ...

<P>
   Dr. Robert Silber, a hematologist and educator, died on Nov. 3
at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Silber had been a clinical professor of medicine at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham for six years. He was the
director of New York University School of Medicine's hematology
division from 1968 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His scientific research focused chiefly on leukemia and on the
treatment of hematologic malignancies. In 1989 he was one of a
group of scientists who reported in the journal Science that a drug
derived from a Chinese tree had proved to be a potent agent against
colon cancer in experiments on animals.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna, Silber moved with his family to the Dominican
Republic in 1939 to escape Nazism. The family moved to the United
States in 1945. He graduated cum laude from New York University in
1950 and received his medical degree in 1954 from the State
University of New York's Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Silber joined the New York University medical school's faculty
in 1962 and became a full professor there as well as a division
head.
</P>
<P>
   Among the honors he received was a Guggenheim fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   His 1954 marriage to Barbara Carol Antell ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Barbara Kamhi Silber; two daughters,
Andrea Dickey of Guilford, Conn., and Laura Silber of Manhattan;
two sons, Jeffrey of Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael of Manhattan, and
four grandchildren.

SUSPECT IN FOUR RAPES IS IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man with a long criminal record, who had been
wanted in connection with four rapes at subway and bus stops in
Brooklyn, has been found on Long Island, the police said, where he
was arraigned Saturday on charges in two sex crimes there.
</P>
<P>
   The man, James Smith, 29, was arrested on Friday afternoon in
Freeport, Nassau County Police Department officials said, after a
15-year-old girl who said he had attempted to rape her a week
earlier spotted him on the street. After his arraignment Saturday
morning, he went to New York City for questioning in several
unsolved sexual assaults, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   According to detectives, the girl who alerted the police had
been walking on Pine Street in Freeport on Nov. 6, when a man
fitting Smith's description grabbed her and attempted to drag her
away, but she escaped and called the police. They added that Smith
was also accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl who was
grabbed while walking in that town.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was charged with attempted rape and sexual abuse in those
two cases, said Officer Patrick Byrne, a Nassau County police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who the police say uses several aliases and has a long
history of drug and robbery convictions, is also suspected in a
string of four attacks on women who were waiting for trains or
buses in Brooklyn. A single assailant was suspected in all of those
attacks because victims gave similar descriptions of the man and
fingerprints from several of the scenes matched.
</P>
<P>
   Smith became a suspect in those attacks after an anonymous
caller brought him to the attention of the Brooklyn Special Victims
Unit, and then three of the victims identified him through a
photograph as their attacker, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   According to police documents, a man believed to be Smith first
attacked at 10 a.m. on March 2, showing a handgun to a 19-year-old
woman waiting for a subway train in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and then
raping her at the end of the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, on Sept. 5, the police said, a man fitting
Smith's description robbed, raped and sodomized a 20-year-old woman
after following her onto a train at a subway station in Carroll
Gardens, Brooklyn, shortly after 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours later, a man believed to be the same
attacker pulled out a box cutter and then raped a 15-year-old girl
waiting at a bus stop in downtown Brooklyn. He fled after hailing a
cab for her, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The last assault in the series occurred at 9:30 a.m. on Sept.
10, when a man pretending to have a gun threatened to shoot a
23-year-old woman on a train unless she performed oral sex on him.
But as the train neared a station in Park Slope, she refused, the
police said. The man then fled into the station.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is also known as Bart Roman and Robert Gaines, is
known to loiter near pornography shops and has occasionally
solicited prostitutes, the police said, but he had never been
charged with rape.

A WALL STREET CHURCH TURNS NEIGHBORLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than 300 years, the parish of Trinity
Church, the landmark that sits at the head of Wall Street, has been
a force in the development of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first outpost of the Anglican faith in the Colonies, it once
owned all the land from Fulton to Christopher streets and from
Broadway to the Hudson River. Over the centuries it has given away
$3 billion, helping start more than 1,200 churches, schools,
universities and hospitals. Today, the parish still owns 5.5
million square feet of commercial real estate in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its riches and enduring influence, at the parish's
core is a small Episcopal church where people gather for communal
suppers, coffee hours and altar guild meetings, where the gyrations
of the nearby stock market seem remote. Now the church faces an
unfamiliar challenge, one more common to fledgling congregations:
how to be the spiritual heart of its surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, there was little need to cater to local residents
because, until the construction of Battery Park City and the
conversion of commercial buildings into apartment houses, there
were no local residents to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity was first a local church before it was a national or
international institution,'' said the Rev. Samuel Johnson Howard,
who has been vicar of the church for 11 months. ``Now, at last, we
see the possibility of having a positive impact on the spiritual
life of the immediate community again.''
</P>
<P>
   So church leaders are seeking ways to reach out to newcomers
without ignoring current parishioners, a remarkably diverse group
drawn from many different and sometimes distant locales.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the responsibility for recruiting new members falls to
Howard. ``A lot of my time,'' he said, ``has been occupied in
trying to figure out just who is in the neighborhood and decide on
ways we can reach them, serve them and meet their spiritual
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is trying a direct approach, especially with the
residents of Battery Park City, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   Though he concedes that his success has been limited, he says he
sees reason for hope. ``My wife and I have made it a real point to
entertain people around us,'' he said, ``to make friends, to try to
develop connections. Once you get behind their door, you develop a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy tipped the balance for Scott Morrison, 35, a
senior vice president at Schroders &AMP; Co., an investment bank, and
his wife, Laura, 32, a managing director of the New York Stock
Exchange. They live in Battery Park City and spent months visiting
churches before settling on Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week after we got there, Father Howard invited us and
three other young couples to his house for dinner,'' Morrison said.
``It was just a social get-together, and was an unexpectedly nice
way to meet new people. It's funny how a church can make a big
world into a small world.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Pam Guyot, the church's director of market planning,
are also trying a more scientific approach to attract new members.
They commissioned a demographic report of the neighborhood south of
Canal Street, including TriBeCa, Wall Street and Battery Park City,
which was completed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned some interesting thing about these folks,''
Howard said. ``On the whole they are fairly young, under 40, and
include an above-average number of singles. It is an affluent area
and a very educated one, and the number of people who identified
themselves as Episcopalians is almost 50 percent higher than it is
in the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is as we begin to identify the spiritual needs
of people in an area like this, we need to identify touchstone
issues,'' he continued. ``I expect the big ones will include
finding companionship and issues of aging parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials are adamant that the church's backbone, its
current roll of 750 members, not be ignored. ``The only thing that
is a bigger priority is taking care of the people who are already
here,'' Howard said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Trinity Church's distinctive characteristics is how far
people travel to reach it. The Rev. Daniel Paul Matthews, rector of
the parish, said parishioners travel an average of 35 minutes each
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably not two children in the congregation who go
to the same school,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's Sunday school, which includes children from 6 to 9,
has eight pupils, up from three last year. The youth ministry,
which educates children from 10 to 16, has 28 students.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic dispersion of their flock means that Howard and
his two colleagues, the Rev. Linda Moeller and the Rev. Nan Peete,
spend considerable time on subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastoral visits to the sick or those in crisis are perhaps the
most important part of any priest's work,'' Howard said. ``In
parishes I've served previously, I could visit a half a dozen
parishioners in an afternoon. Here, it often takes a whole
afternoon to visit just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Trinity's hallmarks is its racial diversity. At a
time when black, Korean, French, Albanian and many other national
groups have their own separate churches around the city, Trinity
Church draws an extraordinary blend of worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of its members are black, with half of those from
the Caribbean and Central America. The remaining 50 percent are a
melange of Asian and white, including Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   That diversity works in the church is simply accepted, and
parishioners see no need to analyze it. ``Everyone is just another
person here, and whatever you have to offer, they reach out and
grab it,'' said Evelyn Moss, a member of 27 years, who was the
first woman to serve as head usher.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine LaHuta, director of development for the New York
Academy of Medicine, who was chairwoman of the parish's 300th
anniversary celebration in 1996, drives in from Staten Island each
week for services. She feels that the population mix is a major
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a diversity of all God's people of all colors and
backgrounds, including some who are homeless and don't always smell
so wonderful,'' she said at a recent Sunday brunch. ``I pass a
dozen Episcopal churches on my way, but none can feed my spirit nor
fill my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her husband, Leff LaHuta, a retired teacher, said: ``It
was part of our marriage contract that, no matter where we live, we
have to drive to Trinity. And that was even before E-Z Pass.''

DEATH IN SURGERY REVEALS TROUBLED PRACTICE, LAX HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lisa Smart's presence on the operating table at Beth
Israel Medical Center on a Friday afternoon last November began in
an utterly unremarkable way.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smart, a 30-year-old financial analyst, had found the
doctor performing the procedure, Robert Klinger, the way many busy,
young and healthy people do _ by breezing through her HMO's book of
approved doctors and choosing one who was convenient and
recommended by her primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   Her only real medical problem was as common as it was benign:
She suffered from fibroid tumors in her uterus, and was at Beth
Israel to have them removed, a procedure that thousands of women
undergo every year, with 90 percent walking out of the hospital the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor and his assistant, Dr. Marc Sklar, were also a
routine presence, well known and well liked among their patients
and medical peers. They were two-thirds of a bustling obstetrics
and gynecology practice that delivered more babies at Beth Israel
than any other physician group.
</P>
<P>
   Even the presence of a medical equipment salesman from Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was not a novelty in the operating room, since
representatives of medical supply companies often observe surgical
procedures and give tips about equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, though, Mrs. Smart was dead. And this month, after a
yearlong investigation, state health officials reported that her
death was the result of two hours of botched surgery that violated
a host of medical standards; Beth Israel received the maximum fine,
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the incident was isolated, if horrific: one bad
outcome among thousands of good ones at a respected hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But more than two dozen interviews with doctors, hospital
administrators, patients of Klinger and Sklar and relatives of Mrs.
Smart, along with the state's report, show that behind the backdrop
of normality that November day was a deeply troubled medical
practice and a hospital that allowed some medical policies to be
flouted all too easily.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, on Park Avenue, was roiled by rising tension among
the doctors. The patient load was tremendous: The three doctors
delivered roughly twice as many babies a year as an average
practice of its size. And both Sklar and the third member of the
practice, Steven Swersky, were on probation for professional
misconduct, something Ms. Smart could not have known without
calling the state Health Department or checking its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel, by its administrators' own admission, fell down on
certain basic standards of care.
</P>
<P>
   The process of policing equipment and visitors had enough cracks
that, in violation of hospital policy, the medical-supply salesman
was able to roll an unauthorized piece of equipment into the
hospital, and then to operate a part of it during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smart was never told that the equipment being used was new
to the doctors; in fact, they were neither trained in its use nor
authorized to operate it. And the monitoring of fluids, so
important during an operation, was so lax that Mrs. Smart became
perilously bloated, even though nurses repeatedly warned the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been a blow to Beth Israel, a well-regarded
hospital that in recent years has been trying to raise its stature
among world-renowned New York medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a well-deserved reputation for providing outstanding
care, but obviously we did not give it in this incident,'' Morton
Hyman, Beth Israel's chairman, said in an interview last week. ``We
accept full responsibility and because of these violations, we have
significantly strengthened our oversight and policies of policing
procedures so that these violations cannot happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the death, Sklar and Swersky have lost their privileges at
Beth Israel, and Klinger must be supervised at all times. Mrs.
Smart's husband, Anderson Smart, a New York City police officer,
has sued almost every party involved in the case. And many of the
doctors' patients are expressing dismay about a case that
underscores how little patients frequently know about the doctors
who treat them.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is perhaps not surprising that Mrs. Smart, an
obsessive researcher of all things related to home decorating,
landscaping and accounting, did not spend weeks looking for a
doctor. She was, her husband recalled, in excellent shape and
extremely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But painful menstrual periods had sent her in search of medical
help, said her sister, Pamela Thomas, and although she was
frightened of surgery, she knew fibroids could interfere with
having children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very much into family and very much into having
children,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``I would say that summed her up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and Anderson Smart met as 15-year-olds working at a
Kentucky Fried Chicken in Queens. She would go to Long Island
University; he joined the police force. They were married on July
4, 1992, and by 1995 had built a home in Highland Mills, in Orange
County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, she had been a financial analyst at Chase Manhattan
Bank, often working late into the evening on deals. ``I was used to
it,'' Smart said. ``Lisa was a go-getter. She didn't like to waste
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was in the middle of tests to become a certified
public accountant, and dreamed of starting her own accounting firm.
But the fibroids were a painful obstacle, and so she went to
Klinger to see what could be done.
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Smart found was a midtown office that drew from
several walks of life: Hasidic women, women who liked its use of
midwives and a polyglot mix of people from the many managed care
plans it honored. The practice also had an office in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Peers at Beth Israel spoke highly of the three doctors. ``They
have an excellent reputation and had a great commitment to women in
labor,'' said one Beth Israel obstetrician, who, like other
doctors, agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sklar was particularly liked by patients for his warm manner and
quick mind. While waiting with patients in labor, he would watch
the game show ``Jeopardy'' and whiz through the questions with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   And the doctors were busy: They delivered 900 babies a year, far
above the national average of about 432 for a three-person
practice. Long waits for appointments were common.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the practice was overextended is unclear. But it was in
trouble with the state Department of Health. In June 1997, Sklar
was put on five years' probation. The charges included botched
labors and failing to perform Caesarean sections when they were
medically necessary, resulting in the deaths of two babies, the
state says. Roger Solymosy, Sklar's lawyer, said he would not
comment. The lawyer for Klinger, Paul Walker, did not return
repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Sklar was disciplined, Swersky, who founded the
practice a decade ago, was placed on four years' probation. The
charges were poor record-keeping and incomplete prenatal care,
including failing to do the standard diabetes test in pregnant
women. Swersky insists that he became a target because of his ties
to Sklar, and that most of the complaints can be chalked up to bad
record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They reviewed old charts,'' he said, referring to the Health
Department, which indeed cited cases going back several years.
``Since we got computerized, my records have been very good. I've
changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Having two of three doctors in a practice on probation was
vexing to Beth Israel; out of 2,000 doctors, fewer than five are on
probation, administrators say. But the hospital took no action. As
a result of the probation, Sklar had to be supervised by a Beth
Israel doctor during deliveries, but not for surgical procedures
like Ms. Smart's.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the benefit of hindsight,'' Hyman said, ``we would have
made a different decision about Sklar,'' intimating that the
hospital would have severed its relationship with the doctor
sooner. As for whether similarly disciplined doctors would be
allowed to practice at Beth Israel in the future, he added: ``The
bar has been significantly raised.''
</P>
<P>
   No one but those present in the operating room at Beth Israel's
Phillips Ambulatory Care Center last Nov. 20 will probably ever
know the full details of how routine surgery took such a terrible
turn. But the events that led to Mrs. Smart's death began a day
earlier, when David Myers, the medical supply salesman, convinced
Sklar and Klinger, the head surgeon on the case, that he had
obtained authorization from Beth Israel to bring in his Versapoint
Bipolar Hysteroscopy Electrosurgery System for use in the
hysteroscopic myomectomy, or removal of fibroid tumors.
</P>
<P>
   This much seems clear: Beth Israel had never approved the use of
the equipment, and Myers himself rolled it into the building and up
to bioengineering for technical clearance on the day of the
surgery, basically a sound check for equipment, said Gail Donovan,
Beth Israel's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors performed the procedure, using the machine to fill
Mrs. Smart with saline solution and then vaporizing the tumor. But
nurses soon noted with alarm that fluid was not draining from Mrs.
Smart. The doctors pressed on, and when the lights came on, it was
clear that Mrs. Smart was dangerously bloated, the Department of
Health report said.
</P>
<P>
   Smart was told his wife needed to be taken to the hospital's
emergency room. Frightened, he took a quick glance at her. What he
saw, he said, was too awful to describe.
</P>
<P>
   The Versapoint used saline, which gives it a great advantage
over older machines because of the ease with which the body can
drain saline. The Versapoint is intended to make this already safe
procedure for removing the tumor almost foolproof, experts say. But
state records indicate that Mrs. Smart was pumped with 9,000 cubic
centimeters _ or about nine liters _ of saline. That is more than
twice what is generally used, said Dr. Martin Weisberg, clinical
associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect there are no fatalities with this device,''
said Weisberg, who has used the machine. ``By virtue of the fact it
works with saline it makes it safer. The amount was the issue.
Normally we stop at three liters. Maybe I would go to four.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smart had entered the operating room at about 2 p.m. By
8:30, after suffering cardiac arrest from a fluid imbalance, she
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the state first released its report two weeks ago, Beth
Israel officials made few public comments. But the hospital had
already made extensive policy changes. ``We are determined to do
everything necessary to make sure it never happens again,'' said
Matthew Fink, the hospital's president.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment that is not authorized for use rarely makes its way
into the operating room, administrators insist, but now it is even
more difficult. New equipment now must make its way through more
channels, and the supervising nurse in the operating room has had
equipment added to a list of things she must account for.
</P>
<P>
   While Beth Israel insists that medical supply company
representatives were never allowed to touch equipment during
procedures, their presence in the operating room will be more
closely monitored now.
</P>
<P>
   Salesman and other company representatives are not uncommon in
the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally when sales people are present in the O.R. it is
usually a positive thing,'' said Weisberg of Thomas Jefferson.
``You are using new equipment that sometimes behaves in a way you
are not familiar with, and it is a real advantage when you get
someone from the company to take you through. They obviously should
never be doing procedure or helping,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, experts said, salesman have become more visible
in medical settings as competition for sales has increased, in part
because of cost-conscious hospitals' aggressive pursuit of volume
discounts. A spokeswoman for Ethicon Inc., Susan Odenphal, the unit
of Johnson &AMP; Johnson that makes the Versapoint, maintains that
Myers never touched the equipment during surgery, and was
authorized to have the machine in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been changes in the way fluid is managed in
operations. Now, as is standard practice at many hospitals, fluid
inputs and outputs must be recorded every 15 minutes, and any time
input exceeds 1,500 cc or more, the surgeons must be notified and
the procedure halted.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would likely have had little bearing on the outcome,
Beth Israel is in agreement with the Health Department that the
rights of patients are violated when they are not informed about
who will be in the operating room and what equipment will be used.
As such, it has tightened its consent procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these changes trouble some doctors at Beth Israel.
``If you are using a new brand of stapler to sew them up, do you
tell them?'' said one Beth Israel doctor. ``If you're just using a
different machine but basically doing the same thing, do you need
to tell people then? Where is the line of informed consent?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people involved with the case have been disciplined
as well. Sklar lost his privileges at the hospital, and he recently
left the Park Avenue practice. Klinger, who was at first given two
weeks' probation, last week was put on 100 percent restriction,
meaning that a Beth Israel attending doctor must be with him on all
cases. The delay in this disciplinary action was caused by a lack
of full information about the case, Beth Israel executives said.
</P>
<P>
   One nurse was dismissed and two were temporarily suspended,
because, hospital administrators say, they failed to report their
concerns to their superiors at the hospital. And though its action
was not specifically related to the Smart case, the hospital last
week pressed Swersky into resigning his privileges; Beth Israel
said it had been dissatisfied with his work during his probation.

COMMENTARY: A SPOONFUL OF TRAINING FOR THE NANNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCARSDALE, N.Y. _ Marie Schwartz is a working mom. When she
comes home from her day as a marketing executive, she wants to
spend time with her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the worst time to start cooking,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That is why she enrolled her nanny in Sandy Failla's cooking
class for nannies, one of those ingenious, improvised services that
cater to the exotic needs of affluent suburbanites at the end of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it least stressful if I delegated responsibility for
cooking dinner to my nanny,'' Ms. Schwartz explained. ``I could
find out about how school was and give my kids my full attention,
as opposed to half my attention while I'm chopping carrots.''
</P>
<P>
   The nanny has become the glue of upscale American life. Her
presence allows husbands and wives to pursue ambitions in banking,
corporate law and other industries in which the pay is as high as
the workdays are long. A nanny also frees stay-at-home mothers for
the full-time task of chauffeuring children to violin lessons,
hockey games, tae kwon do classes and the other activities demanded
of a child gearing up for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   When the nanny quits or even takes a day off, panic can ensue on
the scale of, say, a bankruptcy or a divorce. In fact, a nanny's
departure can lead to bankruptcy or divorce. That is why suburban
couples prosperous enough to fix most everyday discomforts make
sure their nannies are content and up to speed. They pay for
driving lessons, college classes, immigration lawyers. They equip
nannies with beepers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for Mrs. Failla's cooking classes, which cost $440 for
instruction in making chicken cutlets, meatballs and advanced
sauces, has a self-interested motive.
</P>
<P>
   Nannies are hired for their way with children, not their
casseroles. But for families who can afford to be choosy, cooking
for the grown-ups as well as the kids often becomes part of the
job. Some nannies have a limited repertoire; others know Polish or
Caribbean dishes that American kids may not fancy. Traci Bentzen,
Ms. Schwartz's nanny, is a vegetarian working for meat eaters.
</P>
<P>
   For such problems, Mrs. Failla, a spirited woman of 39, comes to
the rescue. Having tabled a nursing career, she knows of the
pressures on moms, because she spends afternoons ferrying her own
three children to Brownie groups and play dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you put a kitchen in a car, you won't have dinner on
the table as a suburban mom,'' says Mrs. Failla, who also holds
classes for moms.
</P>
<P>
   So at 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Failla is in her home kitchen in Scarsdale
showing four nannies how to make minestrone, Tuscan bread soup,
lentil soup and chicken broth with tortellini. She tells these
immigrants from Poland, Guyana and Colombia that ``the Italian meal
is like a communion _ it's where the family gets together.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lessons are sprinkled with ideas for happy meals for
children, who she notes can be particular about color and texture.
``Just when you get them eating tomato sauce, they decide they
don't like bread,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also provides culinary tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash spinach well. ``You can get a whole sandbox out of it,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use canned tomatoes in the winter. ``Fresh tomatoes tend to be
on the cardboard-tasting side.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use measuring cups. ``You use a handful of this and a
handful of that and you will get a beautiful soup,'' she says.
</P>

ANALYSIS: TIDE TURNS IN THE TOBACCO WARS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The $206 billion tobacco settlement that emerged Friday,
designed to resolve state claims over health costs related to
smoking, is a creation of state attorneys general, with no
involvement by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   As such, and unlike earlier efforts to craft a more
comprehensive settlement, it does not deal with the issue that
cigarette makers have feared most: regulation of their industry by
the federal Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely because it only involves state governments, the
latest settlement proposal is also likely to return the focus of
the nation's debate over smoking back where many people believe it
belongs, to Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk that the latest proposal is a watered-down
version of the earlier efforts and represents diminishing political
will on the part of anti-smoking advocates, the White House and
Congress in recent months have shown little political determination
on the issue as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the defeat last spring of a Senate bill that would have
cost the industry $516 billion, the Clinton administration, which
supported the legislation, has done little more than use the
tobacco industry as a convenient punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's recent gestures have been largely symbolic and
empty. It warned producers, for example, that it will track sales
to young smokers by brand (something that has been done for years
by academics) and added that it would speed up the release of
internal cigarette company documents over the Internet (many of
those papers are already available).
</P>
<P>
   Many anti-smoking advocates believed that the proposed Senate
bill would have brought about a sea change in the nation's war on
smoking. But now, they appear to accept that change, as it has in
the past, will come about incrementally.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are chapters,'' said Dr. David Kessler, the former FDA
commissioner. ``You don't solve huge public issues in a single
swipe. This is going to take a series of steps.''
</P>
<P>
   And anti-smoking groups say the next step should be by the White
House. They hope that the Clinton administration, in light of a
recent court ruling denying the FDA authority over tobacco, will
move quickly to propose tobacco legislation when a new session of
Congress convenes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $206 billion settlement, which could be announced
on Monday, is also a stark reminder that every political idea has a
half-life, a moment when its proponents can seize the stage and try
to force change before the public's attention moves on.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that such a moment had arrived for
smoking opponents. Seizing on the $368.5 billion settlement accord
reached in June 1997 between cigarette makers and 40 state
attorneys general, they helped fashion the $516 billion Senate
bill. That measure would have sharply caused cigarette prices to
rise, given the government regulatory power over tobacco, and
denied the industry the reason it sought the June accord, legal
protections in smoking-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-smoking groups, in a fevered rush to vanquish a
despised enemy, badly miscalculated their strength. Tobacco
companies, long skilled at defeating legislation, unleashed a $50
million advertising blitz that quickly sank the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the tide has turned. The latest court rulings have
consistently run in the industry's favor. And some anti-smoking
groups appeared to have lost their focus. Last year, their message
centered on saving the legions of under-age smokers who faced early
deaths from horrible diseases like lung cancer and emphysema. These
days, they are warning the public about a tie between smoking and
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   By its nature, the impact of the new plan on youth smoking may
be limited because its addresses the problem through social
engineering, not science. Tobacco billboards will come down. Caps
bearing brand logos will become collectors' items. Producers will
promise to clean up their acts. And advertisements like the one
being shown in Florida that depict cigarette makers as mass
murderers may become common fare. (The proposal does contain $250
million to finance a foundation that will research why teen-agers
find cigarettes so attractive and what can be done about it.)
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement will require the approval of most of the
46 states that either have lawsuits to recover smoking-related
health care costs or have yet to sue. (Four states _ Florida,
Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _ have already settled their
cases.)
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement's watered-down nature has prompted some
anti-smoking advocates to urge the state officials to rethink their
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of California at
San Francisco and an anti-tobacco advocate, said that he believed
that states could wring far more concessions from the tobacco
industry by battling in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strategy should go back to dealing with these lawsuits
state by state,'' Glantz said.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general may choose not to heed such views. Many
of them have spent litte time preparing their lawsuits and even
those who have know that they are based on tested and novel legal
theories. Even the case that advanced furthest in trial,
Minnesota's lawsuit, was settled just as it went to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most states, who will have about a week to consider
the new deal, are expected to accept. A few that have worked hard
to prepare their lawsuits, like Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan
and Wisconsin, may balk and bargain for stiffer terms. But for such
officials, the decision between taking billions of dollars in free
money for their states and rolling the dice against the industry in
court may prove to be their last decision in this round of the
tobacco wars.

JAZZ PIANIST FOUND DEAD IN NEW YORK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police are awaiting a medical examiner's report to
determine what caused the death of Kenny Kirkland, the jazz
pianist, who was found dead Friday morning in his home in
Springfield Gardens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Officers discovered Kirkland's body at 2:10 a.m. on Friday after
neighbors reported an odor coming from the house he rented at
181-03 45th Avenue, in Queens County. The Daily News reported
Saturday that drug paraphernalia had been found near the body, but
police would not confirm that Saturday or discuss details of their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland, who began playing piano at age 6 and studied at the
Manhattan School of Music, was a much-sought-after session man in
New York whose reputation was buoyed by stints in bands headed by
Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Sting and the alto saxophonist Kenny
Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   At the Iridium, a jazz club on 63rd Street in Manhattan where
Kirkland was featured, news of his death was greeted with shock.
``I'm so sorry to hear it,'' said Pinot, the club's assistant
manager, who gave only his first name. ``He was a really great
pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sting, Kirkland stepped away from jazz, recording several
albums and traveling the world playing a blend of fused funk.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland also had a short career on television as part of
Branford Marsalis' ``Tonight Show'' band. When Marsalis left the
show, Kirkland returned to his career in New York, playing in
various jazz clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In August he appeared in the Panasonic Village Jazz Festival as
part of Marsalis' jazz quartet. Reviewing the performance in The
New York Times, the critic Ben Ratliff wrote, ``For a stretch
toward the end of the set, the music was as funky as jazz gets
these days, without changing genres altogether or resorting to a
James Brown imitation.''

OUTDOORS: THE WAR OVER BLUEFIN TUNA LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY PAUL MOLYNEAUX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery has
been one of the most hotly debated fisheries in the world. As the
annual meeting of the International Convention for the Conservation
of Atlantic Tunas begins Sunday in Santiago de Compostela, Spain,
contention is rising over such issues as quota reductions and a
lack of compliance with existing agreements. According to United
States delegates, American fishermen are shouldering the brunt of
the conservation effort, while European nations are cashing in on
the Atlantic bluefin fishery.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Japan has offered U.S. commercial fishermen a
strong market for giant bluefin. In the past, prices for
high-quality tuna, which have averaged about 400 pounds when landed
in U.S. waters, have sometimes topped $63 a pound. Single fish,
which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds, are reported to have
fetched $30,000 on the dock and been resold for $80,000 in Japan,
where 90 percent of the world's bluefin catch is consumed. With
many fisheries in decline, the influx of cash from bluefin sales
has helped keep many economies _ personal and national _ healthy
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Stevens fishes commercially for giant bluefin tuna in the
harpoon category, one of five management categories established by
the National Marine Fisheries Service for the allocation of the
U.S. quota. He runs his 35-foot Heidi Marie out of Ogunquit, Maine.
Rigged with a mast for the spotter and a long platform off the bow,
the ``pulpit'' for the harpooner, Stevens' boat is typical of those
in the harpoon fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has been fishing for tuna all his life. ``I went with my
father when I was a kid, then in 1979 I went with a fellow named
Timmy Tower,'' he said. ``He put me onto a big one and I threw _ my
first fish _ and I got him. I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Stevens, Jimmy Donofrio, executive director of the New
Jersey-based Recreational Fishermen's Alliance, is passionate about
this fishery. ``The fishery for small bluefin in the mid-Atlantic
states goes back to the days of sail,'' Donofrio said. ``Around the
turn of the century, they used to troll for bluefin with catboats
and land between 15,000 and 20,000 tons in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for that kind of quota today, but people
have a longstanding right to fish for recreation and subsistence,''
Donofrio said. ``All we want is a reasonable bag limit. We consider
four fish per vessel reasonable. A catch-and-release fishery is not
going to satisfy us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial decision, the National Marine Fisheries
Service listed bluefin tuna as ``overfished'' and, in response to a
congressional stock-rebuilding mandate, may call for a U.S.
reduction of up to 77 percent. The issues affecting domestic
management of bluefin range far beyond U.S. waters. Bluefin can
swim at up to 55 mph and their trans-Atlantic crossings have been
well documented.
</P>
<P>
   Originally managed as one stock, since 1981 Atlantic bluefin
tuna have been considered by the International Convention for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, known as ICCAT, as two separate
stocks: one in the East, with its spawning grounds in the
Mediterranean Sea, and one in the West, thought to spawn
exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. For management purposes the two
stocks are divided by an arbitrary line drawn down the middle of
the Atlantic along the 45th meridian. ICCAT currently assumes there
is only minimal (3 percent) mixing between Eastern and Western
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this separate-management scenario, known as the
Two-Stock Theory, countries in the East have been landing record
catches _ more than 40,000 metric tons in four of the last five
years _ while the United States, Canada and Japan share a Western
quota of 2,354 metric tons. American fishermen get 1,344 metric
tons, 3 percent of the total Atlantic catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Two-Stock Theory was a political decision,'' said Dick
Stone, formerly a fisheries service scientist and now science
adviser to the Recreational Fisherman's Alliance. ``We couldn't get
the Europeans to go along with strict conservation measures so we
split the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Ruais, executive director of the East Coast Tuna
Association, calls the Two-Stock Theory ``an international joke,
and a tragic joke on U.S. fishermen. The fish we conserve are
feeding an expanding fishery in the East. While we abide by catch
and size restrictions, countries like Spain, Portugal and France
are estimated to be fishing well over their quotas,'' he said. ``In
the Bay of Biscay, off the west coast of France, 50 percent of the
catch is undersized, much of it age 0 fish, that's less than four
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of crippling quota reductions, many
commercial and recreational fishermen, often at odds over domestic
allocation, are joining forces and calling on science to help them
challenge the validity of the Two-Stock Theory. All agree that they
have done their share for conservation and that it's time for
Eastern Atlantic countries to share the cost of rebuilding bluefin
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   To analyze movement trends of bluefin, a research project
conducted by Dr. Molly Lutcavage of the New England Aquarium in
Boston, with the aid of commercial fishermen and financial support
from the East Coast Tuna Association, tagged 20 bluefin off
Massachusetts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were criticized for working with commercial fishermen,''
said Lutcavage. ``But how could you not work with commercial
fishermen? They're the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Block of Stanford University, in conjunction with
the recreational fishery off Cape Hatteras, N.C., undertook a
similar, more extensive project involving more than 200 fish. Both
studies used ``pop-up tags,'' designed to release from the tuna
after a specific period of time _ sometimes up to nine months _ and
transmit data, via satellite, back to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Results from Lutcavage's work, though limited, are being used to
challenge the current management system. Of 20 tags attached to
spawning-age fish, 8-plus years old, 17 have been retrieved. After
nine months, five fish had crossed into the Eastern management
area, nearly 30 percent, 10 times what ICCAT assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Block's work, although designed mostly to test the technology,
shows similar movement trends. Most of her fish were tagged with
long-term archival tags, but out of 37 tags released, 35 were
retrieved, and two bluefin had crossed into the Eastern management
area after only 90 days, the maximum time period of Block's pop-up
tags.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wilmot, chairman of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign, a
coalition of environmental groups including the Audubon Society,
World Wildlife Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, is
not convinced. ``There is still too much uncertainty,'' he said.
``As a scientist, I would be very reluctant to make important
management decisions based on a handful of tags. It'll be another
five years of research before we really begin to understand bluefin
stock structure and spawning habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmot notes that a lack of conservation action in the past has
led to disastrous results in other fisheries. ``If the U.S. wants
to show it's serious, then we've got to take a leadership role by
calling for catch reductions. Inaction by other countries is no
excuse for shirking our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   John Graves, chairman of the U.S. ICCAT advisory committee, has
already made it clear that the pop-up tag surveys will not affect
this year's bluefin stock assessment. But he has also stated
unequivocally that the United States is going to be calling for
stiff penalties against any country that continues to plunder this
international resource.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions with U.S. representatives, neither Japanese nor
Canadian delegates have clarified their positions on possible quota
reductions. However, Pat Chamut, Canada's assistant deputy minister
for fisheries management, did say that ``Canadian fishermen will be
less likely to go along with further restrictions unless something
is done to bring the East in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamut called ICCAT's inability to limit catches in the East
``appalling and disgraceful.'' He said Canada would support
sanctions against countries not in compliance with ICCAT
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western management area, bluefin stocks appear to be
rebounding. National Marine Fisheries Service scientists
acknowledge that there is a greater abundance of tuna than
expected, but insist that stocks are at least 80 percent below the
optimum levels called for in the 1996 congressional mandate for
sustainable fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   The best U.S. rebuilding efforts however, will affect only a
small percentage of the Atlantic-wide stock. Most parties, even
many European scientists, agree that the conservation of bluefin
tuna hinges in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. Whether ICCAT
can control all its countries, and end overfishing and the
targeting of undersized fish, remains to be seen.

REAL ESTATE: IN VERMONT SKI COUNTRY, MORE ROOMS, COSTLIER HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOWE, Vt. _ Visitors to the ski regions of Vermont this winter
will find more accommodations and _ for those considering the
purchase of a newly built vacation home _ higher prices than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Stowe, a 235-year-old village with a red-brick town
hall, whitewashed churches and the majestic Mount Mansfield for
skiing, several of the 55 inns and hotels are adding a total of
about 60 new rooms to their stock of 2,500, said Leland Darrow, the
town's zoning administrator.
</P>
<P>
   While new homes are being developed at a slower pace than in the
'80s, they are now larger and more luxurious. As a result, in the
last three years alone, prices have risen to an average of
$233,000, up from $170,000. The high end of the market is reaching
ever more lofty terrain, with new-home prices as high as $5
million, Darrow said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Mount Mansfield at Smuggler's Notch Resort,
about 60 new condominium units _ both apartments and town houses _
have been developed or are near completion this year in six
buildings, said Bill Stritzer, the owner of the resort. When not
being used by their owners, many of the 400 units at the resort are
rented out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been our best year for sales and rentals since
1985,'' Stritzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate activity in Vermont reflects the pattern at ski
resorts around the country, according to Stacy Gardner, spokeswoman
for the National Ski Areas Association in Lakewood, Colo. Real
estate investments rose to $136 million in the 1997/1998 ski season
at 148 resorts across the country that were surveyed by the
association, Ms. Gardner said. That was up from $49 million a year
earlier, she said. This winter, investments are expected to reach
$314 million, the association estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``As skiers get older, they are wealthier, have more free time
and are bringing along children and grandchildren who are at the
right entry age for skiing and snowboarding,'' said Ms. Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Okemo and Killington are two family-friendly,
pedestrian-oriented resorts that exemplify the effort by developers
to capture this market.
</P>
<P>
   Okemo Mountain Inc., about 80 miles south of Stowe in the town
of Ludlow, has developed 60 condominium apartments and town houses
this year at a subdivision called Solitude Village, said Pam
Cruickshank, spokeswoman for the development. All of these units,
priced from $150,000 to $350,000, have been sold. In addition, 19
one-acre single-family house lots are now being developed and will
soon go on sale for $250,000 to $500,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Okemo is also investing $17.5 million to build an entire new
section called the Jackson Gorge. It is to be a resort village with
new ski lifts and trails, shops and a hotel with 200 to 300 suites,
all within walking distance, Ms. Cruickshank said.
</P>
<P>
   At Killington, about 20 miles north of Okemo, a major redesign
is being planned by the owner, American Ski Co., based in Bethel,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   When first designed in the late '60s, the car was king at
Killington. From their accommodations, skiers had to drive to
stores and entertainment facilities. But on 1,000 acres that
American Ski has acquired through a land swap with the state, it is
planning a compact, pedestrian-oriented village with direct access
to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Although still going through the state and local approval
process, the project's total development cost is estimated at about
$300 million, said Christpher Howard, American Ski's director of
real estate operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to start construction in the spring of 2000 on
the first $75 million phase of this project. It is likely to
include a village core with 100 new hotel rooms added to an
existing 203-room hotel, 200 hotel-style time-share units and about
100,000 square feet of retail space. The aim is to attract more
skiers and convert Killington into a four-season resort, Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   In creating these villages, Okemo and Killington are striving to
boost revenues by constructing the type of year-round resort town
ambiance that has evolved in Stowe over a century.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, Stowe was a summer resort for affluent
New Englanders and New Yorkers. In the late 1930s, it introduced
skiing, and in the 1950s when foliage trips became popular, more
people started heading there in the fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation-home development started in the '70s and by the '80s it
was in full swing. About 400 condominiums and 500 single-family
primary and vacation homes were built. In the peak year of 1987
alone, 99 single-family homes went up. Now, this town of 3,400
year-round residents has 1,200 single-family homes, 600 vacation
homes and about 500 condominium apartments, Darrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, single-family-home development has predominated,
with about 30 houses going up each year. At present, most new homes
have a buyer before construction begins and buyers are tending to
choose larger, more elaborate homes suitable for year-round use.
When the owner isn't there, the homes are often rented out to
vacationers by real estate brokers or by the resort of which they
are a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new homes are custom built, loaded with gadgets and a lot
more expensive,'' said Darrow. Million-dollar vacation getaways are
no longer unusual but most new homes sell for $300,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   A state law that went into effect in June has raised property
taxes for affluent communities in order to raise spending for
education in poorer communities and offer tax relief to low-income
households. In Stowe the effect has been to raise property taxes by
about 30 percent. A house worth about $200,000 will now pay $3,200
a year instead of $2,360.
</P>
<P>
   The tax rate has not hampered resort expansion, however,
according to Darrow. ``People come here to vacation or retire, they
don't care about taxes and costs,'' he said. ``Also, compared with
places they come from, like Boston or New York, real estate is
relatively inexpensive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For instance, this fall W. Richard Leuck sold a $240,000 second
home here that he had purchased for $190,000 a year and a half
earlier. He is now building a $400,000, five-bedroom house on a
nine-acre lot, hoping some day to live there six months a year. But
at present he and his family retreat here for one week stays
throughout the year. During the summer they stay for two months.
``There's so much going on here, I don't know who plans all the
activities,'' said Leuck, an investment banker based in Parkland,
Fla. On the other hand, he loves the solitude. ``In Vermont, you
have the freedom to just be with nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the environmental integrity of this region _ under
the current battle cry of ``limiting sprawl'' _ has become a
requirement of new developments statewide. To further the goal,
Stowe has installed a new sewer line.
</P>
<P>
   The sewer line is vital for future development, said Robert
Apple, planning director of Mount Mansfield Co., a division of
American International Group. ``It allows us to create a compact
core rather than spread out to install other types of wastewater
facilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its Stowe Mountain Resort, the company is now planning to
improve ski facilities and develop perhaps 500 luxury hotel and
residential units, at a cost of about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several other inns and hotels are already building new
accommodations. The 92-room Topnotch at Stowe Resort &AMP; Spa has
completed site preparation on its grounds for six buildings with 18
new 2,000-square-foot condominiums priced at about $400,000.
Construction is scheduled to start next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite higher taxes or a weaker stock market, Robert Boyle, the
president of Topnotch, said he was confident that the project would
find buyers. ``The resort lifestyle attracts people,'' he said.

REAL ESTATE: A MARKET WITH FEWER THRILLS, AND CHILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  
(lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In bemused tones, the Oct. 19 internal memo from the
chairman of the Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy residential brokerage
to his company's 110 sales agents said: ``We actually have sellers
out there deciding whether to accept offers and buyers deciding
whether they should make an offer based on what the Dow is doing
that morning or afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, a whole month ago in the day-to-day slalom ride of
the financial markets, there were reports of luxury-apartment
buyers walking away from million-dollar deposits, of jittery
sellers _ visions of precipitous decline dancing in their heads _
lopping off 20 percent or more of their asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is silly,'' the brokerage chairman, David
Michonski, wrote in his memo.
</P>
<P>
   And many observers and players in the New York regional
residential market would concur, especially with the Dow having
recovered substantially from its 513-point Aug. 31 plunge.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the stock-market gyrations and the profound problems
plaguing some foreign economies have dampened the heat of a
feverish residential market and muffled the drums of bidding wars.
But those dampening developments appear to be limited _ at least
for now _ to the high end of the Manhattan market, to the new
residential buildings of the downtown financial district and to the
most affluent enclaves of New York City's suburban ring.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader residential market, both national and regional,
where the fundamentals buttressing home buying _ high employment,
low inflation and low mortgage rates _ remain firm, middle-class
and working-class buyers continue to keep the real-estate business
percolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market starts to bump,'' said Edward Lee Cave,
chairman of the high-end Manhattan brokerage that bears his name,
``the very rich feel less rich. Their Wall Street shares have
appreciated about 80 percent over the last four or five years.
They've now gone down 20 to 30 percent. So instead of saying they
are 50 percent richer than they were before, they are saying they
are 30 percent poorer. That's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, what the luxury market has seen in the last few months,
said Clark Halstead, founder of Halstead Property Co., ``has been
an emotional reaction to the world economic crisis, rather than a
real economic phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   As one high-end New Jersey broker, Michele Kolsky-Assatly of
Coldwell Banker's Fort Lee office, said, ``There is a reserved
nervousness in the market.'' And she told of a Fort Lee home that
had been on the market for 235 days while the owner held out for a
bid of $1.25 million, then, in August, accepted an offer of $1.14
million.
</P>
<P>
   But in the more down-to-earth Bronx, one leading brokerage, ERA
Besmatch, is reporting the sale of 450 properties so far this year,
compared with less than 400 by this time in 1997, and a demand that
increased the average price for the homes it handles in
neighborhoods like Wakefield, Williamsbridge and Pelham from
$161,000 a year ago to $166,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, Judy Young, manager of Market Place Realty,
complained, ``I have customers, but nothing to show them,''
pointing out that a house in Flushing, listed one day two weeks ago
at $270,000, had sold the following day for $279,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service recorded more
sales in the third quarter of this year than in any previous
quarter, an increase of 20 percent over the third quarter of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, sales were up 10 percent during the first nine
months of this year, compared with the corresponding period in
1997. And two Sundays ago, at the grand opening of a 37-unit
town-house development in Smithtown, where prices ranged from
$210,000 to $235,000, ``people were lined up with checks in their
hand,'' according to the developer, Steven Klar, and about 18 units
were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silliness is still with us,'' Michonski of Coldwell Banker
Hunt Kennedy said last week, ``but it's abating as people look
beyond the weekly valleys to more important and stable factors of
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those factors, Michonski said, are suburban buyers, single
people seeking starter apartments and the steady flow of
immigrants. ``Few people realize that we are at a 100-year high in
immigration,'' Michonski said, ``and what immigrants provide is
first-time home buyer support in key markets. Now that's not as
sexy as the Manhattan real-estate market, but neighborhood after
neighborhood is being revitalized by these immigrants, who save
more and have a stronger desire for home ownership than
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, certainly, some pale spots in the rosy picture. As in
any volatile time, people think two or three times about making a
major purchase. ``We don't feel yet that the pace of sales has been
hit significantly and prices haven't come down,'' said Jacob
Shayovitz, president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors, ``but I
think it's slowing down a bit. The word on the street is `Maybe
I'll hold off a bit and see what happens tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, Diana Hughes, a broker with Preferred
Properties in Stamford, said: ``People are thinking twice. Some
people backed out of deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Other market observers, however, point out that any indications
of a slowdown have come at a time _ in the fall _ when real-estate
sales traditionally take a breather. And it is during such spells
that prices moderate toward more realistic levels and buyers become
more serious.
</P>
<P>
   The lower end of the market is more affected by mortgage rates
than stock prices, said Liz Lindsey, owner of Lindsey Real Estate
in Mount Vernon, N.Y. ``Our buyers look at housing as shelter, not
an investment.'' And even in tonier Scarsdale, Audrey Rapaport,
manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence brokerage there, said two weeks
ago, ``Whenever the market's down, the traffic you get tends to be
the serious buyers, and that's what we're seeing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning the residential market are some of the firmest
fundamentals in decades. Barring the unforeseen, in 16 days, on
Dec. 1, the nation will break the record for the longest peacetime
economic expansion in history, the 92 months of growth between 1982
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates, now hovering at about 7 percent, have been low
and stable for most of this year, setting a 31-year low of 6.68
percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan during the week that ended
Oct. 9. That 6.68 percent low, compared with the year's high of
7.28 percent for the week that ended May 1, marked the narrowest
annual range for mortgage rates _ .60 percent _ since the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH
Associates, a Butler, N.J., firm that tracks mortgage rates, ``it's
instructive to note, in the midst of volatility in the financial
markets, that we have had tremendous stability this year in
mortgage interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, according to projections calculated by the National
Association of Realtors, 1998 is forecast to be the third year in a
row that the nation sets a record for sales of existing homes.
There were 4.1 million sales in 1996 and 4.2 million last year, and
4.7 million are expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have,'' said James Hughes, dean of the School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, ``is an
extraordinarily powerful national home market, and that is
certainly the overlying market reality for the region.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hughes offered allegorical allusions to recent stages of the
market: ``First, we had a Goldilocks economy _ not too strong, not
too weak, just right. That was over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past nine months or so, overlaying the Goldilocks economy,
has been an Alfred E. Newman economy _ `What me worry?' _ after we
first had the Asian financial crisis about this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And since the stock-market swoon, we've had a Jekyll and Hyde
economy: It still has great underlying fundamentals, but we have an
increasingly worrisome dark side. And that's related to the impacts
of the world financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Hughes said, the New York area is less exposed to
the effects of foreign crises than other sections of the country.
``The areas most hard hit are those that export manufactured goods,
such as Seattle _ Boeing has lost a lot of airline orders _ and
those that export food to Asia,'' he noted. The major local effect,
he said, has been ``the stock-market swoon, and we haven't yet seen
its impact on the broad housing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tony sectors certainly now have the jitters,'' Hughes
said. ``But the broad middle market is less impacted because the
driving force there really is a maturing baby-boom generation
trading up, positioning themselves in communities where they want
to raise their children and live for a long time. For them, this is
not a discretionary item, like moving from a $2 million house to a
$4 million house.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some less obvious nuances to the New York area's
residential market, said Rae Rosen, senior regional economist at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ``It is a very strong housing
market,'' she said, ``but this region has been one of the weaker
areas of the country in terms of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   One barometer of that fact is relatively moderate price
appreciation, except in the most affluent communities. ``For
existing homes, price increases are lagging the nation in
percentage terms,'' Ms. Rosen said. For example, in the first half
of this year, according to data published by the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight, prices in New Jersey rose by slightly
less than 4 percent, compared with 5 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate price appreciation, however, is not necessarily bad
news. ``In the '80s, prices nearly tripled in the metropolitan
area,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``So the silver lining is that we improve
our competitive position.''
</P>
<P>
   For most people, one truism holds, Ms. Rosen said _ the ability
to buy depends on their current job and salary. ``When you're
talking about people who work for Wall Street, their ability to
purchase the mansion of their dreams may be crimped,'' she said.
``But for most people _ the rest of us middle-class people _ the
thing that's driving it is job growth and low interest rates, and
that's holding so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in high-end Manhattan _ so noosed to the year-end bonus and
the quarterly report _ the financial tremors have not loosened a
trap door under the residential market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a downturn in prices,'' said Barbara Corcoran,
chairwoman of Corcoran Group. ``What we have seen, and this is
based on my own business, is that people had a knee-jerk reaction
to the 500-point drop on Aug. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, ``five out of our 51 contracts due to be signed
were just not signed,'' Ms. Corcoran said. ``I can't recall such a
quick reaction borne out of sheer fear.'' September was marked by
price reductions and far fewer multiple bids, she said, but by
mid-October, ``We had a tremendous uptick in activity.'' In the
month since, the Dow has crept upward, even flitting near the 9,000
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The 513-point drop on Aug. 31 represented a 6 percent decline in
the Dow. Eleven years ago, on Oct. 19, 1987 _ so-called Black
Monday _ there had also been a 500-plus decline in the Dow. But at
the time, those 508 points represented a 22.6 percent stock-market
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, said Halstead of Halstead Property Co., ``unlike what
we had in 1987, when there were 90 days of total paralysis in our
office, just no new deals, the real-estate market has continued
through these gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be an isolated case or two of people not abandoning
contracts but reneging on verbal price agreements,'' Halstead said.
``No one has abandoned their deposit and run for the hills. On the
other hand, we have had some sellers reduce their asking prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave, of the brokerage bearing his name, said, however, that he
had heard of instances where buyers walked away from deposits _
``two instances: one was $400,000 and the other about a million.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``If it was rife in the industry, I would have
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The essential well-being of even the sometimes immoderate luxury
market was validated by the most recent findings of the Douglas
Elliman Manhattan Market Report, the most comprehensive analysis
available.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal
company that prepares the Elliman report, said that there were
2,214 verified sales of co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan during
the third quarter of this year, a 9.61 percent increase over the
2,017 transactions recorded for the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we found that the average sales price remained essentially
unchanged,'' Miller said. In the second quarter, the average price
was $529,416, and in the third quarter it was $518,986 _ a 1.97
percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the average number of days on the
market decreased 6.2 percent, from 112 days to 105, and the
discount from asking price (the difference between the last list
price and the sale price) declined 14.02 percent _ ``meaning that
the sales price was 14 percent closer to the list price than during
the previous quarter,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If any single sector of the Manhattan market has quickly felt
the effects of the stock market's zigzags it is, not surprisingly,
the downtown financial district, where new apartment buildings have
risen and outmoded office towers have been reborn as residences.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heiberger is president of Citi Habitats, a brokerage that
deals, in his words, ``with 20- to 30-somethings, would-be
purchasers who work in the Wall Street area and are not only making
large salaries but get commissions and bonuses that usually
represent two or three times their base salary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pulling in their horns, sitting and waiting,''
Heiberger said. ``Especially in the upper end, they are either
staying put or are going to rent for a year and then look.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiberger said that since Merrill Lynch announced the layoff of
3,400 workers on Oct. 13, the number of sales inquiries at his
offices for the upper end of the downtown market _ the
condominium-loft buildings in TriBeCa, the far West Village and the
financial district _ have just about halved. ``Six months ago we
were probably getting 75 inquiries a month for apartments priced
from $400,000 to $1.5 million, and in the last five weeks we've
probably received 45 inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices, however, have not dropped. ``For a typical condo loft in
those neighborhoods, we're still talking $400 to $500 per square
foot, so just the demand is on hold,'' Heiberger said. ``If there
is another two months of stable Wall Street activity, the bidding
wars could return as quickly as they vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding wars, or the lack of them, may not be the most rational
measure of the residential market. But there is a school of thought
that the current jitters and reasonable concerns, especially about
the luxury end, will eventually prove to be a healthy development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, in retrospect,'' said Halstead, ``when we look at
this period three or four months from now and get some data that's
meaningful, we will see that prices stopped ascending and were
level for the first time in a very long time. We needed it, because
the market was overheated and going up too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming there is no global financial meltdown, said Hughes at
Rutgers, ``what we'll really see for the national economy, as we
look forward from here, is a slowing of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a manageable slowdown, and a slight slowing of the
housing market in turn,'' he noted. ``After all, the 1998 housing
market has been the equivalent of the Yankees winning 125 games.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the 1980s, when inflation was rampant, lending was
uninhibited and the real-estate market subverted itself by
overbuilding, ``the hallmark of this expansion has been that there
have been no excesses, no imbalances that caused the expansion to
abort,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one excess which had been developing is the extreme
overexuberance in the high end of the housing market,'' he said.
``And so the effect of the stock-market swoon is to tone down that
excess, and make the whole market much more sustainable in the long
run.''

FIRM-BUT-FAIR HOLZMAN RECEIVES PLAYERS' PRAISE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Ariz.)   (jw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Walt Frazier won championships and was enshrined in the
Hall of Fame, he was a young guard unsure of his place in the
National Basketball Association _ and, one night, fresh off a
horrendous game against the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Holzman changed my career around that night,'' Frazier
said Saturday of his former coach, who died Friday night at the age
of 78. ``He said, `I want you to sit by me on the bus back to New
York.' I sat down and Red said, `What the hell is wrong with you? I
scouted you in college. You're a better player than that.' He kept
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that Red believed in me. It was the
confidence I needed at that time in my career. Looking back, it
seems like he was always saying the right things at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was one of many players and peers who paid homage to
Holzman, the coach who in the early '70s brought the Knicks their
only NBA championships. Described as firm but fair as a coach,
Holzman was remembered not only for his victories but also for the
way in which he won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always admired Red for the way he treated everybody,'' said
Dave DeBusschere, like Frazier a member of both Knick championship
teams in 1970 and 1973. ``He treated you as a professional and he
made it fun. Just to mix it up in practice, he would have these
little shooting games _ the big men against the little men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a great team, but he made us great. He took people
from diverse backgrounds _ extremely diverse _ and became the glue
that put everybody together.''
</P>
<P>
   Former coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said when he arrived in the
league in 1970, Holzman was a role model. ``If I had tried to
pattern myself after anybody,'' Fitzsimmons said, ``it was Red.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wear these big collars because the weather was hot in
Phoenix, but then once Red said to me, `You know, Cotton, as a
coach, you should always wear a tie.' I started wearing a tie. I
always think about that now when I put my tie on. That's the way he
did it. I never reached his heights, but I tried to do it the way
he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzy Levane, who was six months older than Holzman, was one of
Holzman's oldest friends. Levane played against him in the early
1940s while Holzman was at City College and Levane was at St.
John's. They worked at the same restaurant in Schroon Lake, N.Y.,
during the summer. ``He was my busboy and he used to tell me I was
the sloppiest waiter he ever saw,'' Levane said, laughing. ``The
only time I saw him was on Friday when he came around to collect
the tips.''
</P>
<P>
   The two went on to play for the Rochester Royals of the National
Basketball League in 1945, pocketing $1,000 a month for a
five-month season.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their wives and two infant daughters, they shared a
three-bedroom house for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Levane was also responsible for Holzman's first coaching job.
While Levane was coaching Milwaukee, he acquired Holzman in 1953 _
Holzman's last playing season. Holzman succeeded Levane as coach in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   Levane surmised that the death last June of Selma, Holzman's
wife of 55 years, was devastating for his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when Selma died, he really became lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Values of the Game,'' the former Knick and
former Sen. Bill Bradley wrote about Holzman's coaching style. He
wrote of Holzman: ``His attitude was, `No excuses _ none!' Even if
you were late because of circumstances clearly beyond your control,
you got no sympathy or credit.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sure, Bill, I know your mother's cousin called with an
emergency that your mother's nephew couldn't take care of,' Holzman
used to say, `and it rained on the highway and made it slick, after
the earthquake damaged the bridge, but you're still fined.' He
smiled and I paid up.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Frazier, who received the news Saturday in St. Croix, his
home during the off season: ``He was hard, but fair. And what I
liked about him was there was one set of rules for Frazier, Reed,
Bradley, whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fondest memory is him waiting for me in the locker room
after a tough loss. He would say: `C'mon, Clyde, the sun's coming
up tomorrow. I gotta go have my Scotch.' He was a very good and
fair man.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' president and general manager:
``He was our patriarch. He was like a father to many of us.
Whenever you went to the Garden for a game, you knew Red was going
to be there _ Suite 200, sitting at his table. The Knicks were part
of him and Red was part of the Knicks. He'll be a legend forever at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children grew up with him. He was like a grandfather to
them. His life revolved around basketball, but he was so much more
than a coach.''

 REAL ESTATE: WANDERING U.N. AIDE FINDS A HOME IN SOUTH BRONX
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Oglesby had worked overseas in economic
development for the United Nations for 25 years, living in
Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he was back in New York, working at the headquarters
and living in a studio apartment on the Upper West Side. Because he
liked walking, he spent hours roaming through the city's
neighborhoods and found himself charmed by brownstones. He decided
he had to have one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With the eyes of a stranger, he visited places like Brooklyn
Heights, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill. But he had
only $200,000 to spend, and even five years ago, when he really
began his search for a house, they were out of reach. He wanted
something architecturally interesting, and no more than 30 minutes
from midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively quickly, he became enamored of Harlem, attracted to
its atmosphere and its history. But he had no luck. Maybe it was
timing. Maybe he wasn't decisive enough. In 1996, he almost bought
a house in Morningside Valley for $90,000, but while he was
worrying that it would be too complicated to untangle its
problematic certificate of occupancy, someone else bought the
house. Frustrated and disappointed, he gave up.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while, reinvigorated by an article that described
the Mount Morris area in Harlem, he began exploring there. One day
about six months ago, walking on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street, he
approached a man sitting on a stoop and asked him if he knew of any
houses for sale in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The man said no, but he did know of a landmarked block in the
South Bronx with a house for sale. The man, it turned out, was a
real estate broker, and he arranged to show Oglesby the house at
419 E. 140th St. in the Mott Haven section, where most of the
residents are Spanish-speaking. On the day of their appointment,
Oglesby took the Lexington Avenue subway to 138th Street, which is
only 15 minutes from midtown.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself in a place far different from, say, midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shops are very simple, and poor,'' he said, ``with big
plantains and yams and mangoes, not plastic tomatoes. The little
Mexican grocery store has music blaring out, and there are people
hanging out on the street. There is one kind of toothpaste, not
10.''
</P>
<P>
   He had liked the idea of living in Harlem, but never quite felt
accepted. In Mott Haven, he said, he felt like he had come home.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached East 140th Street, which is lined with
well-tended houses of different colors, ``it was suddenly like a
1950s sitcom,'' he said, adding, ``People were tending their
gardens and smiling and talking.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not at all like the Upper West Side. ``There you're lucky
if you get a hello in the elevator,'' he said. In fact, in an
elevator once, making what he considered neighborly conversation,
someone told him that he ``overshares.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at 419 E. 140th St., he found a three-story
brick town house built in 1897, with three fireplaces, a solid
staircase, appealing woodwork, a pretty little garden in front and
a yard in the back. It was structurally sound, with obvious but
fixable flaws. All of the wood floors were covered with linoleum
that seemed to have been applied with glue the strength of steel,
and the walls were obscured with plastic paneling. The ceilings had
been lowered and surfaced with panels.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who live in New York, however, he associated
the South Bronx with devastation, with gangs and knifings and
burned-out housing, even though that image had nothing to do with
what he was seeing. So he went to the local police station and
asked, ``If I were your uncle, would you tell me to live in this
neighborhood?'' They gave him mixed advice. ``One said it's a good
block,'' he recalled. ``Another said, `Don't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He chose to believe in the believers.
</P>
<P>
   Oglesby bought the house for $113,000, which was $6,000 less
than the asking price. He had retired from the United Nations at
the beginning of 1997 when he was 58, but was able to get a
mortgage from the credit agency there, and when the house was
appraised it was valued at $140,000. The taxes are only $595 a
year. It is a landmarked block, and some of the houses, he said,
are elaborate, with marble floors and lavish moldings.
</P>
<P>
   He closed in July, and since then has been working with friends,
many of them from Indonesia, to renovate the building. He has also
hired an Indonesian contractor who is putting in a new kitchen on
the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the main floor, he has exposed gracious 12-foot ceilings. The
center room, once a bathroom, will be his library, and is now being
supplemented with books about the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, he ripped out a closet and discovered a
graceful arched opening that makes the perfect backdrop for his
carved day bed from Thailand. Like all of the furniture collected
during his years in Asia, it can go into a small van, because it is
made from panels. ``These pieces were built before nails,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor, he has turned the front room into his bedroom,
furnishing it with a grand four-poster bed that looks as though it
must have come from his travels, but turns out to have been
recently bought at Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   The back room, a guest bedroom, has, like the main bedroom,
large closets. There is so much space he doesn't know what to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the value of his own labor, or the contributions of
his friends, he figures it will cost about $15,000 to renovate the
house. He will try to fix the outside, which is cracking and
crumbling, with a grant from the New York City Landmarks
Preservation Commission, which gives up to $15,000 per homeowner to
help people of modest means preserve landmarked buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although he sometimes lectures on Asian culture and
international relations as an adjunct professor at schools like
Fordham and New York University, his retirement is giving him time
to take singing lessons and prepare for a cabaret performance.
</P>
<P>
   When he's out at night, he never takes a cab because he knows
too many people who have been in accidents. Instead he takes a bus
that lets him off half a block away or the subway. Even at night,
he says, ``it's not a menacing place.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is quiet. In Mott Haven, he hears church bells on Sunday,
and an occasional rooster. But his friends from Manhattan are
dubious. ``The South Bronx is the kiss of death to them,'' he said.
``The area still has a horrible stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   He has quickly become a part of the neighborhood, getting to
know its quirks, like its profusion of stores selling beepers.
Around the corner, he can buy a good cup of coffee for less than a
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   He has met a lot of people, like the couple down the street who
have lived there for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he dropped off some old clothes at the church up the
street, the pastor reciprocated by giving him a funky lamp with
pink and green glass, which now shares a room with his lacquered
chest from Burma and clay jars from Indonesia. The beat policeman
who is legendary for his good relations with residents stopped by
to introduce himself and spent a half hour touring the house.
</P>
<P>
   When he walks around the neighborhood with a visitor, showing
off the antique shops on Bruckner Boulevard, the new houses selling
for $300,000, and the recently sandblasted facades, people know him
and say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this neighborhood,'' he said, ``oversharing is a virtue.''

 REAL ESTATE: A UNION CLINIC MODERNIZING, BUT KEEPING SOME
TRADITIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The clinic in the sky is coming down closer to earth.
For decades the Union Health Center has occupied six floors near
the top of the 27-story building at 275 Seventh Ave., between 25th
and 26th streets, in an area that is at the confluence of the
Garment District and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The center provides health care for 31,000 active members of the
main clothing workers union and 60,000 retirees in the New York
area. But it has gone without remodeling for more than 30 years and
was designed for a type of assembly-line medicine not in keeping
with modern practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, office tenants being squeezed out of midtown by
rising rents are looking at locations in Chelsea and other areas of
south of midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its eclectic mix of former industrial and
back-office/loft properties, Chelsea now boasts an availability
rate of 2.1 percent, down from 15.8 percent a year ago, and a
rental rate of $31.81 per square foot, a year-over-year increase of
94.3 percent,'' according to a recent report by Newmark &AMP; Company
Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   At 25th Street, 275 Seventh is a little north of the heart of
Chelsea, but the trends in the neighborhood are clear. An old
Veterans Administration ambulatory care center at the southwest
corner of Seventh Avenue and 25th Street is being converted into
housing.
</P>
<P>
   So Union Health is going to vacate the 21st through 26th floors
of the building. The space will be gutted and offered to commercial
customers who are willing to pay for fine views of the Empire State
Building to the east and the Hudson River to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The center might have been moved elsewhere, but the current
location is close to the subway lines that can bring patients in
from their working-class neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, the
Bronx and the West Side of Manhattan. Besides, the labor
organization the center is affiliated with, the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, owns the building,
and the clinic's medical services are closely aligned with the
union's social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The health center is operated as an independent, nonprofit
corporation, said Paul Cheng Jr., the chief financial officer. ``We
are a tenant of the union and we pay rent,'' Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the upper to the lower floors will trim the rent
bill somewhat, said Darrell Halverson, the chief executive of the
center. Halverson added that because of the union ownership the
rent is already somewhat below the market rate, which he said
ranges from about $20 to about $28 a square foot in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When renovations are complete, the center will occupy the
fourth, fifth and part of the sixth floors of the building. Because
of the wedding cake design of the building, the center will occupy
about the same 68,000 square feet it had on five floors in the
tower.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 million project is being financed by the New York State
Dormitory Authority, which is authorized to back nonprofit ventures
in addition to dormitories. ``Starting in January 1999 we will have
a big mortgage we will have to pay back,'' Cheng said. ``As a
nonprofit we could have never afforded conventional financing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower floors are being gutted to adapt a manufacturing
building, which was once known as the Lefcourt Clothing Center, to
the demands of modern medicine. The fourth floor is about one-third
taller than others in the building, suggesting it was built as
showroom space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to new quarters, the leaders of the clinic are using
the interior design to install a new approach to delivering medical
care. ``We are adding services, like obstetrics and gynecology and
pediatrics,'' Halverson said, ``and that affects the architectural
plan.'' He said that the clinic, which dates back to 1911 and
claims to be the oldest union-affiliated health center in the
country, provides care for people who might fall through the cracks
of the city's medical establishment. Just as at the turn of the
century, its patients are largely immigrants, with the difference
that today's immigrants are from Latin America and Asia, rather
than from Italy and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide health care through thick and thin for people who
could not afford it otherwise,'' Halverson said. Indeed, he said,
the drug-resistant tuberculosis of today is reminiscent of the turn
of the century TB outbreaks that led to the founding of the health
center.
</P>
<P>
   The new floors are being designed to accommodate a system of
medical care that emphasizes prevention rather then cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old system was based on a conveyor-belt mentality,''
Halverson said. ``We'd load 40 people on a bus, bring them here and
run everybody through the same series of tests. That was a
misapplication of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is now clear that a 28-year-old Latino male is likely
to have different medical needs than a 50-year-old Asian woman who
has been working for years in a noisy environment where hazardous
chemicals are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have the annual physical by the union doctor,'' he
said, ``and many immigrants thought this was good health care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new approach was much more individual, with a lot
more emphasis on family history and medicines taken and lifestyle.
After conducting these interviews, primary care doctors can order
tests based on each person's likely condition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Taking personal histories and asking questions is a complicated
undertaking given the number of languages spoken by the recent
immigrants. All signs and printed materials in the health centers
are in English, Spanish and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody in primary care is bilingual or trilingual,''
Halverson said. ``But even so, I employ 25 translators.'' He admits
that using translators is less than ideal, even if it is necessary.
``With three people in the room, something gets lost in
translation.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical space will have two of its own elevators to separate
the patients from the rest of the tenants, a task now more or less
performed by lobby guards.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth floor will have a block long waiting room facing on
Seventh Avenue and will be dedicated to primary care. Two sets of
examining rooms are farther back in the building with a secure area
for doctors' offices at the far eastern area.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the examining rooms with be equipped with a computer
terminal on which information on patients, their ailments and
treatments will be displayed. The display will include a picture of
the patient to minimize confusion among patients with similar
names. ``We want to make sure that the Mrs. Yen that's in the room
is the right Mrs. Yen,'' Halverson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the new design has had to provide room for 30,000
paper charts because of the prohibitive cost of entering the old
data into the new system. ``We have tried to move away from paper,
'' Cheng said, ``but paper, like nicotine, is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   All new charts, however, will be electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to reduce delays in moving people
through. If the primary care doctor prescribes medicine, the system
alerts the pharmacy so that medicines will be ready as the patient
is walking out.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth floor, which is connected to the fourth by a steel and
glass staircase (the infirm can always take an elevator) is devoted
to specialty medicine, including a big gym near the offices of
orthopedic specialists and other doctors concentrating on
muscle-skeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big area for workers in an industry where they operate
machinery that often requires moving the hands and arms in the same
motion over and over. This type of work often leads to repetitive
motion disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting physical therapy where it belongs,'' Halverson
said of the gym's location near the doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scope of the problem, Halverson said the union
would often order therapy for workers, even when insurance coverage
was in dispute. ``The union takes people in so they get therapy and
fix the problem,'' he said. ``Afterward they will go after the
employer's insurance. They don't always get paid, but the union
considers that part of its social mission.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude and the union's history of helping immigrants
adapt to a new land helps in staffing the specialists' offices.
Unlike the primary care doctors, who are on salary, the specialists
have independent practices where they can probably make more money
than devoting part of the time to the health center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our specialists are the sons and daughters of
immigrants, whose parents were members of the union,'' Halverson
said. ``They have a lot of loyalty to the union.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the basic objective of the new facility was to give the
working poor something higher-income people take for granted: good
medical care in reasonably pleasant surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a medical home for people who never had one
before,'' Halverson said.

 &HT;    Results of mother's crack use on babies varied, experts say
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A decade ago, when the crack cocaine problem was
new, it seemed easier to categorize ``crack babies.'' It was widely
believed there was a direct cause-and-effect relationship between
prenatal crack exposure and a specific set of birth defects and
developmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   But time and experience have shown that generalizations about
crack-affected children don't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing we've found out, it is there are no
absolutes,'' said Nancy Reder, supervisor of Starting Point,
Montgomery County's centralized intake unit for small children at
risk for abuse, neglect and developmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each child is an individual,'' said Marcie Lickert, a nurse
with the early childhood intervention program at Southview School.
``They are very hard to define.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, the debate has intensified over whether
prenatal crack exposure has serious, lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocaine use by mothers . . . certainly does expose the child
to a potent drug during critical periods of brain development and
physical growth,'' the Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor reported in
August. ``How often such exposure actually occurs, and whether the
exposure has truly serious, or even fatal, health consequences, is
a matter of debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in August, a group of researchers with the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation said the crack babies scare of the 1980s created
a panic that has led to unfair and punitive laws and policies. They
said pregnant crack addicts, most of them blacks, get harsher
treatment than pregnant alcohol abusers, who usually are white,
even though prenatal cocaine exposure is no worse than exposure to
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme courts in several states, including Ohio, barred
prosecuting women based on the harm their drug use could do to
their fetuses. However, the South Carolina Supreme Court went the
other way. The court upheld an eight-year sentence for a woman who
was convicted of child endangerment for using crack while pregnant.
The woman's baby was born healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocates fear such punitive measures will prevent women
from seeking prenatal care and substance abuse treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Local professionals who work with drug-exposed children aren't
ready to dismiss the possibility that exposure has a long-term
impact.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been anecdotal evidence that crack-exposed babies
can be unusually lethargic or irritable and unconsolable as
newborns, that they shun physical contact and are easily
overstimulated by light, activity and noise. As these infants have
grown into toddlers and young children, experts are debating
whether they remain distractible, hyperactive and emotionally
detached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention deficit disorder _ is there a link between that and
the number of kids born drug-affected? I don't know, but that's how
these kids are,'' said Diane Patterson, director of Born Free,
Miami Valley Hospital's treatment program for pregnant substance
abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack in and of itself may not be the huge bogeyman we
thought,'' said Jean Sanders, health services manager for
Montgomery County Children Services. ``(But) very few people use
just one drug. The single biggest lingering effect of this poly
drug use is the detachment to society'' it seems to cause in
addicts' offspring. ``They grow up to be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Such detachment and other developmental problems may have
complex roots that go beyond the direct effects of prenatal drug
exposure, Sanders and other local experts say. The problems may
also stem from poor parenting, the trauma of being removed from
parents and placed in foster homes or lack of bonding between an
irritable, addicted mother and an unconsolable, drug-affected
newborn. It's possible that drug abuse by a baby's father prior to
conception causes developmental problems. Or there may be genetic
causes that have nothing to do with either parent's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to say DNA is the only thing (that causes
developmental problems) or nutrition is the only thing or parenting
is the only thing or drug use is the only thing,'' said Janet
Housenick, supervisor of Nova House's women's rehab program. ``But
it's like a big pot of stew. Of course, the drug use doesn't
help.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems there are fewer newborns with the ``classic''
crack-baby symptoms of irritability and hypersensitivity, Sanders
said. But she theorizes that's because today's crack users often
combine crack with marijuana in ``primo cigarettes.'' The
combination ``doesn't bring them down as much (when the crack
euphoria wears off). Consequently, it doesn't bring the child down
as much at birth, but the impact (on the baby) is worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug-affected babies may not be diagnosed at birth _ or at all.
If they're premature, hospitals care for them just like other
preemies who weren't exposed to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Early-intervention specialists at Starting Point give mothers
calming strategies for their irritable babies, such as tightly
swaddling them in blankets to prevent them from flailing. They
teach mothers to recognize their babies' cues to predict when
they're becoming irritable and comfort them.
</P>
<P>
   Children usually don't carry the crack-baby label for long, and
experts say that's a good thing, even though it makes it more
difficult to track the children's progress. If the label lingered,
teachers and others might pigeonhole drug-exposed children as
low-achievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That `drug-addiction-during-pregnancy' label isn't going to
stick with you, and as you go along, you're going to get other
labels, like learning disabled and language delays,'' Lickert said.
</P>
<P>
   Many drug-affected children take mood-altering prescription
drugs like Ritalin, Sanders said. ``We're making the kids into drug
users because of the mothers' poly drug use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the answer? ``Accessibility to drug treatment,'' said
Andrea Borchers, an early intervention specialist with Starting
Point. ``There's just not enough. Instead of being put in jail,
(addicts) need to be in treatment.''

 &HT;    Nova House provides healing, helping shelter from crack abuse
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When her eighth child was born Nov. 5, Tara Hall
named the baby girl Serenity, after the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's a prayer that's repeated often at Nova House in Dayton,
where Hall, 30, has been getting in-patient treatment for crack
cocaine and alcohol addiction for the past couple of months. She
graduates from the treatment program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the treatment, Serenity was born drug free _ unlike
the last six of her brothers and sisters. Serenity was premature at
32 weeks and four pounds, four ounces, but the prematurity couldn't
be blamed on Hall's drug use this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just wanted her to come, I guess,'' Hall said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said she started using drugs in 1987, the year after her
first child was born. She said she voluntarily entered the Nova
House program for women after she was released from jail, where
she'd served time for a drug offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be out there in that madness and use (drugs),
so I decided to come to Nova,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug rehabilitation experts say pregnancy can be a window of
opportunity for women to defeat drug habits. ``Even addicted moms
and dads want to see the best for their children,'' said Diane
Patterson, director of Miami Valley Hospital's Born Free treatment
program for pregnant addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I was pregnant, it was kind of like
salvation,'' said Yvette, 31, a graduate of Born Free who asked
that her last name be withheld. Now sober for three years, she has
two healthy children, ages one and two, she's finishing work toward
a bachelor's degree and is working as a counselor for Born Free,
helping other addicts to get off drugs. ``Me staying sober when I
was pregnant was easy, because I wanted my baby,'' Yvette said. But
``it's not everybody's time (to quit drugs), and we've lost women
to the drugs and we've lost babies.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, pregnancy is the powerful motivator they need to give
up drugs permanently, though many others drop out of treatment or
stay clean only during pregnancy then promptly relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson recalled one Born Free client who has had three
crack-exposed babies. ``She comes this close to following through
(with treatment),'' Patterson said, holding her thumb and
forefinger a fraction of an inch apart, ``and then stops. One woman
had eight kids _ every one of them born with drugs on board and
every one born without prenatal care, a far greater issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who dropped out of high school as a sophomore, had been
through Nova House before, four years ago when her daughter Ishanae
was a crack-exposed, premature newborn. She said she stayed clean
for five months after that treatment, then went back to drugs.
She's had two more drug-exposed children since then, ages one and
two. But she insists she's now ready to stay straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I'm willing (to get treatment) for myself,'' she said.
``Back then, I just did it for Children Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a drug and alcohol family,'' Hall said. ``That's
all I've seen so that's all I thought life was about _ doing
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, many young addicts are themselves the children of
addicts, experts say. ``You're working on another generation that
are drug addicted, not graduating from high school, below poverty
level, getting sexually transmitted diseases,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem incomprehensible that a woman would intentionally
expose her unborn child to drugs and alcohol, but ``you don't have
pregnant women using drugs, you have women who use drugs finding
themselves pregnant,'' said Kate Williams Palmer, coordinator of
women's programs for the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug
Addiction Services. ``They're addicts who get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't excuse substance abuse by pregnant women, Patterson
said. ``It's violent to use drugs and alcohol when you're
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs like the outpatient Born Free and the in-patient Nova
House use counseling, education and group therapy to help addicts
kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Born Free was started at Miami Valley Hospital in 1990. It has a
high dropout rate, but those who stick with the program almost
always have drug-free babies, Patterson said. About 80 women per
year attend the program, but only about 30 of them remain in the
program through delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1973, Nova House at 732 Beckman St. near the 10
Wilmington Place retirement center has had a special women's
inpatient unit since 1993. To date, 37 babies have been born
drug-free to program participants. Women live at Nova House for
three to six months, and their children can stay there with them.
The program gives top priority to intravenous drug users and women
who are pregnant or have children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nova House and Born Free have clients who come voluntarily,
and others who are referred by the courts. The treatment goes
beyond drug counseling to include parenting and life-skills
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a treatment plan that just says `you will stop
using drugs,' because that's only a part of it,'' said Janet
Housenick, director of the Nova House women's program. ``It's got
to be a lifestyle change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not only addicted to the dope, you're addicted to the
lifestyle and the people,'' Yvette said. ``You've got to tone it
down, you've got to change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yvette graduated from Born Free, she completely
refurnished her house to give herself a fresh start. She even had
her counselors come over and pray for the house. She sometimes
looks out her window and sees a dilapidated house next door that
reminds her of her own house during her drug days. It's a reminder
of how far she's come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold drugs out of my house,'' she said. ``And I had to go
back to that house _ I've made it a home.''
</P>
<P>
   One graduate of the Nova House program is a 43-year-old woman
named Ann, who agreed to be photographed but withheld her last name
because she doesn't want her children to be stigmatized by her drug
abuse. She said her most recent stint in Nova House, from February
to July, helped her develop a routine and a sense of order in what
had been a chaotic life.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of four, Ann grew up in southern California and began
using drugs at age 16, eventually becoming addicted to heroin,
crack and powdered cocaine. In 1985, she took the ``geographical
cure,'' moving to the Dayton area, where her father owned a
business, to get away from her drug connections. But ``I found what
I needed in Dayton, drug-wise. You can't run from it _ it's
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a ``very successful'' 22-year-old daughter in college
and a 15-year-old son who has been in treatment for drug problems
and theft. She didn't use drugs during her pregnancies with those
children, but both later were subjected to her erratic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very inconsistent,'' Ann admitted. ``So inconsistent
that I'd tell my mother I'd be right back and I'd come back two
days later,'' leaving the children with her mother, who finally
took custody of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Ann used drugs when she was pregnant with her 8-year-old
daughter _ and even spent some time in jail while pregnant. The
baby was born healthy, and Ann went back to drugs, slipping into
her bathroom to shoot up heroin or hit the crack pipe while her
baby played in another room.
</P>
<P>
   She was treated at Nova House in 1996 and got pregnant again
shortly after she finished treatment. She relapsed during her
pregnancy. That baby, a daughter, was born healthy in September
1997, but guilt about her drug use and its effects on her family
prompted Ann to return to Nova House in February. She said she's
been drug-free since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day's not a piece of cake, but I got a lot of tools
here,'' she said. ``Some days I don't even like me, but I'm not
getting high over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Hall said treatment has helped her see the impact her drug
lifestyle was having on her children. ``My 4-year-old is a real
angry child because I wasn't there for her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation from Nova House, Hall plans to move into a house
with her fiancee and the five children in her custody, some of whom
are staying with a relative. She lost custody of three of her
children _ two are with their father and a third was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Hall thinks this time she's ready to put drugs out of her life
for good. ``I need to stay away from the old people, places and
things,'' she said. ``It's going to be hard, but I think I am.''

 &HT;    Cigarettes, alcohol cause `merciless' damage to unborn babies
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The abuse of illicit drugs like crack cocaine by
pregnant women has received more attention, but experts say the
common, legal drugs _ alcohol and nicotine _ present some of the
greatest dangers to unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our legal substances that are killing us,'' said Harvey
Siegal, director of substance abuse treatment programs at Wright
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking by pregnant women can cause permanent brain damage and
other birth defects, including major organ malformations, in their
babies. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of mental
retardation, and the only preventable cause. Estimates of
occurrence vary widely _ the March of Dimes says 0.33 per 1,000
live births is a conservative estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Even children who don't have full-blown fetal alcohol syndrome
can have neurological deficits _ small head size, brain
abnormalities resulting in learning and behavior problems, hearing
loss and poor motor skills _ due to their mothers' drinking.
</P>
<P>
   While crack-exposed infants often outgrow their health problems,
``with the alcohol, it's just merciless,'' said Jean Sanders,
health services manager for Montgomery County Children Services.
``They never improve.''
</P>
<P>
   No safe amount of drinking while pregnant or nursing has been
established, according to the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug
Addiction Services, although the chances of ill effects increases
with the amount, frequency and duration of a woman's drinking. Some
of the most debilitating effects can happen early in pregnancy when
the baby's brain and other vital organs are developing _ and often
before the mother even knows she's pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes parents don't know that a beer with your pizza (when
you're pregnant) is substance abuse,'' said Denise Rinehart of
Starting Point, Montgomery County's intake unit for children with
developmental problems. Rinehart acknowledged that when she was
pregnant with her first child, ``I cut down to five cigarettes a
day. Now I know that none would've been better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest substance abuse we have to deal with is not crack,
it's not cocaine, it's not alcohol _ it's smoking,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey King, medical director for Born Free, Miami Valley
Hospital's program for pregnant substance abusers. ``I'll deal with
the crack and the alcohol if we could get people to stop smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette smoking by pregnant women can cause spontaneous
abortion, prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome, and asthma and
other respiratory problems for babies, King noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see younger and younger girls smoking and smoking
regularly,'' he said. ``Many smoke through pregnancy after
pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1992 National Pregnancy and Health Survey, 20.4
percent of pregnant women smoked sometime during their pregnancy.
Pregnant white women had the highest smoking rate at 24.4 percent,
compared with 19.8 percent for black women and 5.8 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   National studies have blamed smoking by pregnant women for
141,000 spontaneous abortions, 61,000 low-birth-weight deliveries,
1,200-2,200 sudden infant deaths and 4,800 perinatal deaths every
year.
</P>
<P>
   King believes many pregnant women don't realize the dangers of
smoking and drinking, despite all the publicity about them. One
study found that teens knew about fetal alcohol syndrome, but
erroneously believed it is treatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they know about it (the danger of drinking and
smoking),'' King said, ``but they don't know enough about it.''

 &HT;    Scary predictions of crack's lost generation haven't come to
pass
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Deon's biological mother used crack cocaine and
alcohol during her pregnancy _ and he has been paying a price ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   He came into this world weighing less than 2 pounds. He had mild
cerebral palsy. Bleeding on his brain. Tremors of the limbs and
jaw. Reflux so severe he'd stop breathing when he ate. Recurrent
kidney and bladder infections because his right ureter backed up.
Lungs so underdeveloped he had to be on oxygen for the first eight
months of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Just as disturbing, Deon seemed strangely disconnected from the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would just lay in his bassinet and stare,'' said his foster
mother, Brenda Singer of New Lebanon. ``You'd hold him and sing to
him and he'd just look you in the face. We didn't think anybody was
`home' for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 16 months old, Deon is outgrowing many of his health
problems, while other problems remain and a few new ones have
cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say for sure how much his early exposure to drugs and
alcohol may cloud his future.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after ``crack babies'' first made headlines locally,
experts are learning more about infants like Deon. The good news:
The horrifying early predictions of a brain-damaged lost generation
haven't come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Where some experts once feared legions of drug-injured children
would require lifelong institutionalization, recent studies show
crack babies don't show any consistent patterns of birth defects
and eventually catch up developmentally with drug-free children of
low-income mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean it's OK to use drugs when you're pregnant,
experts stress.
</P>
<P>
   As Deon's story illustrates, crack-exposed babies often are born
prematurely with attendant ailments that are traumatic for them and
costly for society.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers are picking up the tab for Deon's ongoing medical
care, including $176,289 for the 105 days he spent in intensive
care as a newborn. His foster mother estimates his medical costs so
far at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Deon's hospital bills are at the high end for drug-exposed
babies, but the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction
Services estimates each crack baby costs taxpayers an average of
$46,000.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the effects of cocaine on a fetus are more subtle
than once thought, some experts are concerned that crack babies'
emotional detachment, hyperactivity and impulsiveness may persist
into adulthood. Others say it's impossible to single out crack
exposure as the cause of behavior and learning problems in children
who often grow up in chaotic homes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue is this this: Crack babies are rarely
exposed only to crack. Their mothers often also expose them to
other street drugs, nicotine and alcohol, which may be the most
devastating drug of them all. Pregnant addicts also often are
poorly nourished and don't get prenatal care. If they trade sex for
drugs, they're at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're looking at is a whole constellation of factors,''
said Harvey Siegal, director of Wright State University's substance
abuse programs. ``The jury is really still out. Whether we can
really attribute all these horrible neurological deficits to the
cocaine, nobody's quite sure.''
</P>
<P>
   While the use of cocaine overall has declined sharply since its
peak in 1985, use of crack hasn't changed significantly in recent
years, studies show. Use of all illicit drugs in the U.S. peaked in
1979. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug, but,
according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the highly
addictive ``crack cocaine continues to dominate the nation's
illicit drug problem.'' Use has remained steady in recent years
with an estimated 1.75 million users nationwide, the institute
reported, although it appears fewer youths are taking up the habit
and most users are older, inner-city addicts. Many of those
addicts, however, are still in their childbearing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it certainly has remained at least steady,'' said
Lt. James Finnigan, commander of the Dayton police narcotics
bureau. ``I haven't seen any decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton police make 900-1,100 arrests a year for drug felonies,
mostly involving crack, he said. Women make up 20-25 percent of the
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, all the local hospitals tested the urine in
diapers of every newborn baby for a month and found almost 3
percent had cocaine metabolites, meaning the mother used cocaine
within two weeks of delivery, said Lorrie Ellis of Miami Valley
Hospital. From that figure, officials estimated that about 11
percent of all babies had been exposed to cocaine at some time
during gestation. If those estimates hold true today, as many as
850 babies born in Montgomery County in a year's time have been
exposed to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that when a pregnant woman uses cocaine, the
drug may cross over the placenta and directly interfere with the
fetus's development, or it may indirectly affect the fetus by
reducing blood flow to the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies have confirmed that cocaine use may cause serious
damage but also that many infants are surprisingly resilient and
may overcome initial signs of physical or cognitive impairment,''
Dr. Jeffrey King, medical director of Born Free, Miami Valley
Hospital's treatment program for pregnant substance abusers, wrote
in the September 1997 issue of the journal Postgraduate Medicine .
</P>
<P>
   Because addicts often don't report their drug use and doctors
rarely test for drugs, substance abuse by pregnant women is ``one
of the most frequently missed diagnoses in obstetrics,'' King said.
``There's a conspiracy of silence.''
</P>
<P>
   While reliable statistics are elusive, King said studies
indicate at least 20 percent of pregnant women expose their unborn
children to the dangerous legal drugs of alcohol and nicotine, and
at least 10 percent expose them to illegal drugs. King is convinced
many women don't realize what harm they could be causing.
</P>
<P>
   Deon's foster parents, Jay and Brenda Singer, have opened their
home to 18 children _ most of them drug-exposed babies _ in the
past three years. Some have shown no signs of impairment. Others
have displayed a host of problems. ``Taking the drugs is pretty
much Russian roulette,'' Jay Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little girl with irritable bowel syndrome. ``She was
up every two hours in the night,'' Brenda Singer said. ``She'd just
scream at the top of her lungs.'' There was a Jekyll-and-Hyde
5-year-old boy, her husband recalled, who ``had a monster inside
him.'' There was a 14-year-old girl whose heroin addict mother had
sold her into prostitution to get drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had children who were born in crack houses, not in the
hospital, and the mother was using crack to bear the pain of
labor,'' Jay Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a couple of the moms,'' Brenda said. ``They
thought if they used enough drugs, the baby would abort.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of the mothers of infants are themselves the
children of drug addicts. In addition to Deon, the Singers are
fostering 15-month-old, mentally retarded twins. The twins were not
drug-affected babies, but they were born to a learning-disabled
teen-ager whose mother is an addict. The twins' mother is herself
in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the Singers' foster children eventually have been
placed in the custody of their natural grandmothers. Brenda worries
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting at times, because I get so attached to them and
they leave and we never see them again,'' said the Singers' natural
daughter, Laura, 12. The couple, who are both 34 and have been
together since they were 15, also have a 15-year-old son, Derek.
</P>
<P>
   The Singers _ he's a welder, she's a full-time homemaker with
nurse's training _ want to adopt Deon if Montgomery County Children
Services succeeds in getting permanent custody in court next month.
But Children Services officials have told them they'll have an
uphill struggle to adopt him since race is a factor in adoptions _
the Singers are white and Deon is black.
</P>
<P>
   Deon was born with crack in his system on June 23, 1997, and
remained in the hospital until Oct. 6, 1997, when he went home with
the Singers. They've had him ever since. His birth mother, a woman
in her mid-20s, has had two brief visits with him in the last year.
She has three other children, who live with their grandmother, but
the grandmother was unable to care for a fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   Deon mostly laid and stared until February, when he finally
began to interact with the family. The once-passive baby is now
hyperactive with a short attention span, but Brenda Singer said he
is quite intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   He has outgrown most of his breathing and urinary problems. But
he is classified as having a ``failure to thrive,'' common in crack
babies. He is underweight _ ``almost anorexic,'' Brenda said _
doesn't cry when he's hungry and resists feeding. The Singers mix
his food with melted butter and a high-calorie additive in a bid to
get his weight up to normal.
</P>
<P>
   But Deon is now on target with his age group in motor-skills
development. ``He's come a long way,'' Brenda Singer said.
``Getting intervention and a lot of attention has done him a lot of
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singers often ponder why pregnant women continue to abuse
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about that all the time,'' Jay Singer said. ``How can
anybody do this to a child, born or unborn?

   NOTE TO EDS ABOUT CLINTON ASIA TRIP: President Clinton has
delayed his trip to Asia to attend the APEC summit meeting in
Malaysia. Vice President Al Gore will go instead. The itinerary
calls for Japan and South Korea. Here is a budget of the advance
package of stories, all of which have moved in both the
International and Commentary categories:
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-SUMMIT _ KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Shellshocked after more
than a year of Asian economic crisis, many Asians are in a sour
mood as they await this week's visit by President Clinton. Seldom
since the Cold War has a world leader been more publicly
vituperative toward Western financial institutions than the
Malaysian prime minister, who will host Clinton and 20 other Asian
and Pacific leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in his recession-wracked capital Nov. 17-18. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox
News Service).
</P>

</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECONOMY _ TOKYO _ The personnel director of a major
Japanese construction company started on his fourth
whiskey-on-the-rocks as he explained his own gloomy role in the
recession that stubbornly blocks Japan's economic engine from
igniting. ``My mission is to do the firing. If I don't do it, I
will be fired,'' said Tomihei Soudou, who was unwinding after a
recent Saturday of work with three colleagues at a shopping complex
restaurant. In 18 years he has fired ``not even 10 people'' at the
company with a payroll of 15,000 workers. In the next three years,
he must get rid of 1,000. Fear over who next will be squeezed out
of Japan's weakened industries, fall victim to the highest surge of
bankruptcies since World War II, or see wages or annual bonuses
trimmed further back is a key reason for the persisting recession.

<P>
   CHINA-ECONOMY _ BEIJING _ The stalls at the ``Russian market''
are bulging with bright down jackets, fur coats, ski pants, wool
sweaters, hats, muffs and gloves to warm up winter in the Russian
icebox. The only thing lacking are Russian buyers. The sales slump
in the warren of stores and open-air stalls densely packing this
market is one symptom of how the Asian economic contagion has
spread. And it raises questions of whether China still may catch
the malaise. Russia's wide-ranging economic problems produced a
meltdown in August _ the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a
moratorium on foreign credit repayments. In an economic atmosphere
already burdened by the Asian crisis, the International Monetary
Fund and big industrial countries let it happen. And jittery
foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but to get out
of emerging markets around the world. Russia's fall has landed one
more punch to China's economy, which already had been weakened by
the woes besetting its Asian neighbors. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-ECONOMY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Koreans groping through the
deep waters of economic collapse have divided recent history into
two eras _ before and after the International Monetary Fund. Store
placards announce IMF going-out-of business sales. Computer
software ads in subway trains cite the IMF bogeyman, warning
readers to learn new skills or risk losing their jobs. And Koreans
refer often to the good days past, compared to the diminishing,
daily life changes the IMF wrought with financial and monetary
controls imposed in a $58.35 billion bail-out package last year.
Koreans give the IMF a mixed review, welcoming some reforms the
agency spurred in this nation's economy, at the same time they cite
Korea as an example of the IMF gone wrong. A one-time ``Asian
tiger,'' Korea has been sorely wounded. (Kunstel, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ECONOMY _ KIARA PAYUNG, Indonesia _ In once-prosperous
villages like this one, hundreds of thousands of children are
dropping out of school and going hungry as the Asian economic
collapse brings real poverty back to the Indonesian countryside.
``I don't go to school any more,'' says Supendi, a 13-year-old boy.
``The school fee is 3,000 rupiahs (40 cents) a month, and my mother
doesn't have enough money to pay it.'' So Supendi lounges away the
muggy midday heat by crouching on a tin-roofed porch and listening
to the young men of Kiara Payung talk about ``the old days'' just
one year ago. It's only been a year since this fast-growing,
seemingly stable nation of 210 million people was dragged down by
the riptide of the Asian economic crisis. (Albright, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-QUOTES _ The Faces of the Asian Economic Crisis. These
quotes, each accompanied by head shots, will move as a quote box,
but can be dropped in as individual illustrations to match the
package of stories. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-DATA _ The vital statistics on the 20 APEC countries.
(Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASIA _ WASHINGTON _ When the world picks up the phone
and dials 911 these days, it's increasingly the president of the
United States who answers the call. In an extraordinary year of
crisis management, President Clinton has helped to broker
agreements aimed at ending bloodshed in Northern Ireland, Kosovo
and the Middle East. He's struggled, with mixed results, to bring
to heel weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq and Iran,
worked to hold together a plan that keeps in check North Korea's
nuclear ambitions and urged India and Pakistan to step back from
perilous nuclear saber-rattling and instead commit to a global arms
control regime. In the days ahead, he'll be focused on trying to
arrest a virulent strain of global economic contagion that has
already decimated half a dozen Asian economies, threatens much of
the emerging world and poses enormous risks to growth and wealth in
the United States. ''This is the nature of things in the world
today,'' Clinton said recently. ''Not everything we have to do is
easy.'' (Deans, Cox News Service).

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Gary M.
Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine to
Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529, a small propeller-driven plane that crashed in a
hayfield in West Georgia killing 10 of the 29 people aboard. In a
seven-part series beginning Sunday, Pomerantz vividly describes the
9 minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard the doomed aircraft and
how the tragedy has reshaped lives. WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS

   CRASH-THEFALL _ ASA Flight 529 was more than three miles high
when a propeller blade broke off its left wing. The twin-engine
Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane carrying 29 people shuddered and
fell. In window seat 2-A, a young woman who had served in the Army
thought she'd heard a small cannon explode. She looked out and saw
the propeller declare war on the left wing. She slammed shut her
window shade, frightened by the sight and what it meant. Flight
attendant Robin Fech grabbed the metal kitchen galley where the
passengers' drinks were stored to steady herself. Soda cans
trembled. Under her breath, Fech cursed. Of the 29 people aboard,
19 would live to tell about it. In the telling, survivors almost
without exception have asked themselves the same question about
those nine minutes and 20 seconds: Was it really that long?

   OHIO-CRACK-KIDS _ Ten years after ``crack babies'' first made

lifelong institutionalization, recent studies show crack babies
don't show any consistent patterns of birth defects and eventually

Hence, the name Lucky. Friedman gave it to a considerate friend in
Utopia who would later accept more of his rescued animals, mostly
dogs. It was the start of one of his dreams - to start an animal
rescue group. Thus the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch was born. The

Smith and others who serve on an advisory board. The rescue ranch

   SIXTH _ Whenever the election date is set, national attention
will focus on northside Atlanta's 6th District. Not because of the
election so much but because it is the seat being vacated by the
former House speaker. What are the national cameras likely to see
in this district that in many ways represents the Atlanta of the
New South? While still predominately white, the district, which
spans four counties, includes a growing number of middle-class

describing the transient nature of the town and how it is wrestling

   EDISON _ It's hard to find anyone in an Edison school who
doesn't like it. Despite a rocky start in a few school systems and
only slight improvement in test scores, ``Edisonized'' parents,
teachers, and students seem overwhelmingly happy with the education
management company. Reporters in Michigan, Washington, D.C., and
Miami found children and teachers enthusiastic about the
curriculum, the computers, even the longer school day. Teachers say
they feel more free to design their own programs and enjoy the
ability to e-mail parents on the families' Edison-issued computers.
Parents are on a waiting list for the Miami school. The Atlanta
Public Schools system is in contract negotiations with the
education management company to take over possibly three Atlanta
elementary schools, but has also put out requests for proposals to
other education management companies, delaying what was initially
expected to be a December vote on Edison. (Carter, Atlanta

   MONEY _ How can Edison do what it promises? That is, to take the
same per-pupil tax dollars a system normally receives for its
students and provide every teacher with a classroom telephone,
every family with a home computer, every school with $1.5 million
in improvements, and make a profit, too? Edison says it's doing it,
with the school systems' tax dollars and its own resources from
investors. The company is now preparing to sell stock to teachers
and plans to take its stock options public. One critic cautions
that Edison founder Chris Whittle saw his former company, Whittle
Communications, go bankrupt (checking on that), and says venture
capitalists like the ones investing in Edison may not stick around
for long. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45. MOVED

   MIAMI _ After a difficult first year and a smoother second year,
Miami's five-year contract with Edison seems to be hitting stride
at the mid-point. Test scores still lag the district and statewide
averages, but scores for most grades are moving up, a significant
achievement in a school filled with low-income and immigrant
children. (Williams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22. MOVED

RUTGERS' OPTIMISM FADES AS MOUNTAINEERS RALLY AND ROMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ The five victories that Rutgers brought into
Saturday's game against West Virginia helped erase the stigma of
last year's season without a victory. But as the Scarlet Knights
were driving toward the Mountaineers' end zone in the final minutes
of the third quarter, with a tie score just 13 yards away, the fans
at Rutgers Stadium were beginning to believe what only those in the
locker room had believed before.
</P>
<P>
   With representatives from the Liberty Bowl in attendance,
Rutgers had more than just the game on the line when sophomore
quarterback Mike McMahon dropped back to pass. But a misread of the
defense, the sort of error that comes with inexperience, led
McMahon to fire a ball to the goal line for Andy Holland with West
Virginia free safety Jerry Porter lurking nearby. And when Holland
headed toward the goalpost and McMahon threw it behind the slant,
Porter picked off the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The interception ended the threat, and when subsequent drives
ended with a sack and then a fumble, Rutgers was shaken back to
reality as West Virginia won, 28-14. Amos Zereoue pounded the ball
on the ground, finishing with 35 carries for 228 yards rushing for
3,801 career rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   While West Virginia's players and coaches spoke afterward of
sub-par efforts, Rutgers (5-5) was left with the sad realization
that for all of the improvement, the season would likely end
without a Bowl bid. The Scarlet Knights will finish the season next
week at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved we can compete,'' said Pete Donnelly, a senior
offensive lineman. ``I hate that that is where we're at. But we
proved that we're scrappers, that we fight. Some people need a bowl
ring to be happy. But I'm proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no point did I believe we weren't going to win. I didn't
look at the rankings. One thing we've focused on is improving to be
able to compete in these type of games. I think we're on the verge
of being able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers lost to a team that has spent much of the season in the
Top 25. And Zereoue's 228 yards were the most by any player at the
new Rutgers Stadium and the most against the Scarlet Knights since
1990 when Michigan State's Tico Duckett ran for 229.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rutgers played their hearts out,'' said Zereoue, a Long Island
native. ``This game could have made their season very successful.
It was an ugly win, but we'll take an ugly win over a loss any
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers Coach Terry Shea said: ``We played a team that at this
point in our growth is at a different level. We knew it coming in.
But I'm proud of our effort. Maybe we're not mature enough to beat
them, but that's the level we're going to build to.''
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia jumped out to a 14-0 first-quarter lead,
navigating the field with ease as quarterback Marc Bulger completed
5-of-5 passes and fullback Anthony Green bulled in from 1 yard out
on the opening drive. Bulger connected with Shawn Foreman on a
20-yard touchdown pass on the second drive of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers closed the gap to 14-7 with a 10-yard touchdown pass
from McMahon to Jermaine Robinson with 6 minutes 44 seconds to play
in the first half. West Virginia answered right back with a
seven-play, 68-yard drive as Zereoue burst through from 8 yards out
for a 21-7 advantage. Then Rutgers was driving in Mountaineer
territory when McMahon was picked off by Gary Thompkins in the
final minute of the half.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Rutgers scored on the first play from
scrimmage, with McMahon finding Tosh Riddick on a short hitch along
the left sideline. Riddick turned the 8-yard pass into a 65-yard
run as he dodged a tackle by linebacker Chris Edmonds and outran
three West Virginia defenders to the end zone to pull within 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers then drove from their own 48-yard line to the West
Virginia 13, with McMahon connecting on passes of 14 and 15 yards
on third-down conversions. But he then misfired with the
interception and West Virginia was able to put the game out of
reach thanks to a 46-yard run by Zereoue that set up a 6-yard
scoring pass from Bulger to Anthony Becht.

COWBOYS COULD ENJOY PRIME TIME IN SAGGING NFC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the current state of the Cowboys combined with the current
state of the NFC East, why be picky about a ``Big Game''?
</P>
<P>
   Finding one anywhere in the division is next to impossible.
Finding one in Tempe, Ariz. is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all we've got. Cherish the moment today as the Cowboys
hook it up with their lone divisional challenger, the
not-real-good-but-still-5-and-4 Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It is a statistical fact that the Cardinals don't run the ball
well, and neither do they stop the run. Teams that have beaten
Dallas this season have done both.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a popular notion around the league, and also
locally, that this will be a game where the Cowboys take a fall.
But the only way that happens is if an old reflex kicks in, meaning
the Cardinals aren't taken seriously. That's the way it's been for
a long and Dallas usually wins anyway. But it can't work that way
today.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, incentive should be no problem for the Cowboys, and
that goes deeper than a virtual lock-down of the divisional title
with a victory over the Cardinals. Bigger fish are waiting to be
hooked. It's no longer just about the least from the East.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the entire NFC is looking rather shabby.
Once-mighty has been reduced to very-iffy. More and more, the
conference is showing signs of being wide open. Come early January,
the most-ready-for-the-playoffs NFC team could well be the one that
has health and homefield on it's side.
</P>
<P>
   Call it crawfishing on my part (based on preseason
expectations), but the Cowboys are moving ever closer to being a
prime NFC title contender. Reality says it may be more a case of
the NFC's top clubs having taken a southward plunge, but somebody
eventually has to win the conference and then be whiplashed by
Denver in the Super Bowl. It might well be Dallas ... maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone else also revising the NFC race, we're at least
in good company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my thinking on the Cowboys,'' said Fox TV's Pat
Summerall on Friday. ``I've moved them up to contender status in
the conference, and I'm also putting Atlanta in there. There is no
team in the NFC that currently stands out. I see holes in the top
clubs, and some of them with serious holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and swiftest decline, of course, has been in Green
Bay. After two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, the Pack is
suddenly not up to cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Bay has no running game, the offensive line is passive
and I never thought I'd describe Favre \RBrett\S as an uncertain
quarterback, but that's the way he looks,'' said Summerall, who
then went to the Packers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lacking in speed _ in fact, just flat slow,'' he added.
``Gilbert Brown is giving them nothing in the middle of the line,
and really, there's no defensive playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay plays against the Giants today in New Jersey, and
while that might be a gimme, it kicks off a three-game road swing,
with stops also in Pittsburgh and Minnesota. At 6-3, the Packers'
season could be determined before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has the best conference record, but health at
quarterback is a new question, while overall defensive strength
remains a nagging question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the Vikings) are very good on defense,'' said
Summerall, ``and that can and will catch up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's San Francisco, the last of the so-called Big Three
in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Young is so good, but there's no offensive line, and
they are very lightweight in the defensive line,'' said Summerall.
``I wouldn't be surprised at all if Atlanta beats them (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jerry Jones is also assessing the NFC these days
while trying to determine how the Cowboys compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get ahead of myself, and all I've said from
the start is I feel we can develop enough to be a contender,'' said
Jones. ``I think we will all know more on Monday, but I do like our
chances at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jones is banking on is a Dallas offense that has yet to
blossom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we improve offensively like Chan (Gailey) thinks we are
going to improve, then it takes us to another level,'' said Jones.
``If you look at the upside on every team in the NFC, then we might
have an advantage simply because Troy (Aikman) is just getting back
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens against Arizona is the immediate concern,
although it is not unreasonable to also be considering homefield
implications in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the ``Big Game'' question for today. The
answer is yes. This is one.

REAL ESTATE: LONG-AWAITED MEGAMALL RISES IN ELIZABETH, N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 1.3-million-square-foot mall now rising on a former
landfill in Elizabeth, N.J., is completed next October, it will be
the first in New Jersey to combine manufacturers' outlet stores and
large discount retailers, as well as traditional large mall stores,
with entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Set in an old industrial section of this Union County city, what
is officially called the Jersey Gardens Value Megamall will also
become the state's eighth-largest shopping center and, its
developers as well as city officials hope, a tourist attraction. It
is to include more than 100 outlet stores, 33 large traditional
mall stores, a 10,000-square-foot food court in a two-story
building and parking space for 5,528 cars off Exit 13A of the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the entertainment portion has signed on six restaurants
and Jeepers, a 25,000-square-foot family recreation center,
including rides for children 12 and younger. And Loews Cineplex
Entertainment, created in May by the merger of Sony/Loews Theaters
and Cineplex Odeon Corp., will open its newest theater format, a
108,000-square-foot, 22-screen theater with 5,000 seats plus a
lounge area and special reserved seats for those paying a premium
on their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be an as-yet undetermined sports component where
some retailers will offer ``reality-based shopping,'' which means
customers will be able to test out their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Road and traffic improvements, from ramps to an elevated
roadway, are now under way to connect the 130-acre development site
to the Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The developer is Glimcher Realty Trust of Columbus, Ohio, a real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that secured its financing before
Wall Street's recent travails. Michael Ovitz, former president of
Walt Disney Co. and, before that, head of Creative Artists Agency,
is involved in the mall's entertainment component.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are offering is an experience,'' said Michael
Glimcher, senior vice president of development and leasing at the
company, noting that nearly 65 percent of the space at the mall had
been preleased.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Jeepers and Loews, other tenants that have signed on for
space at the mall include: Annie Sez, a discount women's clothing
store; Record Town SuperStore, Oshman's SuperSports USA, Bed Bath &AMP;
Beyond, Off Fifth-Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet, Jewelers on Fifth and
Mikasa, a tableware store. Rents, including common area maintenance
charges, range from $20 to $165 a square foot and average $55.
Leases run from five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Financing includes $140 million in tax-exempt bonds and grants
from the semi-autonomous New Jersey Economic Development Authority,
most of it for the road improvements, as well as a $163 million
loan from Bankers Trust and Huntington National Bank. Glimcher is
also investing $56 million of its own equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall has been talked about for years; now it is a reality,
creating a sense of excitement about the opportunity for jobs and
additional economic development it will create,'' said J. Christian
Bollwage, mayor of Elizabeth. ``In the '80s other cities around us
developed. Now, it's our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the mall has stirred early discussions about a possible
arena for the New Jersey Metro Stars soccer team on a portion of a
200-acre undeveloped tract adjacent to the mall. The arena, he
said, could help the area to become a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates by the city are that when the mall is complete it will
generate 5,200 permanent jobs, as well as $4 million to $5 million
in annual tax revenues. The city, Bollwage added, will also receive
a similar amount from a tax on retailers of 3 percent of gross
sales and ``hard goods,'' such as appliances, electronics and
furniture _ permitted under a 1996 state law specifically targeting
Elizabeth _ that can be levied on tenants in the mall, which sits
within a state Urban Enterprise Zone. In such a zone businesses are
offered tax breaks and retailers can charge a 3 percent sales tax
instead of the normal 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of building a mall on the former landfill, which closed
in 1972, dates to 1995. But preparing the site for development was
started three years earlier by OENJ Corp. of Elizabeth, a land
developer specializing in difficult sites.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997 Glimcher bought 126 acres of the site from OENJ,
which still owns 40 acres along Newark Bay that it will develop.
The company would not disclose the price.
</P>
<P>
   Location was a key reason the company got involved in the
Elizabeth project, said Glimcher. He noted that the site offered
``access to all of New Jersey as well as to Manhattan'' and
represented ``an opportunity in an untapped market.''

   Some 180,000 cars pass the site daily and 15.2 million people
with an average household income of $61,000 live within a 40-mile
radius of it. Newark International Airport is five minutes away and
just to the north sits an IKEA furnishings store, which was
recently expanded by 80,000 square feet to 268,324 feet and
attracts more than 2 million shoppers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors along with the appeal of the 3 percent sales tax
and the mall's hybrid nature will serve it well, despite the stock
market's recent mood swings and signs of tempered consumer
confidence, its developers said and many retail brokers agree.
``Consumers are cautious but they are not paranoid,'' said Ted
Kraus, who heads TKO Real Estate Advisory Group, a retail
consulting firm in Mercerville.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties in the world's financial markets, he added,
have not severely affected the retail market in New Jersey, where
the statewide vacancy rate is under 3 percent and rents remain
stable at $15 to $41 a square foot on average, up from $12 to $35 a
square foot annually last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a downturn in the economy and consumer spending
slows, traditional retailers will be more affected than
discounters, who may be more in demand by shoppers looking for
value,'' said Richard Kalvoda, manager at the Ridgewood office of
the real estate advisory group for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Schultz, president of Schultz Organization, a
commercial brokerage in Woodbridge, added: ``The expansion of the
discount speciality chains, or category killers, which has started
to put supply in front of demand, will accelerate and at that
point, only the strong will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   While the location of the Elizabeth mall makes its retail
potential clear, brokers say the area's entertainment draw is
cloudy. ``When you think of entertainment, you don't think of that
area,'' said Kalvoda. Added Schultz: ``It may take time to catch
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers and Loews Cineplex are betting otherwise. ``It's
one of the few areas in the state that has a dense population and
no theaters,'' said Glimcher.
</P>
<P>
   To Loews Cineplex, ``it is an unbelievable location that with
the quality of the mall will have a regional draw,'' said Marc
Pascucci, vice president of advertising and publicity. He said the
Elizabeth theater reflected his company's newest design, and will
be first in the New York-New Jersey area. He likened what he called
the VIP lounge to skyboxes in sports stadiums. It will have its own
concession stand as well as an area where liquor and light snacks
will be sold. Patrons will pay a ticket premium of 25 to 30
percent, said Pascucci.
</P>
<P>
   Glimcher said his company will offer van service to and from
Newark Airport to draw travelers on long stopovers. It is also
negotiating with a ferry operator to run a service from a location
on the property along Newark Bay to and from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The movie theater and the mall are being designed by David
Rockwell of Manhattan, who has been involved in designing many
entertainment attractions, including the Academy Awards Theater in
Hollywood and improvements to Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Gardens will have an ``earthy'' exterior finish of brown,
beige and green to reflect ``its name and create a green oasis in
an otherwise gray area,'' Glimcher said, adding that he expected
the mall, which began construction last April, to attract more than
20 million visitors a year.

-- Serena Robb, in her home looking at photographs of her younger
brother Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and
an abortion doctor by principle, who was killed last month by a
snipers bullet fired into his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Sleepian was a
man who refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he
should be, and for that, he paid with his life. ``He was an
incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up,
it's up, says H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece.

at the funeral of a 34-year-old Zambian man who died of what his
father described as ``fits.'' While the man's family paid for this
funeral, many Zambian companies pay funeral expenses for their
workers. As is frequently the case in Africa, employees often deny
they are sick, refuse HIV tests and try to work until they die.

are from tuberculosis, malaria and complaints like ``bad chest''

impact of the AIDS epidemic on companies in Africa is difficult,

 LUSAKA, Zambia: not Malawians.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Companies
</P>
<P>
   Some Cut Costs, Others Stress Help
</P>
<P>
   The third-greatest economic damage done by AIDS is to corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies will talk about AIDS in their work force and some
hide the problem even from their shareholders, so analyses of
losses are relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   At Indeni, Zambia's only oil refinery, AIDS costs doubled from
1991 to 1993 and surpassed the company's meager profits the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Botswana Diamond Valuing Co., whose 525 highly
trained sorters pick diamonds off conveyor belts full of mine
gravel, estimated that AIDS cost it $237 per employee, or 6 percent
of profits, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Botswana Meat Commission, which slaughters the country's
beef, its second-biggest export after diamonds, was losing $268 per
employee, or 8 percent of profits.
</P>
<P>
   At Muhoroni Sugar, a huge sugar plantation in Kenya, costs in
1994 were only $49 per employee, but they were expected to double
while the company kept losing money. (To keep this in perspective,
one must remember how low wages are in Africa. A typical Muhoroni
worker earned about $1,200 a year.)
</P>
<P>
   AIDS bleeds profits from companies in many ways: medical and
death expenses, funeral payments, the costs of recruiting and
training new employees; work hours lost because employees are off
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in companies that keep statistics, more
work-hours are lost to funeral attendance than to illness. Since
most Africans are buried in their rural home villages, attending a
relative's funeral means asking for up to a week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my tradition, I can have three or four mothers,'' said
Mulenga Kapwepwe, an executive at Project Concern, an
AIDS-monitoring group here, explaining that Africans consider
aunts, uncles and cousins to be immediate family. ``Before the
epidemic, things were loose _ I could go bury anyone in my extended
family. Now companies are tightening up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the potentially huge costs of accidents. ``I had a
guy collapse at the airport the other day,'' said an executive who
spoke on condition his company not be named. ``What if he'd been
driving his truck and hit a 727?''
</P>
<P>
   With brutally hard-nosed management, some companies can contain
costs. Although 20 to 25 of the 900 employees of Chilanga Cement
die each year, the effect on the bottom line is ``almost
negligible,'' said chief executive Patrick Gorman. The disease does
not even rate a mention in the annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The Lusaka-area company, which owns Zambia's biggest cement
plant, was sold by the government to Britain's Commonwealth
Development Corp. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its deaths are among laborers, who are easily replaced,
and the company is laying men off anyway, Gorman said. ``To put it
callously, it's achieving what we want,'' he said. ``Natural
wastage is letting us reach our manning levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Absenteeism for funerals had increased 15-fold between 1992 and
1995, but ``we've stamped on that,'' he added. A worker may leave
only for the funeral of a wife, parent or child without losing the
day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   White-collar deaths are ``surprisingly low,'' Gorman said,
though he had to hire back a marketing director because the two
successors he hired have both died.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's on-site clinic, costs are ``down to about $15
per head per annum,'' he said. ``We draw the line at AZT and all
these high-powered expensive drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   For each worker who died, the company used to pay for the
coffin, hearse, buses for mourners, food for the funeral meal and a
cash grant to the family. ``When I first got here, I tried to do
away with the whole thing and ended up in a three-month firefight
with the union,'' Gorman said. Ultimately, they settled for a grant
worth about $200.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum in Zambia is Barclay's Bank,
the country's biggest. Its employees are overwhelmingly
white-collar and high school or college graduates. With
subsidiaries across Africa, Barclay's is widely admired for its
AIDS plans, of which Zambia's was the first.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has never calculated exactly how much the disease costs
it, said Bright Nyirenda, who started the program. But its
startling wake-up call came in the late 1980s when it was legal to
give blood tests to job applicants: eight of the 10 interviewed in
the small city of Kabwe proved HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the company's ranks, ``young men ready for
promotion were dying,'' said Sylvester Mubengwa, Nyirenda's
successor as health and safety manager.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1992, the bank's annual mortality rate rose
from 0.4 percent to 2.23 percent. In the United States about 0.25
percent is typical. It has since leveled off a bit lower, with 85
percent of the deaths AIDS-related.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, many are middle managers. The typical
death comes after six years of service; the bank lost eight
supervisory or managerial rank employees last year and 11 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have been hard-hit are the secretaries to those men.
``The managers travel a lot, and so are ... exposed to
temptation,'' said Nyirenda, straining to speak delicately. ``Back
at work, they prevail over their juniors, and get favors from them.
With secretaries, it can turn out quite viciously.'' The bank has a
sexual-harassment policy, he said, but workers in impoverished
Zambia are desperate to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bank pays relatively well, it can fill its depleted
ranks by raiding other companies. Small firms cannot compete for
executive talent.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay's does not merely offer health lectures and free
condoms, as some companies do. ``It's bank policy to show
compassion,'' Mubengwa said, sitting under a poster of the
Barclay's eagle with a red AIDS ribbon on its wing.
</P>
<P>
   When an employee begins to show signs of sickness _ slackening
concentration, growing absenteeism _ Mubengwa tries to work out a
plan that eases the work burden, oversees medical care and suggests
disability retirement. Employees are prodded to prolong their lives
by living in healthy ways _ quitting smoking, taking vitamins,
avoiding new infections.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is frequently the case here, the employees often
deny they are sick, refuse HIV tests and try to work until they
die. In a legacy of mining-based economies, African companies
typically pay two to four times annual salary to the family of a
worker who dies on the job, while disability retirements are
pittances.

 LUSAKA, Zambia: are pittances.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Economies
</P>
<P>
   Loss So Far Slight, but Potential Fades
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly enough, the least catastrophic damage from
the epidemic is at the macroeconomic level. Most of the 610 million
people in Africa south of the Sahara are subsistence farmers,
herders or fishermen. Those with formal jobs are usually laborers,
crop pickers or miners. Although they suffer and die, the economy
marches on indifferently. There are so many desperate job-seekers
that they are quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Mead Over, a World Bank economist, estimates that in Africa's 10
worst-hit countries, through the year 2025, the disease will reduce
growth of gross domestic product per capita by only 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although total GDP goes down when the sick do not grow crops or
produce goods, he explained, so many people die that those who are
left own greater slices of the economic pie. And he is quick to
point out that an 0.3 percent drop in growth is significant in
countries struggling to grow even 1 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists almost apologetically compare AIDS in Africa to
the 14th century's Black Death. That great scythe of bubonic plague
killed nearly a third of Europe's people in three years, but from a
cold-bloodedly financial point of view, the survivors did nicely.
With labor scarce, wages climbed, and ``a lot of people suddenly
had a lot more land,'' Over said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Alan Whiteside, an economist at the University of Natal,
in South Africa, noted, many African economies are shrinking, while
governments are selling state enterprises and trimming public
payrolls. ``Being cynical about it,'' he said, ``They think, `If
you're going to lose people anyway, do you mind how they go?'''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of deaths in the civil service has yet to be
calculated. Business in Africa is intertwined with government,
which usually owns the telephone system and electric company.
Infection rates in the civil service are high _ in South Africa, as
many as one in seven are thought to be infected. In some countries,
civil servants, who have job security, may legally be home sick for
a year before being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   That is a crisis in the making, said Whiteside. ``You can't run
a company without electricity,'' he said. ``If the power company
loses its technicians, you can't generate electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most companies have been slow to respond, or are still
in denial, a few prescient ones saw the problem coming.
</P>
<P>
   That did not always help.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Rogers runs South Africa's best-known AIDS program for the
Billiton aluminum company in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. It
hands out condoms and brochures in every bathroom, gives health
lectures and aggressively treats workers for venereal diseases,
which increase the risk of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rogers even took a whole museum exhibit on AIDS from
Pretoria to Richards Bay, the little city around the smelters, and
found friendly HIV-infected guides to take 20,000 visitors through
and talk to them about their fears of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she was lucky. AIDS came late to South Africa because
anti-apartheid sanctions kept the borders closed _ though not
airtight _ until 1990. She might have had time to head off the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``for years, the unions blocked it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a belief that the disease didn't exist, because no
one had seen it. And some feeling that it was a plot by the old
government or the United States to keep the black population down
by getting people to use condoms. And there were objections that
condoms aren't part of African culture. And there are traditional
practices here that spread the disease _ such as when a man dies,
his wives become his brother's property so the land isn't split up,
and he is expected to sleep with them.''
</P>
<P>
   She slowly overcame a lot of that resistance, she said. Shop
stewards now double as AIDS educators, and the company hands out so
many condoms that at one point employees were taking an average of
6.2 per day each. ``I think I'm supporting a lot of small
entrepreneurs,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it may all be too late. The infection rate in
surrounding KwaZulu-Natal is now 30 percent, higher even than in
Zimbabwe or Botswana, Africa's worst-hit countries. Those deaths
are yet to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seemed only yesterday, though it was really 10
years ago, that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., believed he
could run a campaign his way _ or more precisely, the way of his
wife and chief political adviser, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the senior senator could afford to be, well, the
senior senator, which is to say capable of the kind of off-the-cuff
intellectual candor that, in today's world of brass-knuckles
politics, would probably find its way into a negative commercial by
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan tells this story to make the point: In 1988, during his
second re-election campaign, he was making a swing through Warren
County, where residents were concerned about PCB contamination in
the Hudson River. Although Moynihan had helped obtain $15 million
to dredge the toxic sediments, no landfill had been found to dump
them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, there is no problem,''' Moynihan recalled.
```There is plenty of room in Hamilton County.' And on the way out,
Liz said, `Well OK, you just lost Hamilton County.' And indeed I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan could afford the loss, since he carried all 61 of the
state's remaining counties. But as he reflected the other day on
his 22 years in the Senate and 40 years in politics and government,
Moynihan, 71, acknowledged that his kind of courtly politicking
would probably be drowned out in today's world of cut-and-slash
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   And though he does not quite say it, he suggested that his
distaste for that style of politics was a reason for his decision
to retire when his fourth term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the way it's going to be,'' he said of the
negative campaigning that seemed to dominate congressional races
around the nation this year. ``I don't think we could do our thing
our way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just one observation offered by the senior senator in a
90-minute inther day on his 22 years in the Senate and 40 years in
politics and government, erview at his Capitol Hill office last
week, where the conversation ranged, as is Moynihan's wont, across
a galaxy of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed for the occasion in his usual college-campus
garb: tan suede shoes, charcoal-gray pants, a green-and-brown tweed
jacket with green bow tie and oversized tortoise-shell glasses. The
office was lined with books, many of them by him. (He has written
or edited 18.) Over the fireplace hung a painting of Jack Butler
Yeats, an Irish painter who was the father of the poet, William,
and beside his wingback chair stood an eerie-looking mannequin that
was meant to resemble Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Though he says his health is good, Moynihan is no longer the
picture of vim and vigor. His gait is slow and labored, and he
sometimes needs help negotiating steps. But he remains as puckish
as ever, to the pleasure and no doubt occasional dismay of his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   When, for example, his receptionist notified him of a coming
meeting on ``fair taxes,'' Moynihan trained a professorial gaze on
the young woman and said, ``Fair taxes? An oxymoron if I ever heard
one. Do you know what an oxymoron is?'' Silence, a nervous smile.
``Fair taxes,'' he finally said. ``That's an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who was first elected to the Senate in 1976, said he
and his wife had ``made up our mind'' after his last election, in
1994, to not run again, though he continued to hint that he might
seek a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he continued to do limited fund raising if he knew he
would not run again, Moynihan said his campaign organization has
continued to do some promotional work for him. ``You need a certain
amount of walking-around money in this job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he had no regrets about his Senate tenure except,
perhaps, his vote against using military force to push Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait in 1991. Asked if he now supports using military
force against Saddam Hussein, Moynihan said yes, but only if the
ultimate goal was to dislodge the Iraqi dictator from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change the regime,'' he said. ``The regime has
made very clear that it does not keep its agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   As for accomplishments, he takes pride in many, and his work
bringing home money for big public works projects stands near the
top. He was the main author of a 1991 law that changed the way the
federal government financed highway and mass transit programs and
that, not coincidentally, diverted significant sums to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan lamented the growing inability of New York and
other big cities to complete the kinds of monumental projects, like
the West Side Highway in Manhattan, that in his mind change urban
landscapes for the better and that ``people remember you for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a political rewards system that changed,'' he said.
``People began to acquire prestige by what they could prevent from
happening. Public works got associated with the bad old day of
Tammany Hall.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan also warned that New York City would lose its
competitive edge if it continued to get less than its share of
federal money. For 22 years, he has helped publish an annual report
showing that New York sends more tax dollars to Washington than it
gets back in federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have that basic capital deficit,'' he said. ``And we have
an attention deficit. In Washington, we are thought to be much
better off than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on this month's congressional elections, Moynihan
said the Republicans may have hurt themselves by running
advertisements making an issue of President Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The public's response was to tell Republican leaders, ``Get rid
of it,'' he said, meaning the impeachment proceedings against the
president. ``And I expect they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has spent two decades in Congress, Moynihan _ who has
also been an adviser to four presidents, ambassador to India and
professor of urban studies at Harvard _ may be best remembered for
his writings on race, ethnicity and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   It was as an aide to President Lyndon Johnson that Moynihan
wrote a now-famous report warning that rising illegitimacy rates
among inner-city blacks would deepen their poverty. Though Moynihan
was accused then of blaming the victim, his thesis is now widely
accepted _ a fact he proudly noted as he showed a visitor a graph
from that 1965 report.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1969, Moynihan wrote an internal memorandum counseling
President Richard Nixon to calm the nation's passions over race. In
a much-quoted phrase, Moynihan said that race relations might
benefit from a period of ``benign neglect,'' by which he apparently
meant that the president should allow the heated rhetoric to cool.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was interpreted by some critics as calling for the
neglect of black Americans, and they accused Moynihan of racism.
Moynihan fretted then that such attacks had ruined him in the
Democratic Party. And he clearly still feels the sting today,
asking a reporter during the interview not to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems of the poor also clearly remain on his mind. He
warned in the interview that the sweeping 1996 welfare law that set
five-year time limits on benefits might have gone too far and could
cause ``a huge hidden calamity'' in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that his proposal to allow taxpayers to invest
part of their Social Security taxes in interest-bearing accounts
could create a new class of people who could leave sizable estates
for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that could have more effect on race in this country
than anything else we're talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his final two years in the Senate, Moynihan talked
about his most recent book, ``Secrecy: The American Experience,''
and about wanting to pass his bill to declassify many government
documents and make it harder for the government to keep secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy needs to be as open as it can be,'' he said.

 &HT;    SOUTHERN RACE SUMMIT OPENS AT HISTORIC BOMBED CHURCH
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Eighteen bombs exploded in black
neighborhoods of Birmingham between 1957 and 1963 -- none worse
than the one that ripped through the Sixteenth Street Baptist
Church on a Sunday morning 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamite rocketed brick and steel through the church's basement,
killing four little girls, shaming a city that had come to be known
as ``Bombingham'' and spurring a reluctant nation to begin the task
of righting its racial wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of black and white Southerners gathered in the restored
church Saturday to look back at the shock and terror of Sept. 15,
1963, as a way to begin a three-day conference addressing the
racism, poverty and inequality of the South today.
</P>
<P>
   They met in the church sanctuary under the watchful gaze of a
black crucified Christ in stained glass -- a special memorial
commemorating the bombing that transformed Sixteenth Street Baptist
Church into one of America's freedom shrines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time can be a great healer of things,'' said Alpha Robertson,
whose daughter, Carole, then 14, died in the dynamite blast at the
church. ``It should not have happened, but we went right on
living.''
</P>
<P>
   And 35 years later, most agreed, the South is a much better
place, even if it falls far short of the ideal the conference
delegates envision for the next century: a region of biracial
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to make certain the next generation of Southerners
live in a more just society, one that values the contributions of
all of its citizens,'' said Sherry Magill, executive director of
the Jessie Ball duPont Fund in Jacksonsville, Fla., which provided
much of the funding for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Congressman John Lewis, recalling the years he spent
organizing nonviolent challenges of the South's oppressive Jim Crow
laws, described how much fear blacks once faced in the South. ``But
the fear is gone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But two prominent white Southerners who joined Lewis in a panel
discussion Saturday suggested it is time for their fellow white to
assume a greater responsibility for improving race relations in the
region and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we white folks do not understand completely
is this business of white privilege,'' said former Gov. William
Winter of Mississippi, who served on President Clinton's racial
advisory board. The board's report said white Americans are mostly
unaware of the political, economic and social advantages they enjoy
simply because they are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most white people think we've come farther in race relations
than black folks think we have,'' Winter added.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he cannot look back on the civil rights
struggle of the 1960s with a clear conscience, Winter nonetheless
expressed optimism that the recommendations of the president's
advisory board can produce public policies that will allow all
Americans to live ``with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Will Campbell, a longtime human rights activist in the
South, lamented that ``things haven't changed that much'' among
white Southerners. He said too many whites ``traffic in
divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be genuine reconciliation until there is
atonement on the part of the offending party,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to predict the future of race relations in the United
States, Winter said he could paint two different pictures -- one,
like Bosnia, filled with ethnic strife; another, ``a model for
civilized people to live together.''

49ERS GAME GIVES FALCONS A CHANCE FOR GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When in danger, the San Francisco 49ers can lean on some of the
most evocative legends in football history. R.C. Owens and the
``Alley-Oop.'' Dwight Clark and ``The Catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McElhenny and Roger Craig and Bill Walsh and Y.A. Tittle
and Joe Perry and Leo Nomellini and Charles Haley and Bob St. Clair
and Ronnie Lott and Jerry Rice and Joe Montana and Steve Young and
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons? They can always conjure up that dance craze
about to sweep the South known as the ``Dirty Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past two decades, the 49ers' ``biggest game of
the year'' usually was played sometime in late January. For the
Falcons, 7-2 for the first time in franchise history, winners of 13
of their past 17 games and locked in a first-place tie with San
Francisco, today at home in the Georgia Dome is close to the
ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is by far going to be the biggest game of the
year,'' Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Falcons, that's a gross understatement. It's more along
the lines of their biggest game of the decade. Maybe that's why
there are so many doubters who wonder: Are the Falcons a legitimate
threat to dethrone a 49ers club that has won the NFC West 12 of the
past 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we execute the way we're capable of,'' 49ers receiver Jerry
Rice said, ``we should win this football game.''
</P>
<P>
   That would qualify as incendiary bulletin-board material if not
for the fact every historical aspect of the San Francisco-Atlanta
matchup supports Rice's view. While the 49ers have dominated the
division, the Falcons have won one division title (1980) in the
past 30 years. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are 40-22-1 against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have won five consecutive games against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have scored at least 30 points in 11 of the past 13
games against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubs' Sept. 27 meeting, San Francisco pounded the
Falcons, 31-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was established that day,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves
said, ``is that we had a lot of work to do in aspiring to be at San
Francisco's level.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the ``Dirty Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end O.J. Santiago popularized the wing-flapping
celebratory dance last weekend after each of his two touchdowns in
a coming-of-age 41-10 victory at New England. Santiago said the
``Dirty Bird'' symbolizes the Falcons' stature as a tough,
hard-working, underappreciated group.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons second-year coach Reeves, the former Cowboys player and
assistant coach who has engineered Atlanta's elevation to
contention, has never been much of a wing-flapping kind of guy.
Instead, his NFL resume suggests a reliance on on-the-field drama.
As coach of the Denver Broncos, he qualified for the Super Bowl
three times, always by utilizing a philosophy that called for both
his offense and defense to keep the game close until the final
minutes, at which point quarterback John Elway was unleashed. In an
unsuccessful stint as the New York Giants' coach, Reeves supporters
can argue his failures can be traced to having to share power with
then-general manager George Young.
</P>
<P>
   But in his native Georgia, Reeves is supreme ruler of the
Falcons' organization _ and most of his decisions have turned to
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a matter of sound defense, ball control and making
the big plays when the time is right,'' said Reeves, whose formula
has the Falcons as the league leader in time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 49ers, who employ an assortment of marquee players to
make their big plays, the key players in the Falcons' surprising
season are veterans, but not household names.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is the fourth-ranked passer in the conference (14 TDs,
nine interceptions, 87.9 rating), but has yet to experience a
winning season in his 11-year career. Running back Jamal Anderson
(219 carries, 966 yards) has six 100-yard efforts in his past seven
games and ranks second in the NFC in rushing. But lack of exposure
keeps the average NFL fan from putting Anderson in the same class
as Terrell Davis, Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But here comes the opportunity for exposure. If the Falcons
defeat the 49ers, or maybe even if they simply play at San
Francisco's level, Atlanta will be recognized as an NFC title
contender.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta victory means attention for the Falcons' unsung
standouts. It means a measure of vindication for Reeves, who has
been known as a can't-win-the-big-one boss. It means an upside-down
look to the NFC West standings.
</P>
<P>
   And it means children all over America might drop ``The Catch''
and start doing the ``Dirty Bird.'' /

DEATH-ROW SURVIVORS TELL HOW JUSTICE ERRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Some walked with a strut, some took halting steps, and
some marched erect, these 27 men and two women who once lived on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them assemble Saturday in the first large-scale meeting
of wrongfully convicted death-row inmates, it was easy to imagine
the walk each was supposed to take alone, from a prison cell down a
hall to a waiting death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   There was the former principal sentenced to die for the killing
of a teacher and her children; the mother condemned for the death
of her baby; the farmer who faced execution for the rape and murder
of his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are back among the living, all 29 having been
exonerated and released from prison. Although most were strangers
before Saturday, their shared brush with court-ordered mortality
brought them together on a law school stage to make a dramatic
point about the fallibility of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come together for one purpose and one purpose only,
and this is to speak out and to stop executions in America,'' said
Randall Dale Adams, who spent 12 years on death row in Texas and
whose case was featured in the film ``The Thin Blue Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at Northwestern University Law School had
particular resonance for Massachusetts, where Governor Paul
Cellucci has made restoring the death penalty among his top
priorities. Massachusetts is one of only 12 states without capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the first National Conference on Wrongful
Convictions and the Death Penalty said their most potent arguments
are the faces and stories of innocent people who once faced
execution. In effect, they are adapting a strategy of death penalty
supporters, who often use victims of horrible crimes to make their
case.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the wrongfully condemned is a switch from
opponents' former tactic of arguing that state-sanctioned killing
is immoral, a claim that failed to keep a majority of Americans
from supportiing capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   As they walked to a podium to the heartbeat-like sound of an
African drum, each former death-row inmate recited what sounded
like a prayer for the redeemed. Delbert Tibbs's version went like
this: ``The state of Florida sought to kill me for a murder I did
not commit. I was sentenced to death in 1974 and finally released
in 1982. Had the state of Florida gotten its way, I would be dead
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Then each placed a sunflower in a crystal vase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare anyone to look at those flowers that they wanted to
extinguish and tell us that their death penalty works,'' said
Lawrence Marshall, a Northwestern University law professor and
organizer of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With that, a crowd of 700 exploded in cheers, and the former
inmates hugged, clasped hands, and raised their arms like winning
prizefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the 29 former death-row inmates present Saturday
are among the 75, including one from Massachusetts, exonerated
nationwide. He compared that number with 486 executions since the
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told Americans that one sausage in 20 they eat is
infested with cockroaches, they would never eat another sausage,''
Marshall said. And yet, he said, there has been one wrongful
death-penalty conviction for every seven executions, and still
capital punishment is widely supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand here at this moment on the brink of a spectacular
opportunity to change public perceptions about the death penalty,''
Marshall added.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the death penalty say that the exonerations
show that the system is working: innocent people are freed, not
executed. They say the risk to society is far greater from killers
who should be executed, but who either escape or murder guards and
other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the risk assessment, I see zero innocent people
who have been executed and I see at least a dozen people, almost
certainly more, who have been killed as a result of the failure to
use the death penalty,'' said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah
law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and other death-penalty opponents have no proof of an
innocent person's execution. But they cited a handful of cases in
which they believe people who possibly were innocent were put to
death, and several others in which there was evidence that the
punishment exceeded the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Sharp, vice president of Justice for All, a Texas
advocacy group for crime victims, said he believes the number of
innocent people who spent time on death row is smaller than the 75
claimed by opponents. Some are innocent, he said, but some were
freed on legal technicalities or because prosecutors were hamstrung
at retrials because of appellate rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are some rare innocent victims, he said, the
benefits of the death penalty outweigh the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use vaccines, we accept that a certain number of
people are going to get sick or die from their use,'' Sharp said.
``It's a social institution, like the death penalty, and we're
willing to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Claims that capital decisions are infallible hold no weight with
poultry farmer Randall Padgett of Alabama, who spent five years on
death row before winning acquittal in the death of his estranged
wife, or with Jay Smith of Pennsylvania, a former high school
principal convicted in 1986 of murdering a teacher and her two
children. In the latter case, the real killer is in prison, and
Smith was released from death row in 1992. He was there 2,329 days,
by his count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes get made, and I'm proof of that,'' Smith said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Massachusetts case on the list of wrongful convictions
involved Lawyer Johnson, a Roxbury man sentenced to death in 1972
for murder. Johnson, who did not attend the conference, was
released from prison in 1982 when a witness, who was 10 years old
when the murder was committed, came forward to say the real killer
was a man who had testified against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' last execution took place in 1947; the death
penalty was on the books for 25 more years but never used. The
Supreme Court effectively invalidated all capital punishment laws
in 1972, then allowed states to reinstate the death penalty four
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say Florida has committed the most known death-row
mistakes, 19. Illinois has made nine, nearly as many as the 11
executions it has carried out since 1976, followed by eight in
Texas, opponents say. Sabrina Butler of Mississippi is one of only
two women on the list. Evidence at Butler's second trial showed
that her infant son was fatally injured not by abuse, but during
attempts to revive him after he stopped breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the climactic meeting of the wrongfully convicted,
leading death-penalty opponents spent two days strategizing about
ways to abolish capital punishment and to defeat efforts to
streamline appeals and quicken the pace of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Barry Scheck, best known as a member of the O.J. Simpson
defense team, announced plans to create a nationwide Innocence
Network, under which law school faculty and students will research
inmates' claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Conference attendees also heard a plea against the death penalty
from former boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, who spent 19 years in
prison, though not on death row, for a triple murder in New Jersey.
Carter's story became fodder for a Bob Dylan song that helped lead
to his release.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was held as 3,517 people, an all-time high, await
execution on death row in 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   Putting faces on that number, and reducing it to zero, was the
conference goal. ``Nothing is the same after this,'' said Joseph
Burrows, who spent five years on death row. ``It destroyed my
life.''

US REJECTS CONCESSION BY IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration dismissed Saddam
Hussein's offer Saturday to let UN weapons inspectors return to
Iraq, maintaining preparations for a military strike on Iraq even
during last-minute diplomatic overtures.
</P>
<P>
   The letter arrived while US B-52s carrying cruise missiles were
in the air headed toward the Iraqi capital. Iraq's 11th hour
overture led to recall of the giant bombers, threw the United
Nations into turmoil and prompted President Clinton to change his
plans to travel Saturday to an important economic summit with Asian
leaders in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iraq said it was making an ``unconditional'' offer to
let the inspectors return, it sent an ``annex'' of nine demands to
the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration rejected the offer, which National
Security Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said ``has more holes
than Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   In a late-afternoon press conference, Berger said Hussein's
offer ``will only lead to confusion in the future'' to
international efforts to ensure that Iraq meets its obligations to
dismantle biological, chemical and nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon continued its military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
A US source confirmed that US bombers were in the air heading
toward Iraq before the letter from Iraq arrived at midday,
prompting commanders to call back the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain backed the United States in rejecting the offer, with
Prime Minister Tony Blair insisting that any capitulation by
Hussein ``must be immediate and unconditional.'' But three other
Security Council members, Russia, China, and France, were more
supportive of Iraq, endangering the fragile anti-Iraq coalition
that had allowed the US buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan at
first said Iraq had met the international community's demands. But
in the afternoon he equivocated, calling Iraq's overture ``a step
in the right direction'' that still needed ``further
clarifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing what might be a prolonged US attack, Iraq said it would
admit the more than 180 inspectors back from Bahrain, where they
have withdrawn in recent weeks after being refused permission to
perform inspections. Iraq softened its insistence that the UN
pledge to ease economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to Annan from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said ``the leadership of Iraq'' had decided to let the inspectors
``practice their normal missions.''
</P>
<P>
   It continued: ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the
aggressive American campaign and the threat to commit a new
aggression against Iraq but as an expression of our feeling of
responsibility, and in response to your appeal and those of our
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But an accompanying ``annex'' spelled out the Iraqi conditions.
In a point singled out by Berger, Baghdad suggested that the
Security Council wrap up a review of Iraq's disarmament record in a
week and begin easing the sanctions. And Iraq obliquely suggested
that the council consider removing the chief UN weapons inspector,
the Australian Richard Butler, and reducing participation of US and
British inspectors on the UN team.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the administration would consider the original letter
without the ``annex,'' Berger suggested that he would not entertain
such hypothetical questions. ``If I were 6-foot-4, I would be a
better basketball player,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not appear in public Saturday but joined his
national security advisers in the White House situation room. ``The
president hopes to complete the Japan, Korea, and Guam portions of
the trip,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who had been monitoring a conference on
global warming in Argentina, was sent to the Asia-Pacific economic
conference in Malaysia, the second such conference that Clinton has
had to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of an imminent attack conflicted with statements from
Pentagon commanders that they would need another 10 days or more to
get the troops in place for a punishing attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Iraq's intelligence services had gotten wind that
a strike was at hand, Berger told reporters, ``You don't have to be
a high-priced Iraqi intelligence officer to know that something was
up.'' Just watching television news was sufficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of an attack, Berger said only, ``We were
poised to take military action and we remain poised to take
military action.''

US REJECTS CONCESSION BY IRAQ

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration dismissed Saddam
Hussein's offer Saturday to let UN weapons inspectors return to
Iraq, maintaining preparations for a military strike on Iraq even
during last-minute diplomatic overtures.
</P>
<P>
   The letter arrived while US B-52s carrying cruise missiles were
in the air headed toward the Iraqi capital. Iraq's 11th hour
overture led to recall of the giant bombers, threw the United
Nations into turmoil and prompted President Clinton to change his
plans to travel Saturday to an important economic summit with Asian
leaders in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iraq said it was making an ``unconditional'' offer to
let the inspectors return, it sent an ``annex'' of nine demands to
the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration rejected the offer, which National
Security Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said ``has more holes
than Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   In a late-afternoon press conference, Berger said Hussein's
offer ``will only lead to confusion in the future'' to
international efforts to ensure that Iraq meets its obligations to
dismantle biological, chemical and nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon continued its military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
A US source confirmed that US bombers were in the air heading
toward Iraq before the letter from Iraq arrived at midday,
prompting commanders to call back the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain backed the United States in rejecting the offer, with
Prime Minister Tony Blair insisting that any capitulation by
Hussein ``must be immediate and unconditional.'' But three other
Security Council members, Russia, China, and France, were more
supportive of Iraq, endangering the fragile anti-Iraq coalition
that had allowed the US buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan at
first said Iraq had met the international community's demands. But
in the afternoon he equivocated, calling Iraq's overture ``a step
in the right direction'' that still needed ``further
clarifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing what might be a prolonged US attack, Iraq said it would
admit the more than 180 inspectors back from Bahrain, where they
have withdrawn in recent weeks after being refused permission to
perform inspections. Iraq softened its insistence that the UN
pledge to ease economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to Annan from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said ``the leadership of Iraq'' had decided to let the inspectors
``practice their normal missions.''
</P>
<P>
   It continued: ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the
aggressive American campaign and the threat to commit a new
aggression against Iraq but as an expression of our feeling of
responsibility, and in response to your appeal and those of our
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But an accompanying ``annex'' spelled out the Iraqi conditions.
In a point singled out by Berger, Baghdad suggested that the
Security Council wrap up a review of Iraq's disarmament record in a
week and begin easing the sanctions. And Iraq obliquely suggested
that the council consider removing the chief UN weapons inspector,
the Australian Richard Butler, and reducing participation of US and
British inspectors on the UN team.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the administration would consider the original letter
without the ``annex,'' Berger suggested that he would not entertain
such hypothetical questions. ``If I were 6-foot-4, I would be a
better basketball player,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not appear in public Saturday but joined his
national security advisers in the White House situation room. ``The
president hopes to complete the Japan, Korea, and Guam portions of
the trip,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who had been monitoring a conference on
global warming in Argentina, was sent to the Asia-Pacific economic
conference in Malaysia, the second such conference that Clinton has
had to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of an imminent attack conflicted with statements from
Pentagon commanders that they would need another 10 days or more to
get the troops in place for a punishing attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Iraq's intelligence services had gotten wind that
a strike was at hand, Berger told reporters, ``You don't have to be
a high-priced Iraqi intelligence officer to know that something was
up.'' Just watching television news was sufficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of an attack, Berger said only, ``We were
poised to take military action and we remain poised to take
military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's string of developments followed a week in which the
United States managed to put together a formidable coalition that
supported an attack, or at least agreed not to oppose it. But that
coalition seemed to break apart Saturday. France urged the Security
Council to test Iraq's word by sending more than 100 UN arms

METEOR SHOWER FORECAST: LEONIDS LIKELY TO BE BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Astronomers want to make one thing perfectly clear:
Chances are, not much will happen during the Leonid meteor shower,
except possibly for those watching the skies in a few far-flung
places. But you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime Tuesday, people somewhere on this planet may be treated
to one of the most spectacular, awe-inspiring sights that can ever
happen in the sky _ a meteor storm, in which so many shooting stars
blaze across the sky that they look almost like snowflakes in a
blizzard. The Leonids, which appear around Nov. 17, produced
astonishing celestial fireworks displays in 1833 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
   This stormy spectacle, if it happens, will most likely be seen
only in Asia and almost certainly not in North America. At best,
New Englanders may see a better Leonid shower than usual, with
rates of as many as one to perhaps four meteors per minute in the
hours after midnight Monday or Tuesday or both. At worst, it may
just be a typical Leonid show with one meteor every few minutes.
But you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best locations, this year's Leonids may just be
slightly better than average, perhaps a few meteors per minute at
peak. That would be comparable to a good year for the better-known
August meteor shower called the Perseids, but nothing to get too
excited about.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some dire predictions, the meteor shower will probably
not affect satellites in orbit, which people depend on for
telephone calls, television transmissions, navigational
information, weather pictures, and a variety of scientific
research. But you never know.
</P>
<P>
   One or more satellites may be temporarily disabled, or even
destroyed, by the tiny hurtling particles responsible for the rare
sky show. Just in case, most satellite operators have already taken
precautions or plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Space Telescope, for example, will be pointed away
from the direction of the incoming stream and will take a
long-duration picture in that safe position.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Murad of the Space Hazards Branch of the US Air Force
Research Lab at Hanscom Field in Bedford, Mass., said last week
that he estimates there is a 1 percent chance of any given
satellite receiving a direct hit from a Leonid particle. With about
650 satellites in orbit, that could mean about a half-dozen would
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, even a direct hit would probably just mean a slight,
and possibly temporary, reduction in power from a satellite's solar
panels _ the largest and most vulnerable part of most satellites.
Murad said he would be surprised if more than one or two satellites
suffered serious, lasting damage. It's more likely that none will,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids, despite leaving blazing trails across the sky, are
actually tiny particles. Most are probably the size of grains of
sand, with some as a large as peas or even grapes. They burn up as
they strike Earth's atmosphere, about 100 miles up, at a rate of 44
miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   These meteors are left behind by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle,
which circles the sun every 33 years on an orbit that nearly
crosses that of Earth. The debris the comet sheds when close to the
sun is spread along its orbit, but with a thick concentration near
the comet itself. That's why sometimes, but not always, the annual
meteor shower gets a big boost in the year just after _ or
sometimes just before _ Tempel-Tuttle makes its approach to the
sun, which it did last January.
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, the shower made a dramatic showing. But probably the
biggest meteor shower ever recorded was the great Leonid storm of
1833, which gave birth to the scientific study of meteors and to a
spate of apocalyptic religious movements, as well. To many people,
a sky blazing with apparently falling stars was a sure sign that
the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have estimated that at the peak of the shower, as
many as 150,000 meteors could be seen in one hour. (A normal year
for the Leonids produces about 20 per hour).
</P>
<P>
   That was an event that drew serious notice, not just from
scientists but from ordinary people, many of whom were awakened by
the bright flashes or by the hullabaloo raised by their frightened
and awestruck neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waked by a neighbor,'' wrote the editor of the Augusta
Courier in Georgia, ``who had also been aroused in a similar manner
by one who supposed the World was coming to an end, as the Stars
were falling. The whole heavens were lighted by falling meteors, as
thick and constant as the large flakes which usher in a snow storm.
We might say, it snowed Meteors.''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread accounts of this storm led people to recognize that
meteors were not an atmospheric phenomenon like lightning, but much
farther above the Earth, in the realm of astronomy rather than
meteorology. By analyzing past reports from around the world, they
soon recognized that such storms had been seen in mid-November
about every 33 years, dating at least as far back as AD 902.
</P>
<P>
   They also figured out where the particles seemed to come from.
By an optical illusion similar to the appearance of train tracks
converging to a point on the horizon, the parallel tracks of the
Tempel-Tuttle particles all appear to radiate outward from the
constellation Leo, hence the name Leonids was applied to the shower
soon after 1833.
</P>
<P>
   But the 33-year storms are not reliable. In 1866 there was
another storm, the first predicted beforehand, though it was not
nearly as dramatic as the 1833 event. But the expected reappearance
in 1900 was far less impressive, and 1933 produced no storm at all.
</P>
<P>
   After carefully studying the path of comet Tempel-Tuttle and the
rec-ords of past Leonid meteor showers going back many centuries,
astronomers think they have a reasonably good estimate of what to
expect this year, but with substantial room for error.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brown, an astronomer at the University of Western Ontario
in Canada, has done a detailed analysis that shows the most likely
place on Earth to be dazzled by the celestial display is in Central
Asia. He is leading a team of 11 scientists who will be observing
the expected shower from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Other
scientific teams will be observing in Australia and aboard two
specially-equipped jets flying over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, reached by telephone last week in Ulan Bator, Mongolia,
said that he expects the Leonids to produce their peak activity
Tuesday at about 2:30 p.m. EST. That's in the wee hours of the
morning in Mongolia, perfect for meteor viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's computer modeling gives a prediction of anywhere from
about 1,000 meteors per hour to as many as 10,000 during the hour
or so of peak activity in Asia, far short of 1966, but worthy of
being called a meteor storm. Astronomer Donald Yeomans of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in California, after analyzing reports of
Leonid sightings as far back as AD 902, has a more conservative
estimate of from 200 to 5,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the sharp peak of activity in Asia, Brown says there
could also be substantially greater rates of meteor activity for
several hours before and after _ rates as high as 200 per hour,
even in the eastern United States _ and that Tuesday night is
likely to have slightly higher rates than Monday night. As with all
meteor showers, the best time to look is after midnight, when we
are on the front side of the Earth as it hurtles through space into
the stream of particles.
</P>
<P>
   The meteors can appear anywhere in the sky, so the best strategy
is to pick a dark site away from city lights and just bundle up,
lie back, and look straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Except for professional astronomers specifically studying these
meteors, ``it's certainly not worth going halfway around the
world,'' said Brian Marsden, director of the International
Astronomical Union's central bureau that alerts astronomers to new
discoveries in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth having a look if it isn't too cold,'' Marsden said.
``If people are insomniacs, they might as well have a look.''
</P>
<P>
   And most likely, they will see a pretty good but not exceptional
meteor shower. Most likely, it won't be the spectacle of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know.

ARAB WORLD LEAVES HUSSEIN ISOLATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  AMMAN, Jordan _ This time the Arab world lost its patience
with Saddam Hussein's game of brinksmanship _ ``Saddam fatigue,''
as one senior diplomat here called it.
</P>
<P>
   And the Iraqi leader's desperate attempts to climb down
yesterday in the face of an ominous buildup of US forces in the
Persian Gulf show one thing clearly: Even a leader as calculating
as Hussein could see he was left almost isolated.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Arab support, according to diplomats and analysts
in the region, proved crucial in Iraq's attempt to defuse what US
officials say was an imminent _ as little as a few hours away _
military strike on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious this is not a repetition of the February
crisis,'' said Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdullah Khatib,
referring to the last standoff between the United States and Iraq
during which many Arab states vocally opposed the US threat of a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction in the region is very different because people
are fearing crises every six months. ... They are tired of it, and
tired of its impact on the region,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis, the third in less than a year, seems to have pushed
Iraq into a relatively quick retreat, although in predictable
fashion Hussein tried to slip in an ``annex'' of conditions to a
letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stating that he would
permit the UN inspectors to return.
</P>
<P>
   The White House last night said it found the letter
``unacceptable'' and made it clear that the United States remained
poised for a military strike.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of support for Iraq this time stretched beyond the Arab
world. Fewer envoys traveled to Baghdad. Even traditional allies in
the UN Security Council, such as Russia, China, and France, spoke
out less stridently against an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof that the Iraq regime is behind the times is that it
still believes in an Arab rebellion from the Mediterranean to the
Gulf that will strike at everything that is American, including
American interests,'' said Al Riyadh, an official Saudi newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No Arab country expressed support for a US strike. And there is
still anger on the streets of Arab capitals at the human suffering
wrought by UN sanctions: UN figures show that an estimated 400,000
additional infant deaths in Iraq are attributable to malnutrition
and lack of medical care brought on by seven years of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   One in three children is believed to be malnourished. In a
country once one of the richest in the Arab world, drinking water
is mixed with sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Voices of Arab anger could be heard here yesterday:
</P>
<P>
   On Amman's Prince Mohammed Street, Fatma al-Houli, a mother of
seven children visiting from Dubai, said, ``It's the people who are
going to suffer, not Saddam. The kids are dying from sanctions.
Saddam is just eating and drinking in his palaces.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mohammed al-Masri, a 29-year-old security guard who works in
Amman but comes from the Nile Delta in Egypt, said, ``The US should
not hit Iraq. It will only hurt more children. You have to separate
the view of Arab leaders from the view of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last standoff between the US and Iraq in February, a
statement from eight Arab nations clearly stated this week that
Iraq would be ``held responsible for any consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi government will be solely responsible for all
repercussions resulting from its decision to block UNSCOM from
carrying out its inspections transparently,'' the statement added,
referring to the UN Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   All eight of the states _ six Persian Gulf nations plus Egypt
and Syria _ participated in the US-led coalition that drove Iraqi
forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But with growing sympathy for the plight of the Iraqi people
during seven years of economic sanctions, the same states expressed
their reservations with the US military action during the last
crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, there were demonstrations in the streets of Amman
that were controlled by baton-wielding riot police. There were
rallies in the West Bank with Palestinian militants holding
cardboard replicas of Iraqi Scud missiles, chanting ``Saddam!
Saddam! Send your Scuds to Tel Aviv!''
</P>
<P>
   So why was the Arab response so muted, even perhaps offered with
a sense of boredom as if the repeated confrontations were staged
and meaningless, this time?
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason may be that there is so much at stake
for the countries in the region. Neighboring states, like Jordan,
Syria, and Turkey, have suffered economically from these crises.
These states rely on Iraq for oil, and the sanctions have
collectively cost them billions of dollars in trade.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is also struggling to cope with a steady stream of
refugees from Iraq. If military action occurs, that stream could
turn into a wave of humanity across their borders and tax Jordan's
already struggling economy and limited resources, especially water.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat of war has also severely hurt Jordan's
$750-million-a-year tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we are just tired of this one crisis after another.
It hurts us very much,'' said one senior government official from a
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions and for the
suffering of the Iraqi people to end, so that we can again become
trading partners with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another significant factor in why Arab leaders were reticent to
support Iraq this time had to do with President Clinton's dogged
diplomacy last month in Wye Mills, Md., forcing a breakthrough in
the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, there was strong sentiment that the United States
had failed to push Israel to live up to the agreement. And this
contributed to a lack of willingness among Arab states to show
support for the tough US stand on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of a double standard, that the United States
is tough on Iraq living up to UN resolutions, but not as tough
pushing Israel to live up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's foreign minister, Khatib, said, ``The credibility of
American foreign policy definitely has been positively affected
since the signing of the Wye agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the economic impact and the linkage to the peace process,
many nations also backed away from defending Iraq this time because
of a perception that its recent move to oust the UN inspectors was
unprovoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were under the impression that things were moving
forward,'' Khatib said. ``We don't understand why Iraq chose to
escalate all of a sudden.''

TULANE BEATS ARMY, 49-35  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ After losing to Notre Dame and Air Force on
consecutive Saturdays, Army could have used a breather this
Saturday. Instead, it had to contend with a third straight top-25
team in Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the Green Wave (No. 14 Associated Press, No.
71 the New York Times computer) came into Saturday's game at 8-0,
the second highest scoring team in Division I-A (42.5 points per
game). Army, meanwhile, had not only lost three in a row, but had
also scored only 37 points in those games while yielding 92.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cadets, in a gallant effort, almost matched that point
total while playing Tulane even through the first half before
succumbing, 49-35, before a crowd of 39,038 at Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It took a record-breaking performance by Tulane quarterback
Shaun King to subdue the Cadets. King, who came into the game
ranked second in Division I-A in passing efficiency, threw for
three touchdowns and ran for three more, completing 23 of 31 passes
for 332 yards and running 17 times for 135 yards. He became the
first Tulane quarterback to amass more than 300 yards passing and
100 yards rushing in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job in executing their offense,'' Army Coach
Bob Sutton said, ``and he made some gigantic plays running the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied four times _ the last time at 28-28 _ before
Tulane scored three of the last four touchdowns in an exciting game
largely devoid of defense. Poor tackling late in the game, along
with several dropped passes, hurt the Cadets (2-7, 2-3 Conference
USA), who pulled to within 7 points at 42-35 on Craig Stucker's
second touchdown run with 10 minutes 54 seconds left. Army then
drove to Tulane's 23-yard line with less than 5 minutes remaining
before a fourth-down pass by Johnny Goff was dropped at the 10-yard
line by split end Gary Williams.
</P>
<P>
   King sealed the victory for Tulane on a 20-yard run with 1:59
left to put Tulane at 9-0 (5-0 Conference USA) for the first time
since 1931, when the Green Wave won all 11 regular-season games
before losing to Southern California in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In his final game at Michie Stadium, the left-handed Goff had
the best game of his career. The senior quarterback connected on 10
of 20 passes for 178 yards _ the first time he had surpassed 100
yards passing _ and a touchdown and led all Army runners with 148
yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny showed a lot of courage and character today,'' Sutton
said of his oft-maligned quarterback. ``Maybe some people will get
off his tail now.''

Lockout a lose-lose situation
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
If this were a normal NBA season, the Rockets would be in Phoenix
today, preparing for an afternoon game against the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley would be holding court as usual, perhaps
explaining why the Rockets went out and nabbed free agent Antonio
McDyess from Phoenix to play alongside Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Olajuwon would be singing the praises of the Clippers'
Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the 1998 NBA draft, whom the
Rockets would have faced in their Nov. 10 game at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   And, if this were a normal season, the Rockets _ especially
rookies Michael Dickerson, Bryce Drew, Mirsad Turkcan and Cuttino
Mobley _ would have had today, Nov. 15, circled on their calendars.
That's because in a normal season, today would have been payday for
most of the 400-plus players in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a normal season.
</P>
<P>
   The league-imposed lockout, which has dragged out to 136 days,
has made that a certainty. League owners and players are wrestling
over how to split $2 billion in revenues, a dilemma that has caused
the cancellation of 97 games, counting today's four.
</P>
<P>
   As the players found out when the union lost its arbitration
ruling last month, no play means no pay.
</P>
<P>
   So for most NBA players, Nov. 15 represents something else this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of payday, many see today as the league's version of
``payback'' day. Instead of receiving their first pay envelopes,
many players think the owners hope they receive the cold slap of
reality across their backsides _ right where their wallets should
be _ today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their idea is clearly to sweat out players,'' said union
executive director Billy Hunter of the owners. ``He wants to test
my resolve and the players' resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of some of those paychecks, there could be a lot
of sweating. Commissioner David Stern estimates the players are
losing $14 million per game in lost pay, which he says they never
will recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal loses $1.25 million every two
weeks. Kevin Garnett, whose six-year, $126 million contract seems
to be mentioned so often as salaries run amok, is out $1.16 million
every two weeks. Miami's Alonzo Mourning loses $1.09 million.
Cleveland's Shawn Kemp drops $811,666 every two weeks. Seattle's
Gary Payton loses $91,463 a game.
</P>
<P>
   And should Michael Jordan sign a $36 million deal for one more
year with the Bulls, as has been rumored, the lockout costs him a
whopping $3 million per check.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Mario Elie puts a different face on the players' lost
wages. Instead of focusing on guys like Jordan, Mourning and
Garnett, he points to players at the other end of the wage scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young guys have families,'' Elie said. ``You have a
lot of guys with responsibilities. I hear people talking about how
we have fancy cars and all that, but there are some other guys who
are legitimate (players) and have families that need taking care
of. I think a good example is a guy like Emanual Davis, who's a
good, solid kid who works hard and who belongs in the NBA. But
right now, it's holding a guy like him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has kids, he has a nice family, and those are the guys I
really worry about. Personally, my funds are fine, but I want to
play. I want to get the fans back in it. I want to go home and
watch ESPN, I want to watch my DirecTV and watch the other teams
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a while.
</P>
<P>
   Agent David Falk, who represents Jordan, Mourning, Patrick
Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, thinks
the owners have more on the line financially should the lockout
cost the NBA the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are Jerry Reinsdorf, who owns a $400 million business
in the Bulls, what do you think it will be worth if they miss a
whole season, the fans revolt and Michael doesn't come back?'' Falk
said. ``Maybe $100 million? Sure, the owners are richer and may
have more staying power. But they also have much more to lose. We
all lose. But they lose more in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, meanwhile, takes issue with owners, fans and media types
who wonder how the missed paydays will affect the players, turning
the lockout from abstraction to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the statement is kind of patronizing and kind of
condescending,'' Hunter said. ``They (the players) don't have to
wait until Nov. 15 not to receive a check, and know that they're
not going to get it, for reality to set in. These guys have
responsibilities _ they have families to take care of. What do they
have to do to demonstrate that they're prepared to take the stand
that they're taking? If you think that their demeanor is going to
change on Nov. 15 and Nov. 30 when they don't get a check, then I
think you and a lot of other people are going to be let down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've prepared them for it. They know it. They're prepared to
miss a check in December if need be. It's not an issue about
reality setting in, but I think that's the antiquated thinking of
the league. They think that something magical will happen on Nov.
15 when the check doesn't arrive in the mail. What's going to
happen is that they would have gotten a ($20,000) check from me
from the group licensing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can assure you that Nov. 15 is going to come and go,
just like Nov. 30, and then we're going to sit down and hopefully
get a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? It's a mind game going on now,'' San Antonio's
Avery Johnson said. ``I think what's happening is that the other
side can talk about not sweating us out, they don't want us to
think about missing checks, but they're sitting there very
comfortably. Probably the average age of owners is, what, 50?
Probably older than that. They've established themselves a lot
longer than a bunch of young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to catch us at the point where we're trying to
establish ourselves in our careers and financially. And they want
us to feel it. Hopefully it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are digging in for the long haul. Owners have the
money from NBC and Turner Sports to keep them going, even though
money for missed games must be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   The players are plotting a series of all-star games, which are
being packaged by Falk, Arn Tellem and Eric Fleisher. Proceeds from
the proposed games will go to the union's lockout fund.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these games could be Dec. 5 or 6 in Las Vegas,
supposedly pitting Dream Team I against Dream Team II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said one source close to the negotiations, ``they can
have that game right after the Beatles reunion concert.''
</P>
<P>
   One former player echoes that sentiment, doubting whether
all-star games, one-on-one contests (which also have been proposed)
or any other pseudo-event will be good for the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, are they kidding?'' the player said. ``Do they really
think the public is interested in a series of those silly,
no-defense 200-198 all-star games? I think they can get by with
one, just because of the curiosity factor, but a series? No way.
It'll be a joke, and I think it will turn the fans off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons fans love NBA games is because of the intensity
and the defense that goes into it. And believe me, there's a lot of
defense played in those games, even though the NBA gets knocked for
having no defense. But that's what people want to see _ effort in a
game that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just a matter of seeing NBA players on the court,
every Clippers game would be a sellout. They need to get back on
the court and play real games.''
</P>
<P>
   How long that will take is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   As long as things remain focused on business, not pride-or
ego-driven, then the players are prepared to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I told our union is that as long as it's about
business, as long as it's not personal , then we can hold out,''
Johnson said. ``But once it gets to be personal and it gets to the
point where I'm in a war and I'm on one side and you're on another
and we're just going to hold our fort, then I don't know if that's
the right solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, games _ and paychecks _ are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Just another normal day in what has become a far-from-normal
season.

PROTESTS EXPOSE MALAYSIAN FAULT LINE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ What began as the controversial arrest
on sex and corruption charges of a politician who challenged Asia's
longest-ruling leader has turned into something much larger, a
mounting drumbeat for change that raises questions about the
nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   If there were doubts about simmering dissatisfaction here, a
couple of thousand demonstrators swept them away last night,
defying government warnings and demanding that their nation's prime
minister step down. Thousands of passing motorists honked their
horns and gave the thumbs-up sign in support.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a gathering of world economic leaders that Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad had hoped would showcase his nation's
technical prowess and business potential, the rally instead exposed
fault lines in this long peaceful society, as the rally briefly
turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Mahathir's former deputy on Sept. 20 and
crackdowns on weekly protests that followed have raised questions
about freedom and fairness and aroused impatience in younger
Malaysians for greater democracy and fresh leadership. For others
who prefer the status quo, however, the movement threatens the
peace and progress Malaysia has enjoyed for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The case against ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is
more than a Monica Lewinsky-style tale that could destroy one man's
career. It is a trial of the very system that catapulted him to
power and has sustained the 17-year rule of Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's tale has all the elements of a political potboiler:
allegations of sex and abuse of power, the downfall of a golden
boy, religion and hypocrisy, conspiracy, generational tug-of-war,
and a nation gripped by uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond Anwar now; it's about justice,'' said Rashid, 47,
a plantation manager who drove 100 miles last night to join what
have become regular Saturday night protests outside a mosque
demanding ``reformasi.'' ``When things are good, you close one
eye,'' he said. ``When things are bad, you see more and more and
get angry. I represent five more people at home, so multiply the
numbers you see here by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse where Anwar's trial adjourned Friday
until after a gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders here this week,
Sabri Zain, 39, an environmentalist, said: ``It's gone well beyond
caring what happens to Anwar Ibrahim. ... Ordinary citizens like me
see institutions we had trust and faith in _ the media, judiciary,
police _ are being manipulated and used towards destroying one man.
For the vast silent majority of Malaysian benchsitters, there's a
big swing. Previously, Mahathir could do no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   From the ebullient scene of banner-waving protesters last night,
one could think the whole nation was suddenly tired of Mahathir.
But there have been no demonstrations outside the cities, and many
Malaysians remain loyal to Mahathir, whom they credit with
transforming a poor, agrarian country into an industrialized nation
with a solid middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever decision Mahathir makes is for the betterment of
Malaysia,'' said Mohd Paris, 36, an accountant. ``Mahathir is not a
dictator, and going to the streets to seek justice is not the
Malaysian way. The trial is testimony that Anwar is being given a
fair chance to defend himself in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for Anwar has become less about guilt or innocence,
however, and more about his alleged mistreatment. When he appeared
in court with a black eye allegedly inflicted by police, some said
the whole nation got a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought, `If the deputy prime minster can get beaten
up, what would they do to me?' You don't need guns to arrest an
entire nation; they use intimidation,'' one local journalist said.
``The facade of a modern society is nice. But it took this to
expose the rottenness of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The case also presents a human drama in the best Shakespearean
tradition: a parable of a prodigal son and controlling father, of
trust and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Mahathir, 72, brought Anwar, a brilliant
young orator and government critic, out of opposition and into the
ruling party and groomed him as his successor. Anwar, 51, said he
would never challenge his ``father,'' but in recent months he
clashed with Mahathir at a party congress and challenged his
closing of markets in an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was ousted Sept. 2, the day after Mahathir closed
Malaysia's currency markets against Anwar's advice. Anwar then
lashed out at his longtime mentor and led demonstrations against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar defenders say his arrest on year-old sodomy accusations is
a politically-motivated frame-up. But skeptics note that at least
three men say they had sex with Anwar, an admission that has cost
two of them prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing when you hear from both sides, so something is
wrong,'' said Mazlan, a taxi driver. ``But whatever he did, he
didn't hurt the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysians assert that no matter how frustrated, they are
peace--loving and reject the violent upheaval that deposed
President Suharto of Indonesia last May. Indonesia also suffers
extremes of wealth and poverty, while Malaysians have basic food
and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolution only happens when people's stomachs are empty,''
said Leslie Lau, 28, a local reporter. ``These demonstrations are
only on weekends. Why? Because people have jobs. You can't count on
the middle class for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Malaysians are speaking out, surprised by their own
courage despite draconian security laws. And it is unclear how they
will react if Anwar is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's rally turned sour at two points: once when apparent
plainclothes officers scuffled with protesters and fired warning
shots and again when demonstrators torched a police motorcycle. A
dozen red riot trucks put out the fire with water cannon, but by
then protestors had dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   The Anwar case has politicized the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit, as 21 foreign leaders start arriving Sunday.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has refused bilateral
meetings with Mahathir, and US Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright plans to meet Anwar's wife _ a slap in the face to the
Malaysian government, which -likened such interference to diplomats
visiting Lewinsky or Kenneth Starr.

TENNESSEE BEATS ARKANSAS, 28-24  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Tennessee had waited 42 years for someone to
call it No. 1, and it did not want to risk waiting that long again.
The Volunteers overcame a poor start, many mental and physical
mistakes and the belligerent Arkansas Razorbacks Saturday to give
106,365 boisterous fans at Neyland Stadium a come-from-behind,
28-24 victory that probably preserved their No. 1 position in the
Bowl Championship Series standing.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which trailed for more than 59 of the 60 minutes and
by as much as 21-3 in the first half, got the chance for its
winning drive when Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner stumbled and
fumbled without being touched on the Razorbacks' 43-yard line with
1 minute 45 seconds left and his team ahead by 24-22. Tennessee's
Billy Ratliff recovered and with 28 seconds remaining, halfback
Travis Henry dove over the left side of a goal-line pileup to keep
the Volunteers' hopes alive for their first national championship
since 1951. Tennessee was briefly ranked No. 1 in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   By maintaining its unbeaten record (9-0), Tennessee remained on
track in the bowl ranking, which will send the top two teams to the
Fiesta Bowl in January to determine a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's bowl ranking, the Volunteers were slightly ahead
of UCLA, which defeated Washington Saturday, 36-24, and Kansas
State, which defeated Nebraska by 40-30. Tennessee was No. 1 in the
Associated Press poll, tied with Kansas State for No. 1 in the USA
Today/ESPN coaches poll and second in the New York Times computer
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Volunteers play for a national championship, though,
they will probably have to play Arkansas again in the Southeastern
Conference championship game on Dec. 5, and the Razorbacks are
likely to be looking forward to that possible rematch.
</P>
<P>
   After playing superbly for most of the way, the Razorbacks,
ranked seventh in the bowl standing, enabled the Volunteers to pull
within 24-22 when their long snapper, Benji Mahan, sent the ball
over the head of punter Steadman Campbell with 2:56 remaining. With
Tennessee defenders charging toward him, Campbell wisely kicked the
ball out of the end zone from the Arkansas 15-yard line, giving the
Volunteers a safety rather than a potential touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after stopping Tennessee on the ensuing possession,
Stoerner gave the ball right back.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, Tennessee looked like anything but the
top-ranked team in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers scored a touchdown moments before halftime to
move within 21-10, but got in more trouble less than two minutes
into the third quarter. After Tennessee forced Arkansas to punt
from deep within its own territory, the returner Jermaine Copeland
lost the ball and watched the Razorbacks' Jeromy Flowers land on it
at the Volunteers' 34-yard line. Though unable to score a
touchdown, Arkansas managed a 33-yard field goal that put it
comfortably ahead, 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's stand must have galvanized the Volunteers because
the rest of the third quarter belonged to them. With Henry running
with the power of a tank and the shiftiness of a sports car,
Tennessee marched 69 yards in 7 plays for a touchdown. Henry
carried 6 times for 58 yards, including gains of 21 and 17 yards,
in the drive. When quarterback Tee Martin scored only the third
rushing touchdown of the season against Arkansas' Southeastern
Conference-leading run defense on a four-yard bootleg to pull the
Volunteers within a touchdown, the stadium began rocking.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a quarter and a half left and the momentum
clearly with the home team, it seemed possible that Tennessee would
overcome its horrible start. When the Volunteers forced Arkansas to
punt after three plays and then drove for a 21-yard field goal by
Jeff Hall, cutting the deficit to 24-20, it seemed definite.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas built a 14-0 lead before Tennessee showed intentions of
fighting for its No. 1 ranking. With the Volunteers committing
numerous mental and physical mistakes, tackling as if they did not
have arms and being juked out of their socks, the Razorbacks took
command and silenced the vaunted Tennessee crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after blowing an opportunity to score on their second
possession when a roughing the kicker penalty gave them a first
down at the Volunteers' 34-yard line, the Razorbacks capitalized on
a jarring hit by Zac Painter that forced Travis Stephens to fumble
at Tennessee's 24. Four plays after D.J. Cooper pounced on the
loose ball, Arkansas went ahead, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The score came when Stoerner found the flanker Emanuel Smith
open but not far from two defenders in the flats. But what should
have been only a short gain became Stoerner's school-record 19th
touchdown pass of the season when Smith spun out of the arms of
Dwayne Goodrich, shook his hips to avoid Deon Grant and pranced 14
yards into the end zone at 5:24 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening play of the second quarter, the deficit was
increased to two touchdowns. Dropping back from his own 39,
Stoerner put up a bomb for Anthony Lucas, who was streaking down
the sidelines with cornerback Steve Johnson at his side. When the
ball arrived, though, Johnson stumbled, allowing Lucas to catch it
easily and sprint untouched for the 61-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a party with more than 100,000 guests
was quickly becoming a funeral, and Hall's 41-yard field goal six
minutes before halftime did little to change that sentiment.
Especially when Stoerner and Lucas struck again three minutes later
to put Lucas in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-yard scoring pass that Stoerner drilled between two
defenders made Lucas, a junior split end, the Razorbacks' career
(17) and season (9) leader in touchdown receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, down by 21-3, the Volunteers came alive, driving 80
yards in 1:12 to score their first touchdown. Martin provided the
spark, hitting Copeland for an 18-yard reception and chalking on
another 15 yards when a Razorback roughed him up after the play was
dead. On the next play, Martin completed a 36-yard fly pattern to
Peerless Price to make it 21-10.

 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Hockey League conducted an investigation Friday
into charges that Flyers center Chris Gratton, who is white,
directed a racial slur at Panthers right wing Peter Worrell, who is
black, during a game Thursday night. The accusations didn't come
from any players, and game officials said they didn't hear anything
of that nature, which led to no action being taken.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was inconclusive videotape from which reporters who
cover both teams read Gratton's lips and believed that Gratton
called Worrell ``a (expletive) ape.'' If Gratton didn't say it,
it's a shame that he was wrongly accused. If he did say it, he
should take a long, hard look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Race is a sensitive issue in the league and it should be. One
incident is one too many. Perhaps as more and more black players
come into the NHL, there will be less need for scrutinizing on-ice
insults. When Swedish players started coming into the league in
significant numbers, they were verbally tortured by other players.
When the Russians and other Eastern Europeans came over, they went
through one hell in exchange for another until they were eventually
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   You can't legislate decency. Ignorance is with us and,
unfortunately, always will be. But on-ice baiting, with players
looking for any edge they can get, will never go away. It has long
been accepted to call your opponent the filthiest swear you can
think of, but most players, whether they be American, Canadian,
European, or Martian, know there are certain lines to be respected.
To go over them suggests a deeper pathology than trying to win a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a line you shouldn't really cross,'' said
Cam Neely, who played 13 years in the league and is trying to stage
a comeback with the Bruins after more than two years of retirement.
``But, I mean, there's a lot said out there that is left out there.
Everybody responds when they're upset different than they would
normally. It seems it's a forum where it's tolerated a little more
what you say to someone on the playing field or on the ice surface
but there's no question there's a line you've got to be careful of
crossing.''

   The difference is whether it's an equal-opportunity insult or
one directed at someone's ethnicity.

   ``There's no question I've probably said a lot of things during
the course of my career that I probably wouldn't say to someone in
the street,'' said Neely. ``But you never are in the position on
the street to have your emotions the way they are (in a game).
People say things mainly because someone did something to them
either physically or verbally. I think a lot of it should be left
out there and most of it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a line you really shouldn't cross. If you feel
bad about what you said hours later, then you probably shouldn't
have said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's (ethnicity), that's something where I wouldn't cross
that line and I think most people feel that way.''

   Montreal forward  &UR; Shayne Corson  &LR; added another chapter to his
feisty legend Wednesday night. After battling New Jersey's  &UR; Denis
Pederson  &LR; with 1:24 left, Corson tried to finish it off the ice. He
had to be held back as he attempted to enter the Devils' dressing
room by a Canadiens equipment man and a security guard. Corson,
whose mouth was bleeding, reportedly got within 8 feet of the
dressing room before being stopped. ``Where is he?'' yelled Corson.
``Tell him I'll kill him next time I see him!'' Pederson later
said, ``Maybe I should have come out. I would have come out to see
what he wanted.'' The teams meet in New Jersey again Dec. 4 ... If
any of the Blues weren't afraid of flying before Wednesday, they
probably are now. The team plane made a hairy landing at Detroit's
Metropolitan Airport. ``We were going sideways,'' said Blues
enforcer  &UR; Tony Twist &LR; . ``How do you go sideways in a plane at 500
miles an hour?'' Former Blue  &UR; Bernie Federko &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now the team's
radio announcer, said it was one of the worst landings he's
experienced. ``Oh, it was bad,'' he said. ``It was near the top of
the list. It was pretty spooky. I'm just happy to be alive.'' ...
These are tough times for Lightning forward  &UR; Benoit Hogue &LR; . He is
back with the club after taking time off to be with his family
following the murder of his younger sister,  &UR; Marlene &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a couple of
weeks ago. ``It was a tragic loss and now I have to put it behind
me,'' he said. ``I was shocked and hurt at the news. Even if you
don't have that much contact with a person, you can't help but
think back to the times you did things together. Life goes on, and
I can't change what happened. I'm trying to block everything out
right now.'' ... The Sharks signed free agent defenseman  &UR; Gary
Suter  &LR; to a three-year, $10 million contract in the hopes he would
shore up the blue line, but he is now out for the season with a
torn triceps tendon. He missed the entire preseason and the first
five regular-season games, then played just 40 minutes, in an Oct.
24 game against Dallas. Sharks GM  &UR; Dean Lombardi  &LR; was prepared for
a worst-case scenario. That led to the acquisition of Acton native
 &UR; Jeff Norton  &LR; from Florida. This is Norton's second stint with the
Sharks ...  &UR; Neal Broten &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 38, turned in an impressive showing for
the United States in the world championship qualification
tournament but he plans to remain retired from the NHL. After he
helped the club avoid dropping into the B pool, Broten kidded that
he was going to go home and burn his skates ...  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; for
 &UR; Ziggy Palffy &LR; ? Maybe. Then again, maybe not. Palffy's agent,  &UR; Paul
Krause &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said, ``(The Islanders) aren't interested in spending
money. So why would they be interested in spending more money for,
arguably, a better player?''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In last Wednesday's 4-0 shutout of the Canadiens, five of the
Islanders' 10 points in the contest came from ex-Bruins. Forward
 &UR; Mariusz Czerkawski &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was slumping badly (no goals and three
assists), had a pair of goals, defenseman  &UR; Barry Richter  &LR; had a
goal and an assist, and  &UR; Ted Donato  &LR; had an assist ... The Long
Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL are drawing hordes of scouts from across
the league. The attraction? An 18-year-old Czech,  &UR; Patrik
Stefan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who stands to be taken early in next June's entry draft.
The club's GM/coach,  &UR; John Van Boxmeer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; says Stefan is a cross
between  &UR; Mike Modano  &LR; and  &UR; Sergei Fedorov  &LR; ...  &UR; Max
Offenberger &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a North Shore resident and close friend of Neely,
has been working with the Rangers as a counselor. Offenberger, a
doctor of educational psychology, has, among other things, helped
players learn that coach  &UR; John Muckler's  &LR; bark is worse than his
bite. ``I'm able to say, `Don't be afraid,' because I know,'' said
Offenberger, a longtime friend of Muckler. ``He may be barking but
he listens, and he's going to help you more than anybody.'' ... The
Capitals are mounting an aggressive campaign to boost attendance,
and the ads are pretty clever. Among the best is a radio spot in
which the announcer says the Capitals are ``the one place in
Washington where the left wing and the right wing always work
together.'' ... The Penguins appear to have staved off their
financial problems, for now. On Thursday, the team agreed to pay
city officials half a million dollars toward its tax debt of about
$1.5 million. The deal, which is subject to the approval of a
bankruptcy judge and contingent upon the team's ability to secure a
$20 million loan to cover their operating costs for the rest of the
year, calls for the Penguins to make monthly payments of $30,000 on
the back taxes and biweekly payments of taxes on games from this
year. The balance would be due in December 1999 ... Lightning tough
guy  &UR; Enrico Ciccone  &LR; sat out a game after being suspended for
elbowing Rangers center  &UR; Marc Savard  &LR; against the boards Tuesday.
Savard wasn't hurt, but the ban is in keeping with the league's
policy of trying to reduce blows to the head. ``I think it was a
fair decision,'' said Ciccone. ``And  &UR; Colin Campbell  &LR; has been
doing a great job since the beginning of the season. He's keeping
guys on their toes.'' ... Panthers GM  &UR; Bryan Murray  &LR; denies a rumor
that he is looking to trade defenseman  &UR; Ed Jovanovski &LR; .

<P>
   The Red Wings clobbered the Blues, 6-2, Wednesday with enforcer
 &UR; Joe Kocur  &LR; scoring a pair of goals. When asked about Kocur's
surprising output, teammate  &UR; Brendan Shanahan  &LR; said, ``He just got
contacts. He discovered his eyesight was really bad. I explained to
him that contacts had been around for a little while.'' Kocur took
the ribbing in stride. ``It's true,'' he said. ``I got them right
after practice Wednesday.'' Kocur's goals came just 25 seconds
apart. After the second one, Shanahan asked him if he'd ever had a
hat trick. ``He said no,'' said Shanahan. ``He says, `Come to think
of it, I think I'd rather get a hole-in-one.' So I don't know if
he's jinxed now.'' ... Going into the weekend, Fedorov had gone six
games without a point. That prompted the talented center to spend
hours reviewing videotape of his last two playoffs in hopes of
snapping him out of it ... The Blackhawks' fortunes continue to
spiral downward. They were trounced, 10-3, Thursday night by the
Maple Leafs at United Center, extending their winless streak to
eight (0-7-1). To add injury to insult, the club lost defenseman
 &UR; Chris Chelios  &LR; (strained groin) in the first period. Center  &UR; Doug
Gilmour &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whom the Hawks acquired in the offseason to add scoring
punch, is clearly frustrated. ``I've got to have the puck more,''
said Gilmour. ``I'm playing the system, but now (coach  &UR; Dirk
Graham &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; says if I get to the line with the puck to try to make a
play. We've got to be more creative with the puck. If I'm chasing
the puck around all night, then I'm not going to be effective.''
Rumors persist in the Windy City that Graham's job is in jeopardy,
but Graham replied, ``I don't get fired from anchor people or
reporters.'' ... After a slow start,  &UR; John Cullen  &LR; has caught some
fire with Cleveland of the International Hockey League. The
34-year-old center, who has staged a comeback from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, had two goals and five assists last Saturday night
against the Chicago Wolves. Cullen, who was demoted by the
Lightning but hopes to make it back to the NHL, had told his wife
and brother the day before that game that he was struggling. ``I
was getting frustrated,'' he said. ``And they all said to me,
`You've only played three games. Relax.' There's no one in sports
who has come back from a bone-marrow transplant. It's actually
better for me because I've had people doubt me my whole career.''
... While we're on the subject of comebacks, a long, loud round of
applause for Boston native  &UR; Paul Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who beat colon cancer
and returned to the NHL ice Friday night to referee Pittsburgh's
game at New Jersey.

PATRIOTS CAN'T STRETCH THEIR LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Last week against the Falcons, the Patriots
looked flat, dead, and uninterested, and that must always reflect
on the coaching staff. If they should play intensely and lose to
the Bills Sunday, it will mean that the coaching staff did their
job but there weren't enough healthy legs to chase Doug Flutie
around the field.
</P>
<P>
   This might be a good time for defensive line coach Ray Hamilton
to suit up. Ditto for assistant director of player personnel Andre
Tippett. It might be a good time for Mike Ruth to come out of the
WBCN booth and play the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the Patriots picked a bad time to have an
injured defensive line and linebacking corps, because Flutie is
probably the most mobile quarterback in the NFL, and he could have
a tremendous advantage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against what will likely be an immobile Patriots front
seven will buy Flutie time. And that's all he's ever needed.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Todd Collins is out, and those considered 50-50 are
linebacker Chris Slade, defensive end Willie McGinest, and
defensive tackles Henry Thomas, Chad Eaton, and Mark Wheeler.
McGinest is the most likely to play.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets game-planned Flutie perfectly last week, and
perhaps their ``contain'' philosophy might suit the banged-up
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have already given up 125 passes for first downs
this season, more than any other NFL team. It's a trend they want
to arrest, and the coaching staff spent all week trying to figure
out ways to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be well-disciplined on rushes as well as
coverage,'' said Carroll. ``We have to change up our rushes.
(Flutie) could put you in a mode where you don't want to rush him.
We have to keep him guessing. He's obviously seen everything you
could possibly see over the years. We won't fool him much, but we
would like to keep him guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger picture is that both teams, at 5-4, need a win to
maintain a legitimate shot at winning the division. The Patriots
came into Orchard Park last year at 5-4 and knocked the Bills out
of the race. But just when it seemed the Patriots had turned the
corner, they were pounded by Tampa Bay the following week. Those
memories linger.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a back-against-the-wall game, a possible
``season-ending'' game, according to defensive back Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must deal not only with their injuries, but also
with the crowd here. Bills patrons are usually among the loudest in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as rowdy a crowd as there is in the league,''
said Carroll. ``It always has been. They won't get discouraged
easily. It's a classic November day in Buffalo, with winds and
conditions, and there might be some rain or whatever. We'll have to
play real well to keep them quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Ty Law's job to keep a leash on Eric Moulds, who is
quickly becoming one of the better receivers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go up against a mobile quarterback, that means
more work for the secondary,'' said Law. ``We've got to stay with
our guys for a couple of seconds longer and sometimes those couple
of seconds can mean everything to whether the play they're running
is successful. Quarterbacks like Flutie can make you tired in a
hurry. That's why our front guys have to chase him down and try to
keep him in the pocket as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel is expected to start at right cornerback, but the
Patriots, who rank 26th of 30 teams against the pass, may take
their chances with Chris Canty covering the older Andre Reed in
three-receiver situations.
</P>
<P>
   The other area the Patriots have to be conscious of is covering
the Bills' tight ends. Jay Riermersma has become a go-to guy for
Flutie. The Patriots haven't defended tight ends that well so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're as attentive to the run as we are, that guy can
get loose sometimes,'' said Carroll. ``We are very aggressive at
the line of scrimmage. Back to the Jets games, there were a couple
of goal-line situations where the tight end got loose. We have to
deal with that.''

CARROLL'S STYLE GETS NO POINTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Kraft is a smart man. He works in the real world, where
results count. He's also an egomaniac who wants to be the star of
his football team. That's why it's going to be interesting when
this season is over to see if he'll cut his losses and deep-six
head coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   There's no joy in writing this. Carroll is clearly a good and
decent man who has been unfailingly polite and courteous to
everyone in town since he took over the Patriots almost two years
ago. I hope my two daughters marry men like Pete Carroll. I just
don't think he should be coaching our local pro football team.
</P>
<P>
   Too soft ... Too nice ... Too laidback ... Too handsome ... Too
fit ... Tries too hard to be one of the guys.
</P>
<P>
   All the cliches appear to be true.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, NFL head coaches are social misfits, deranged maniacs
full of threat and self-importance. Players fear them. They look
like sacks of inner tubes and have no interest in schmoozing with
corporate sponsors. Carroll, to his credit, is none of the above.
But that's also why he's probably not cut out to be a head coach in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk results. Carroll inherited a Super Bowl team. Bill
Parcells left the Super Bowl team and inherited a 1-15 team. Since
the switch, the Patriots and Jets have identical regular-season
records. I find this unbelievable. Kraft should feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's game at Buffalo, the Patriots trail the Jets
in the AFC East by a game. It's going to be a tough haul just
making the playoffs. Carroll has been put on notice that his team
is expected to go deep into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' underachievement is not entirely Carroll's fault,
of course, but things seem a little too loose around Foxborough.
You've got players yelling at the coach in front of the team
(Willie McGinest after the Pittsburgh playoff loss), players
getting arrested (fill in the blank), players diving off stages
into mosh pits (Drew, Zo, Max), and players blowing off
conditioning programs, then taking forever to come back from
injuries (Terry Glenn).
</P>
<P>
   On the field, you have players practicing most weeks only once
in pads. No wonder all the players love Pete. No wonder the Pats
seem out of shape in the second half of tough games. New England
has a young football team, and young players do not improve working
out once a week in pads.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent evidence that Carroll might not be head coach
timber came last Monday when he engaged in an unforgettable
exchange with the Globe's Ron Borges at a routine press gathering.
Borges, along with Will McDonough, the smartest football writer in
town, challenged Carroll to explain last Sunday's debacle. It was a
totally inverted exchange in which a reporter was on the offensive
and the coach appeared polite yet passive. I can only imagine the
reaction if Borges had peppered Rick Pitino, Pat Burns, John
McNamara, or any other head coach in similar fashion. Carroll
remained polite, almost contrite.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches generally think of writers as nuisance
wannabes (can you blame them?), and any Patriot who heard the
Borges-Carroll tape (played several times on WEEI) would have to
wonder about the man in charge. Kraft certainly must be wondering.
</P>
<P>
   The ``please won't you build me a stadium?'' owner is in a tough
spot. He likes to think of himself as a humble mixture of Papa Bear
George Halas, Paul Brown, and Jerry Jones, but it's pretty clear
Kraft made a mistake when he was bowled over by Carroll in a
one-day interview.
</P>
<P>
   The quick decision resulted in Kraft showering Carroll _ who had
no other head coaching offers _ with a five-year contract. It was
somewhat similar to the Red Sox unveiling Daddy Butch Hobson and
telling us they had to move fast because a lot of teams were
interested in Butch.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had one head coaching job before coming to New England.
He went 6-10 with the 1994 Jets. The team lost its last five games
and New Yorkers still claim those Jets quit on Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are banged up and have a tougher second-half
schedule than the teams in front of them. Still, they are supposed
to be the most talented team in their division and they should win
at Buffalo Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Results count, and the results have not been there. Carroll is
no doubt safe for the rest of this season and still has three years
remaining on his ``ThanksBob'' contract. But Kraft's going to face
a difficult decision if his team continues to stumble. It would be
tough to admit he made a mistake. But there's too much money
invested to let this once up-and-coming team continue to stumble.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Ike Quartey was feeling skeptical Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the former welterweight champion sat at a small table in the
All-Star Cafe on Broadway only 10 feet from Oscar De La Hoya, he
saw nothing on the handsome champion's face to ease the doubts he
had harbored even before he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey and De La Hoya had come to Manhattan to explain why
their fight scheduled for Saturday had to be postponed until Feb.
13, but Quartey, like much of the boxing public, wasn't buying the
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him,'' the onetime World Boxing Association champion
said. ``There is nothing. No cut. Nothing! I never believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey believed it even less after he saw De La Hoya emerge
from a block-long limousine, tanned and without any sign of a
scratch on his left eyelid, the one promoter Bob Arum insisted was
cut badly enough a week ago during sparring in Big Bear, Calif., to
require several stitches to close and several weeks to recover
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he could have gone on, but he would have had to stop
sparring for three weeks and go into the fight without being fully
prepared,'' Arum insisted. ``Might it have been different for a
lesser fighter? Absolutely. But Oscar wants to be 100 percent. He
knows this is a tough fight, and he wanted to fight at the first
available date. But not if he wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, is that fighters like De La Hoya don't
have to go through with the fight. If they don't feel 100 percent
ready _ as insiders say De La Hoya did not, barely eight weeks
after a tougher-than-expected rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez _
they get a doctor's note and take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Then they reschedule the bout for a time when they will feel
more comfortable, and lesser champions like Quartey bend to their
will for the simplest reason there is: because there's nowhere else
they can make this kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   That's a simple fact of boxing life, one as old as the sport
itself. Once Jack Dempsey dictated the terms to his victims. So did
Benny Leonard and Battling Nelson and Henry Armstrong and Joe Louis
and Ray Robinson and the great Muhammad Ali. So did Roberto Duran
and Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler and a handful of
others.
</P>
<P>
   It is an edge any boxer would like but very few possess. One who
does is De La Hoya, as Quartey's lying eyes proved to his
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe he was cut when I first heard,'' said
Quartey, who surrendered the WBA title for the chance to fight De
La Hoya. ``I'd heard he wasn't doing good in the gym. People told
me, `Ike, he's not ready.' So now he's trying to buy more time.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya denies that, just as he denied a rumor that Cape
Cod's Kippy Diggs had, in a sparring session, knocked him (A) flat
or (B) out. Diggs, too, insisted the rumor was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one thing De La Hoya did not deny _ his power to
call the shots in these situations and his willingness to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is boxing,'' De La Hoya said. ``Boxing is a sport that's
very negative at times and I have to deal with it. If Quartey is
saying those things, I sense overconfidence on his part. He's a
great fighter, but no fighter should be overconfident. I didn't
want this to happen but I wasn't going to go into that ring with a
wound. That would be dumb on my part, no matter what my opponent
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I have a big advantage over most fighters. I call my
own shots. If I don't want to fight, I don't fight. I pick who I
fight, when I fight, and where I fight. That's the way it should
be. It's not fair that a lot of fighters have to go into the ring
with cuts or when they know they're not ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable knowing I don't have to do that. I don't
have to go into that ring if I'm not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is because of a nicked eyelid or a tired mind, De La
Hoya has refused to go into that ring next weekend and risk all he
had against Quartey, who is strong, unbeaten (34-0-1), and spoiling
for a fight to prove he, not De La Hoya, is the world's ranking
welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey will get that chance in February. Or whenever De La Hoya
is good and ready.
</P>
<P>

   There was a benefit premiere of an HBO documentary on Robinson
at the Roseland Ballroom Tuesday night to raise money for the
children of  &UR; Gerald McClellan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former middleweight champion
who was severely damaged in the ring three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan has been living in the shadows, unable to see anything
but gray, unable to walk without assistance, unable to make much
sense of things. Light heavyweight champion  &UR; Roy Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; HBO, and
Ring 8, an organization dedicated to helping ex-fighters, staged
the benefit, which drew more than 400 members of the boxing
community. It was hoped that $100,000 might be raised, but much
more is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was a rival of McClellan's going back to their amateur
days and has been deeply moved by his plight, brought on by
injuries suffered at the hands of British mid-dleweight  &UR; Nigel
Benn &LR; . Only four days before his fight with  &UR; Otis Grant  &LR; at
Foxwoods, Jones traveled to New York to speak for McClellan and
Robinson and all fighters who have been left in the shadows and
forgotten by their brutal sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our responsibility to look after one another,'' Jones
said. ``It takes a lot to put yourself on the line night after
night not knowing what can happen to us. We never know when the end
may come, no matter how good you are. The only thing that's certain
is that it's on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerald McClellan could have been Roy Jones Jr. or anyone else.
We only box for a short part of our lives, and the longer it goes,
the worse it can be. We need to learn from these situations and
stick together because in boxing when you win, you win with
everybody, but when you lose, you lose alone.''
</P>
<P>

   Promoters  &UR; Don King  &LR; and  &UR; Dino Duva  &LR; finally reached an
agreement Tuesday to stage the  &UR; Evander Holyfield &LR; - &UR; Lennox Lewis
 &LR; heavyweight uni-fication fight at Madison Square Garden March 13.
King bought out Duva's end of the promotion and received a rematch
clause for Holyfield as well as a set fee to be paid him out of
Lewis's next two fights in the event the World Boxing Council
champion dethrones Holyfield. On Friday night, King signed a
contract with HBO to televise the event on its pay-per-view arm,
TVKO. King opened the first meeting with HBO executives by
shouting, ``This is a sharecroppers contract. You're trying to take
me back to the fields! If you gonna take me back to the fields, you
gonna have to pay me!'' No one took his bombast seriously. King's
concern reportedly was over the fact that the deal did not
guarantee him a profit ...  &UR; Mike Tyson  &LR; is expected to announce his
Jan. 16 return to boxing against former International Boxing
Federation heavyweight champion (for a minute)  &UR; Frans Botha  &LR; this
Tuesday. The fight will be promoted by America Presents, the
upstart firm out of Denver run by  &UR; Mat Tinley  &LR; and  &UR; Dan Goossen &LR; ,
who have agreed to a fee (reportedly $200,000 a fight) to promote
Tyson's first two comeback fights. They are hoping to use the stage
a Tyson fight creates to lift their profile while also hoping to
generate enough money to convince Tyson to stay with them ...
Foxwoods will host the 30th annual USA-Russia dual meet Tuesday.
Prior to the fights, USA Boxing will hold a dinner to raise funds
for the 2000 Olympic boxing team. For ticket information, call

BC GETS OUT OF THE PITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Their coach said the team had to dive deep into
``the emotional well,'' and their captain, Brian Maye, said, ``We
knew we couldn't go on feeling the way we were feeling,'' and the
Boston College football team took the proper cues from its leaders.
The Eagles came to Pittsburgh to hit and they came to Pittsburgh to
play.
</P>
<P>
   It will never erase what happened Last Saturday against Notre
Dame (``That'll be with me for the rest of my life,'' said
quarterback Scott Mutryn), but months have passed _ literally _
since the Eagles last won a football game, so Saturday's 23-15 win
over Pitt was as satisfying as could be.
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two teams out there who desperately needed a
victory,'' said Tom O'Brien, the BC coach. ``Our kids went to the
emotional well, came out and played hard from the start and did a
great job, the defense especially. We needed this win.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that BC wasn't sure how to react to that long-gone
stranger _ a victory _ ``and coming off the field, I was standing
there and looking at 'em and they were dead,'' said a most pleased
O'Brien. ``I told them, `You guys have forgotten what it's like to
win.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Cloud never forgot how to run during the six-game
losing streak, and the BC back Saturday set two records as he
gained 179 yards on a career-high 37 carries. Cloud broke Chuckie
Dukes's school record for rushing yards in a season (1,387 in 1992)
and when he gained 4 yards up the middle with 5:19 left, he broke
the Big East season record (1,505), set by West Virginia's Amos
Zereoue last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if Mike had gotten 3 yards,'' said O'Brien. ``I
would have rather won this football game and I'm sure he feels the
same way. But he's got the record and he deserves the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud agreed, saying, ``I'm just glad we won,'' and when pressed
about his personal records, Cloud conceded the only regret of his
happy day: ``I just wish it was done at home.''
</P>
<P>
   BC (4-6) had not won since defeating Temple Sept. 19, and had
not scored first in a game since the season opener, a 41-31 win
over Georgia Tech. But BC cornerback Ramon Johnson helped set the
Eagles on the path to correcting both wrongs, when he leveled Juan
William on the Panthers' first offensive play of the game, causing
a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hit him good,'' said Johnson. ``I didn't even see he'd
fumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   BC took over on Pitt's 44-yard line and quickly enough the
Eagles were in the end zone when Mutryn hit Anthony DiCosmo on a
17-yard TD pass. Pitt tied the score at 7-7 late in the first
quarter when QB Matt Lytle scampered 20 yards for a score, but the
rest of the game belonged to BC, despite the deceptively close
final score.
</P>
<P>
   One of many Pitt bumbles on the day gave BC a 9-7 early lead in
the second quarter. Even after taking a delay-of-game penalty when
attempting to punt from its 27-yard line, Pitt didn't get off a
good kick. The snap flew over the head of punter Greg DeBolt and
bounced back into the end zone, where DeBolt punched it out the
back for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   BC took the subsequent free kick and promptly scored, as Mutryn
fired one of his best passes of the season, letting loose a laser
between two defenders to Dedrick Dewalt for a 30-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line gave Mutryn plenty of time to throw despite
an all-out blitz. Mutryn was able to look off safety D.J. Dinkins,
who committed the folly of going for the ball instead of Dewalt.
The laser was too quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you just have to have the ... well, to be
politically correct ... you just have to have the guts to throw a
ball like that,'' said Mutryn (10 of 23, 106 yards, 2 TDs) with a
laugh. ``I mean, their guy moved an inch and it was a case of
having confidence in myself. I just went for it. What the heck? Go
for a touchdown instead of sitting back there and running around.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson picked off a Lytle pass at the BC 4-yard line with 3:01
left, but BC promptly gave the ball back to Pitt when Mutryn
fumbled a snap two plays later at the 23.
</P>
<P>
   But the Panthers (2-7) were not able to score despite the most
inviting field position, as the BC defense _ tough all day _
stymied Pitt 5 yards from the goal. Nick Lotz, Pitt's freshman
kicker, missed a 22-yarder, his first college attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great series by the defense to hold them there,'' said
O'Brien. ``That might have the key to the game right there.''
</P>
<P>
   BC was in full control in the second half as Cloud personally
wore down Pitt. Pitt had stacked its defense to stop Cloud in the
first half, so the Eagles resorted to throwing the ball; but the
second half was back to BC basics, the line blocking and Cloud
running (he gained 128 of his 179 yards in the final 30 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Cloud scored untouched from the 9-yard line with 52 seconds left
in the third quarter, giving BC a 23-7 lead. A last-minute TD by
Pitt made the final numbers on the scoreboard a bit tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was an air show,'' said Cloud, ``and the second
half was a ground game.''
</P>
<P>
   Add both halves together and BC had what it most needed: a
victory.

   STENDHAL By Jonathan Keates. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Henri Beyle (1783-1842) appeared destined for a
career as a scientist. But circumstances intervened, and he became
a Napoleonic soldier and, eventually, the novelist we know as
Stendhal. Keates' ``prose twirls through Stendhal's peripatetic
career like a gentleman's stick, striking sparks when it taps a
point home,'' Frederick Brown said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN BY THE RIVER By Edna O'Brien. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the author's native Ireland, this novel focuses on Mary
McNamara, a pregnant country girl whose situation is even more
desperate than that of other expectant teen-age mothers: she is to
bear her father's child. After a neighbor learns of Mary's plight
and takes her to England for a legal abortion, Mary becomes a pawn
in an Irish political battle that is as much about
self-righteousness and spite as it is about morality. Last year our
reviewer, Hilary Mantel, called this a ``forlorn, unsparing and
consciously exquisite novel of rural despair.''
</P>
<P>
   DEEPER: Adventures on the Net By John Seabrook. Touchstone/Simon
&AMP; Schuster, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author chronicles his two-year odyssey in cyberspace, a
journey that transformed him from an idealistic enthusiast to an
educated skeptic. ``He is an elegant and lucid writer,'' David S.
Bennahum said in these pages in 1997. The same publisher has also
reissued LIFE ON THE SCREEN: Identity in the Age of the Internet,
by Sherry Turkle ($14), and WHERE WIZARDS STAY UP LATE: The Origins
of the Internet, by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon ($13). Turkle, a
psychologist and sociologist, explores the ways in which the
virtual world both expands and constricts the user's sense of self.
``The result is almost an archeology of changing cultural responses
to the computer,'' Bernard Sharratt wrote in the Book Review in
1995. The history of computers is examined further by Hafner and
Lyon, who describe how the Internet ultimately grew out of Arpanet,
a network that originated with the Eisenhower administration's
Advanced Research Projects Agency. ``The book compiles a great deal
of much-needed information,'' Stephen Manes said here in 1996. The
future of technology is the subject of WHAT WILL BE: How the New
World of Information Will Change Our Lives, by Michael L. Dertouzos
(Harper Edge/HarperSanFrancisco, $14). Here, the founder of MIT's
Laboratory for Computer Science sees the Internet as the
21st-century equivalent of the village marketplace. He
``refreshingly attempts a return to basics, eschewing hype,'' Rick
Prelinger said in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MANIKIN By Joanna Scott. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the false skeletons taxidermists use when
stuffing dead creatures, which are everywhere in this novel. They
fill an old house that was once owned by a natural historian and is
the scene for a Gothic tale, set in 1927, involving the housekeeper
and her daughter. In 1996, our reviewer, Peter S. Prescott, wrote
of one of the author's passages, ``We haven't heard a voice like
that since Ovid wrote his `Metamorphoses.'''
</P>
<P>
   I'M LOSING YOU By Bruce Wagner. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriters, actors, casting directors and numerous other
Hollywood types populate this satiric novel, which deals with the
vicissitudes of life in the film industry. ``The author's
achievement is that almost every character is fascinating, no
matter how hideous,'' Anita Gates said in the Book Review in 1996.
The reality of the business is examined just as acidly in HELLO, HE
LIED: And Other Truths From the Hollywood Trenches, by Lynda Obst
(Broadway, $13). The author, a film producer, counsels other women
while recalling her own experiences. The result is a ``smart,
amusing new memoir,'' David McClintick wrote here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIFE OF GOD: As Told by Himself By Franco Ferrucci.
Translated by Raymond Rosenthal and Franco Ferrucci. University of
Chicago, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   This elegiac novel is a kind of travelogue through the human
universe, executed by the mind that created it but ultimately
cannot control it. In 1996 our reviewer, Jack Miles, called the
novel ``the synthesis of a charming writer's Italy-centered
education and the expression of his boundless hopes for, and
poignant disappointment in, his own human kind.''
</P>
<P>
   A FACE AT THE WINDOW By Dennis McFarland. Broadway, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Cookson Selway, the narrator, is haunted, both literally and
figuratively. Although he has given up drugs and alcohol, he feels
the tugs of his unhappy childhood and of the three disgruntled
spirits who inhabit his London hotel. This ghost story is
``thoroughly satisfying,'' Isabel Colegate wrote in these pages
last year.
</P>
<P>
   FROM BONDAGE: Volume 3 of ``Mercy of a Rude Stream'' By Henry
Roth. Picador USA, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This posthumously published novel by the author of ``Call It
Sleep'' continues the autobiographical story of Ira Stigman, the
young son of immigrant Jewish parents who becomes a celebrated
writer. This volume ``is clearly indispensable to the appreciation
of Roth's unique life and work,'' Frank Kermode said in the Book
Review in 1996.

FLUTIE SHOWS HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ The believers tell you that Doug Flutie
is not even playing his favorite sport right now. You have to
understand that up front, they tell you, if Flutie is to be truly
understood. Flutie is a quarterback, the starter for the Buffalo
Bills. He has taken hold of standard NFL logic as if it were clay,
thrown it on his personal pottery wheel, and reshaped the way
people think about pro football players. But, remember, that's not
to say football is his favorite sport.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is a basketball man first, a quick point guard who can
shoot and penetrate. He still plays five days a week in the
offseason at the Longfellow Sports Club in Natick and loves the
sport because ``it's pure fun; football is work.'' He is also a
hockey man. A baseball man. A soccer man. A golf man. A drummer man
in a rock-and-roll band. A truck-driving man. A pure drive-thru,
fast-food patriot man, pledging allegiance to the nationalistic
jingles of Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   And yes. You look at him and cannot believe that he is a pro
quarterback, a 36-year-old athlete who has led only two losing
football teams in his life (one during his freshman year at Boston
College, the other in the Canadian Football League). One of his
best friends, Paul Ghilani, says that Flutie is the type of person
who will play a football game at 1 o'clock and then ``want to have
a slice of pizza and watch the 4 o'clock game with his buddies. He
is not fancy. He is not materialistic. He enjoys the simple things
in life. He could care less about possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stands well under 5 feet 10 inches in his bare feet and
...
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is usually the point where people start asking for
your credentials. This is usually where people want to know if you
are a licensed-and-registered Flutie believer or not. Ghilani is.
Bills coach Wade Phillips is. Most Canadians and New Englanders and
Western New Yorkers are. But most NFL personnel men are and were
agnostics to the Flutie gospel. Their standard chorus: Too short.
</P>
<P>
   Six MVP awards in eight CFL seasons?
</P>
<P>
   Too short.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-yard pass against the University of Miami that, few
remember, led to the immediate resignation of Hurricanes defensive
coordinator Bill Trout in 1984?
</P>
<P>
   Too short.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Flutie beat the Jaguars with a fourth-down
bootleg in the final seconds. Tom Coughlin, the Jaguars coach and
Flutie's quarterbacks coach for two seasons at BC, cursed and
stomped off as Flutie trotted in the end zone. It wasn't the first
time Flutie annoyed Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to drive Tom crazy with all the stuff he did in the
offseason,'' said Northeastern coach Barry Gallup, who was a chief
recruiter at BC. ``He wasn't just into football. He wanted to play
basketball and baseball, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Too short?
</P>
<P>
   He draws attention just as easily as he avoids linemen. Last
week, a man from Japan was in town, asking Flutie to look into a
camcorder and talk about football. Chris Berman, the ESPN
commentator, recently exchanged football ideas with Flutie.
Afterward, Flutie had more ideas on his mind. Like drop kicking. He
explained that he has always wanted to try that when his team was
near midfield and trailing by a point or two. He would throw a pass
to a receiver over the middle and then have that receiver drop kick
a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that it sounds like Australian Rules Football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' he said. ``You could have one of those guys on your
team just for a play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fun, but according to the NFL it's illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, not many have displayed such offensive creativity in
the NFL in a long time. And from 1990 until the beginning of this
year, no one in the league wanted to take a chance on Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Too short.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie will lead the 5-4 Bills against the 5-4 Patriots Sunday
at Rich Stadium. He used to play for the Patriots. He was
surrounded by more nonbelievers in Foxborough. If he beats the
Patriots twice in the next three weeks, he will most certainly end
their playoff hopes. If that happens, no one will be talking about
size.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort zone
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ghilani, 31, has been a believer for more than half of his
life. He went to Natick High, Flutie's alma mater, and was one year
behind Doug's brother, Darren. Ghilani plays basketball with the
Fluties at Longfellow; plays softball with them in the summer (Doug
plays shortstop and second base); and in the last five years has
been amazed to see Flutie pick up hockey and turn himself into a
good goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He catches everything in the air,'' Ghilani said. ``You can't
beat him high because he's so quick. The only goals he gives up are
the ones between his legs. And you should see him. It's a Sunday
night league and he gets as frustrated when we lose as he would
during a football game on Sunday. We played in a tournament down in
Norfolk and I think Doug gave up two or three goals in four
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie began playing hockey because he was determined to play in
a BC alumni game. Gallup once said that Flutie is the smartest
quarterback he has ever coached. He was also smart when choosing a
hockey position to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goal is the safest spot to be,'' he said. ``Nobody is going to
run you into the boards and trip you. All you have to do is deal
with the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Buffalo, Flutie will be able to study one of the best
goalies in North America, the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Hasek. There
are many things Flutie has already done here that most pro athletes
haven't. It is not unusual to see him hanging around a restaurant,
talking sports with fans. That is his way. He does the same thing
in Natick. He has been going to the Longfellow Club for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I'm comfortable,'' he shrugged. ``Everybody there
knows me. It's nothing special when I walk in the door and we go
play pickup basketball. It's a safe haven for me. Everywhere in
Natick, basically, is my home. Everyone is used to seeing me around
so it's not a big deal. That's the way I like it. Now when I'm
here, I go to the same restaurants all the time because after a
while it becomes not a big deal that you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the average New England fan could be a pro athlete, that
average fan would probably be a lot like Flutie. He likes watching
the Celtics and Bruins. He and his wife, Laurie, hooked up with a
satellite package so they could watch the Indiana Pacers (``My wife
is a Larry Bird diehard.''). He would prefer that people stay out
of his way when he is watching games because, ``I'm there to watch
the game, not to be seen.'' And, even though he tells you that a
long time has passed between the Patriot days of the 1980s, you can
still get him riled with the mention of Raymond Berry and Rod Rust.
He said neither coach had confidence in him. They were
nonbelievers. Not cool.
</P>
<P>
   Pro endorsements
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Flutie is a free-lancing, freestyling quarterback
on the run. But there were times when Berry had him in a
conservative, ball-control attack. He still managed to go 8-5 in
the 13 games he started. He wasn't impressive then, and not because
he was short. He was too inexperienced. During his years with the
Patriots and Bears, he was placed in and displaced from the lineup,
around and around, for parts of three seasons. He never had time to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has excellent technique now. When he first came to the
league, his technique wasn't as polished,'' said Eddie LeBaron,
5-foot-7-inch quarterback who starred with the old Dallas Cowboys.
``I love him. The years in Canada, I think, polished him up. As for
the size, it's hard for people to talk about if they haven't been
back there themselves. I never had a problem seeing passing lanes.
If you have good technique, drop back to the place you're supposed
to and keep the ball in the right position, you're going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to give great dissertations about vision and people
would look at me with glazed eyes. So I stopped talking about it. I
could always see. But I do remember one of my receivers saying that
it looked like my ball was thrown out of a silo, because he
couldn't see where it was coming from. He just knew it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Eddie LeBaron is a Flutie believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great athlete. He's a lot like Steve Young,'' said
LeBaron, who now works in the vineyard business in Northern
California. ``If you can't move _ if you don't have quick feet _
you can't play in the league, no matter how big you are.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true. But even the biggest supporters in the Flutie
congregation disagree slightly. Gil Brandt, the former Cowboys
scout, was one of the few 1980s scouts to praise Flutie as a
potential NFL prospect. Brandt remembers watching the famous
BC-Miami game with Cotton Bowl chairman Jim Brock and ``Jim liked
to smoke a cigar. When Flutie completed the pass, Jim started
choking because he damn near swallowed that cigar whole he was so
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt also admits that when given a choice of what USFL player
to take a chance on in 1985, he suggested Herschel Walker over
Flutie. He said size matters. And it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you're at a dining room table and you have a salt
shaker, a pepper shaker, and a tall glass,'' Brandt began. ``Make
the pepper shaker your quarterback, your salt shaker your receiver
and put the glass in the middle as your defender. You're going to
have a hard time with your vision with that big glass standing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brandt is a heretic?
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes the fastest guy doesn't always win the race. The
slower guy is smarter or more prepared. I think somewhere along the
line, you've got to put productivity in with ability. Especially
with these guys that win at all levels. It's not by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brandt is a true disciple?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before we drafted Troy Aikman, we went out to UCLA to
watch him throw,'' Brandt said. ``We had him throw something like
151 balls and they were all catchable. That's the thing I notice
about Flutie: He throws a very accurate ball. Some of these big,
strong guys still overthrow their receivers by 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you. Before the season, I was asked to pick the
top teams in the league. I looked at all the schedules and rosters
and tried to figure it out. Honestly, I had the Bills in the bottom
five in the league. Now I think they're going to make the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Believers all around. Time for church.
</P>
<P>
   Always the underdog
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the congregation, the biggest and smallest
believer of them all, is Doug Flutie. One afternoon last week he
stood in the Bills locker room, wearing gray sweatpants, a white
turtleneck and a blue skullcap. He was barefoot. It was easy not to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room was Rob Johnson, the quarterback the Bills gave
their starting job to in the offseason. Johnson makes $5 million a
season. Flutie makes $250,000 in a performance-based contract that
could push him over $1 million. Johnson looks like a quarterback
who could do photo shoots for J. Crew stores. He is tall and
generally what personnel men have in mind when they are talking
about The Look.

   But Johnson is not nearly as mobile as Flutie. And in his career
he will have to prove that he cannot play while Flutie will always
have to do the opposite. Johnson, not happy about being made a
backup to Flutie, was talking with assembled media last week. To
his left, a pot of coffee simmered and began to spill over at the
edges. The hot beverage began creeping toward Johnson, but he
didn't see it. It finally seeped under his left hand, causing the
surprised Johnson to shout, ``Oh (expletive),'' and look at the pot
as if it had betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Simple accident. But things like that don't happen to Flutie.
Seriously. As much as he has run around and been pursued by men
twice his size, Flutie has escaped serious injury. Not only does he
throw a good ball, he has confidence and is durable. He privately
wishes people would notice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to him earlier and he said, `Why are people
surprised that I'm doing this?''' Ghilani said. ``He's been an
underdog all his life. But he's won everywhere he's been. He's had
great seasons in Canada, throwing the ball 60 yards and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flutie knows the answer to the Canada question even before
it is asked. Answer: Because the CFL doesn't have the money to
promote itself like the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here, you see all the big flashy ads for the NFL and
NBA,'' Flutie said. ``They just don't have the money to do that up
there. And it's a shame because it's a great product.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFL may even be better than the NFL in terms of true
fanatics. Go ahead. Ask Flutie about a British Columbia Lions fan
named Jake Rambo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a psycho guy who hung around the team,'' Flutie said,
shaking his head. ``He dressed in full uniform and hung outside the
fence and bashed himself into telephone poles and fences. He was
scary. He was the type of guy that you were afraid one day was
going to show up with a machine gun and start shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   That never happened. Rambo was simply a big Flutie follower,
like many others. Some fans, much more reserved, will make the trip
from Natick to Buffalo to watch the game. Even those who don't know
Flutie that well will understand Ghilani when he says, ``No matter
what the situation, Doug always believes he has a chance to win.
Always.''
</P>
<P>
   And let all those who agree say amen.

A PAYDAY MAYDAY?

   The noose starts to tighten a little Sunday. Despite union chief
Billy Hunter's vociferous assurances that his players are prepared
to take their hits, most had not lost a nickel until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the day that many NBA players were to receive their
first paycheck for the 1998-99 season. But the league-imposed
lockout has stopped the checks from coming. Players also will miss
their checks on Dec. 1 and, in all probability, Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the history of the league that players
have not collected checks (excluding the Cavs in the early 1980s,
when there always was a question about whether the checks were
bounce-proof).
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than seven players will lose more than $1 million on
this payday, ranging from Patrick Ewing ($1.54 million) to Hakeem
Olajuwon ($1.078 million). Everyone will take a substantial hit,
but bear in mind these figures represent one-12th of what each
player will earn this season. While some players do get lump sum
payments, the method for calculating losses is one-12th of the
total, based on two payments a month for six months. At least that
was the way it was under the old system, as explained in John
Feerick's decision. And let's not forget: The real loss now is 25
percent (three-12ths) and may go higher.
</P>
<P>
   While many agents have privately expressed frustration with the
pace of bargaining, Hunter says the players are firm and Sunday
will pass just like any other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think their demeanor is going to change on Nov. 15,
you're going to be let down,'' Hunter said last week. ``They are
prepared. But that is the antiquated thinking of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be antiquated. But it also might be effective. No one
likes to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the Celtic losses as of Sunday. Bear in mind that this
would have been a yearly NBA payroll not that long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson: $487,083 (He is being paid by Portland, however.
Think Blazers owner Paul Allen even knows he's getting this break?)
</P>
<P>
   Dana Barros: $291,666

   Nice to see  &UR; Karl Malone  &LR; in midseason form. Malone asking to be
traded ranks right up there with  &UR; Michael Jordan  &LR; saying he won't
play for anyone other than  &UR; Phil Jackson &LR; . The Mailman apparently
is angry at the Utah media, a puzzling target, as well as perpetual
bull's-eye  &UR; Larry Miller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Utah owner. He even went so far as
to blast Miller for not talking to him, even though the lockout
prevents such contact. In addition to his tiresome rant, Malone
also expressed a desire to play for the Lakers, a team that
embodies everything he hates. He even ripped  &UR; Kobe Bryant  &LR; during
the All-Star Game last year and has never been a big fan of Shaq.
The fans in Utah, judging by what's been written, seem to have had
enough of Malone's act. Geez, it wasn't that long ago that Malone
was inviting media guests to his spacious home in the mountains
outside Salt Lake City and telling everyone how great life was.
Other than getting stripped on the most important possession of the
last game of the NBA Finals, what else has happened? ... A trusted
European spy reports that Kinder Bologna is very interested in
signing free agent forward  &UR; LaPhonso Ellis  &LR; and is offering serious
lire to close the deal. Ellis would replace  &UR; Zarko Paspalj &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who,
the spy reports, is regarded as too old (32) and is a chain smoker.
Agent  &UR; Tom McLaughlin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who represents Ellis, confirmed he is
talking with Kinder but nothing is final. ``I can say, however,
that LaPhonso isn't too old and doesn't smoke,'' he said ... USA
Basketball officials met last week in Atlanta and still haven't
decided whether to invite NBA players to participate in next year's
zone qualifier. If the lockout croaks the season, the organization
would be in the same pickle it was this past summer, when the USA
team, composed entirely of NBA players, decided not to participate
in the world championships. If play starts up, then the player
selection committee would meet and decide what to do to name the US
squad for the 10-team field. There's no guarantee NBA players would
be invited at that point, either ... Here's something to think
about as the lockout drones along. There is no drop-dead date.
There will be regular-season games in May. There will be an 82-game
season. There will be ``series,'' as in baseball. That's one
scenario floating around the league office.

   There are some interesting comments from  &UR; Tim  &LR; ``We Hardly Knew
Ye''  &UR; Duncan  &LR; in the latest edition of ESPN Magazine. Out of the
box, Duncan is asked by  &UR; Dan Patrick  &LR; if there are any teams he is
glad did not draft him. Duncan's response: ``I'm gonna get killed
for this. The Clippers and the Celtics.'' Whoa. We can all
understand the Clippers. But the Celtics? We tried to get Duncan to
elaborate, but he was not so inclined, according to his agent,  &UR; Lon
Babby &LR; . Asked about the comment, Babby said, ``I'm off the hook
here because I came on board after San Antonio got the pick. But I
think it might have had something to do with their style of play.''
We also asked Patrick if Duncan had anything further to say about
the Celtics. ``I meant to go back, but then he started talking
about Jordan,'' Patrick said. Later in the Q&AMP;A, Duncan said he was
never a fan of Jordan. Why? ``Because everybody else is. I don't
like Michael Jordan. I respect Michael Jordan. There really isn't
anyone in the world I'm that impressed with.'' ... Ewing is taking
quite a beating for a number of faux pas in his role as president
of the NBA Players Association. Ewing is the proverbial square peg
in the round hole. He has never been media-friendly, starting with
his witness-protection days at Georgetown and extending to New
York, where he's not exactly the go-to guy in the locker room. He
has said some pretty stupid things. But none of his slips means he
isn't doing his job well, any more than being dull would mean that
 &UR; Bill Bradley  &LR; is ill-suited for the presidency. This is an age
when people are judged by how glib they are, which is unfortunate.
Here's agent  &UR; Keith Glass's  &LR; spin on Ewing: ``I have gotten
absolutely nothing of benefit from Patrick Ewing. I tried to
recruit him for UCLA when I was an assistant coach there. That
didn't work. I couldn't even get in the door to represent him. But
I respect Patrick Ewing big-time. He's out there, in front, and for
what? To be ridiculed? This guy has lost more money than anyone
else. He is not angling for a new contract. Why? The guy deserves a
lot of credit if you ask me.'' Yes, Ewing has more money than God.
Yes, Ewing is represented by  &UR; David Falk &LR; , &UR;  &LR; which leads to all
kinds of  &UR; Oliver Stone &LR; -ish scenarios. Yes, he is one of the elite
(albeit without the appropriate jewelry). And no, he's not Mr.
Sound Bite. But neither, for that matter, is  &UR; Paul Gaston &LR; . Or Paul
Allen. They have  &UR; David Stern  &LR; to talk for them. Ewing has no such
luxury, but that's his choice. He's living with the consequences
now ... Falk, meanwhile, said he is not concerned that Walker, his
client, is being shopped around the league. ``It doesn't mean
anything,'' he said. ``( &UR; Scottie &LR; ) &UR; Pippen  &LR; was shopped, too. So was
Olajuwon. The bottom line is that Antoine wants to stay in Boston.
It's a decision that management has to make.'' As for league claims
that Falk is trying to run the union and the negotiations, he said,
``Why would I try to undermine the union when the president is one
of my most important clients?'' He said the entire unseemly process
can be distilled to the following: ``In what business does an
employer make the employees responsible for any downside?''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Another Falk client,  &UR; Allen Iverson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; also is featured in ESPN
Magazine in a first-person ``interview.'' It's long and
self-serving, as you might expect, and it probably won't change
your feelings about the incendiary Philly guard. In the process of
emptying his soul, Iverson reveals that he wants to be the Next
Michael: ``I want to take the baton from Michael when he's gone. I
want to be the heir ... I want the odds against me. That's the way
I've been all my life.'' Iverson also says he'd love for the Sixers
to acquire  &UR; Latrell Sprewell  &LR; (can you imagine that backcourt?) and
feels Mr. Warmth is the second-best shooting guard in the league
after Jordan. But Iverson also said that if he was moved to
shooting guard, he'd lead the league in scoring. ``But that's not
the big picture for me,'' he said. And, in a statement that best
summarizes where the NBA is going, Iverson said, ``Little kids love
flashy players and that's what I try to do with my game ... I want
to be a flashy player. I want to do all the flashy things on the
court. All the things you see on the playground, I want to do in
the NBA and still be effective.'' Bet  &UR; Larry Brown  &LR; loved that.

THEY'RE PLAYING WITH COACH'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of how this season ends up, Pete Carroll is in
trouble. Whether he realizes that or not will determine whether he
finishes his coaching career driving Jaguars, as he now does, or a
Ford Taurus, as many of his Patriot assistants do.
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll took over New England two years ago, he said it was
the best opportunity he could have hoped for, although some people
saw it as a trap because the team was coming off a Super Bowl loss
and anything less than a repeat would be seen as failure.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if something doesn't change, Carroll's leg will end up
caught in that trap.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll must come to grips with this, and fast, or the team he
thought was opportunity knocking two years ago will turn into a
team playing taps over his head coaching career, because something
is rotten not only in Denmark but also in Foxborough, and it is his
team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL teams would be happy to be 5-4, but the Patriots should
not be. Although they are not nearly as talented as some have said,
they also are not so lacking in strength that they should be in
danger of eliminating themselves from the playoffs with a month and
a half to play, as they could do if they lose to the Bills in
Buffalo Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the coaches tottering on the edge of unemployment this
season, Carroll is the most unlikely. He has more than three years
to go on a $1 million-a-season contract and a good, though not
great, team, which for both of his years has reached the second
half of the season facing do-or-die situations in mid-November.
Another division loss and these Patriots will be in worse shape
than the patriots at Valley Forge more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It simply should not be this way for this team. Both Carroll and
owner Robert Kraft know that, and they have to be asking themselves
why this pattern keeps repeating itself with Carroll-coached teams.
</P>
<P>
   If he can find no answer to this, the team Carroll thought was
the best opportunity in pro football may turn into his last
opportunity in pro football because a team that has been designated
the most talented in the AFC East by coaches and commentators alike
is not playing like it, and someone will have to pay for that if it
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me on this: It won't be Drew Bledsoe or Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear what's going on,'' Carroll said last week.
``We have to respond. Our season is in the lurch right now. We have
to come back and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is obvious, but what is more obvious is that this need for
crisis management has become a staple of Carroll's teams.
</P>
<P>
   In his first head coaching stint, back in 1994 with the same
Jets Bill Parcells now haunts him with, Carroll's team collapsed
just when it seemed to be on the brink of a breakthrough. One
minute the Jets were 6-5 and playing Miami for first place in the
division. Next minute they had lost that game on a fake spike and
touchdown pass by Dan Marino that caught Carroll's defense
sleeping. Then they simply collapsed, losing their last five games
to finish 6-10 amid allegations that the players had quit on
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll did not survive that charge. No coach could when it
comes from some of his own players, and so he was fired after just
one season and returned to the relative anonymity of the assistant
coach's life until Kraft plucked him from the San Francisco 49ers'
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll then took a defending AFC champion and put it on a
tightrope for two seasons, turning stability into instability in
fewer than 24 months. A year ago the Patriots faced a crisis
similar to the one staring at them Sunday and survived, rallying
after a disastrous performance in Tampa to finish 10-6 and miss the
AFC championship game by 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the season ended in turmoil. McGinest tore up the locker
room after a 7-6 playoff loss in Pittsburgh, blaming Carroll in
front of the entire team for many of the team's failures. Two
months later, the Patriots handed McGinest a five-year, $25 million
contract that included an $8 million bonus, and people have
wondered who's in charge ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Patriots started fast again but were hit with
injuries and poor play _ not in that order _ losing another
showdown with Parcells's Jets as well as games to Denver, Miami,
and the Falcons. The offense has averaged 13 points a game over the
past month, the defense has become one of the worst in the league
against the pass, and the injury list takes up more pages than a
Don King speech.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says things will be fine once everyone is healthy, but
he is kidding himself if he believes that. Things were not fine
with the Jets in 1994. Things were not fine this time a year ago.
Things are not fine now.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are a part of the problem, but they are not the
problem. The problem is that the leader wants too much to be one of
the boys, and the leaders among the boys are acting like children.
</P>
<P>
   The players whose responsibility it is to make plays have not
made them, and the leader publicly keeps protecting the same
players who are leaving him exposed and vulnerable with inexcusable
performances and injuries that take far too long to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this, for example, with Randall Cunningham, who had bone
chips removed from his knee Monday but is expected to play
quarterback Sunday in Minnesota. Vincent Brisby, on the other hand,
broke a finger and sat out for a month. You tell me which hurts
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Atlanta debacle, Carroll answered his critics
by saying he had met with his team that morning because, ``Today
was a day to challenge our players individually.'' He went on to
say, ``That challenge has been issued.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was right. The challenge has been issued. It has been
issued to him by his players, not the other way around, and if he
doesn't answer it hard and fast and firmly this time, he will learn
the hard way a lesson his friends have been trying to impress upon
him for two years _ that the players are not the coach's friends.
The players are the coach's enemy.
</P>
<P>
   It is they who get him fired. Not newspaper columnists, or
talk-radio mavens, or TV talking heads. In the end, head coaches
get fired by their players.
</P>
<P>
   Such people cannot be your friends.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An angry reader sent in an interesting statistical breakdown of
what he sees as a problem with Carroll's coaching. Operating on the
theory that the opening series is the one a team is most prepared
for, since most offenses script the first 10-25 plays of each game,
he examined the opening offensive series in each of the first nine
games for the Jets, Dolphins, and Patriots. The findings were good
for everyone except New England. In their first nine games,
Parcells's Jets have produced seven first downs and 17 points on
their opening series and gone three-and-out only three times.
 &UR; Jimmy Johnson's  &LR; Dolphins have produced 13 first downs and 17
points, also going three-and-out only three times. Carroll's
Patriots, on the other hand, have only six first downs, have not
scored a single point on an opening drive, and went three-and-out
in seven of the nine games, including the last five. Five of the
six first downs came against New Orleans, on a drive that ended
with a turnover near the goal line ... Here is a difference in
crisis management: While Carroll spent the week playing the role of
The Reasonable Man in Foxborough after his team's 41-10
embarrassment, Johnson was reading the riot act in Miami after a
27-14 victory over the Colts. Johnson was so angry at his team for
giving up two late touchdowns _ as it has been doing lately _ that
he refused to give them the customary Monday off, after a victory
in which they gained 360 yards. ``We're doing enough to be 9-7,''
Johnson said. ``I don't want to be a 9-7 team. We weren't as
attentive in a couple of meetings as I wanted (last week).''
Johnson's concern is that his team has allowed 65 points in the
fourth quarter, after allowing only 58 in the first three. Also,
they are 1-3 and have allowed 43 of those fourth-quarter points on
the road, which is where they'll be in three of their next four
games ... Here's another telling fact about what has been done in
New England since the departure of Parcells: Since the Patriots and
Packers went to the Super Bowl, the Patriots have drafted 19
players and the Packers have selected 16. Of those, Carroll kept
17.  &UR; Mike Holmgren  &LR; had only seven draftees on his active roster
this week. You tell me how the Patriots were right 17 times in 19
tries while the Packers, whose players are picked by one of the
best in the business _  &UR; Ron Wolf &LR;  _ hit on only seven. You tell me
whether you believe that a young team two years removed from the
Super Bowl had to replace a third of its pre-Carroll roster. You
tell me what's going on and what is driving such decision-making.
And you tell me where those 17 draftees are today, because of that
total, exactly one ( &UR; Robert Edwards &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; would be starting against
Buffalo if injuries hadn't forced  &UR; Chris Floyd  &LR; and  &UR; Tony Simmons
 &LR; onto the field. How many starters did the Packers get out of their
seven survivors? Three.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   It's funny sometimes the way things turn out in the NFL. Monday
night the Broncos will oppose the Chiefs relying heavily on the
play of two probable Pro Bowl performers, center  &UR; Tom Nalen  &LR; and
wide receiver  &UR; Ed McCaffrey &LR; . Both were acquired for an obscure
Giants receiver who is no longer in pro football. In 1994, New York
traded a seventh-round draft choice, the 218th selection, to Denver
for a young receiver named  &UR; Arthur Marshall &LR; . That day the Broncos
used what Nalen now calls ``pick 7(c)'' to pluck him off the Boston
College campus. That summer, the Giants cut McCaffrey, then an
obscure fourth-year receiver who had started three games, to keep
Marshall. Marshall went on to catch 87 passes in a five-year career
for 1,269 yards and four touchdowns before being released.
McCaffrey was picked up as a free agent by the 49ers and caught the
eye of then offensive coordinator  &UR; Mike Shanahan &LR; . When Shanahan
took over the Broncos the next season, he brought McCaffrey with
him as a free agent and the rest is a footnote in history. Marshall
is long gone from football while Nalen is a Pro Bowl center and
McCaffrey is leading the AFC with 755 receiving yards ... By the
way, McCaffrey's teammate,  &UR; Terrell Davis &LR; , leads the AFC in
rushing with 1,219 yards. That means Davis and McCaffrey could
become the third tandem from the same team to lead a conference in
those categories ... Usually coaches and players will tell you, ``I
don't read the papers,'' even though everyone knows they do. But
beleaguered Seattle coach  &UR; Dennis Erickson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; when asked if he was
concerned about his job security, said, ``I can read. There's
speculation out there. I read the newspapers occasionally. You know
people have speculation and opinion. Everybody has an opinion. That
doesn't bother me. All I can do is my job. I don't even worry about
it. That's the least of my thoughts right now.'' That's probably
because he has another year to go on his $1 million-a-year
contract, but the fact is if the Seahawks fail to make the
playoffs, Erickson is out, and he knows it. And Seattle may have to
go 5-2 the rest of the way to have a chance at the postseason. With
four AFC losses, including three in their division, the
tie-breakers look grim. Which is why Erickson will be sleepless in
Seattle most of the season ... For his first 5 1/2 years in
Chicago, head coach  &UR; Dave Wannstedt  &LR; and his staff picked the
team's captains. Now he remembers why. When he relented recently
and allowed the players to vote, six were selected. One of them was
not sixth-year wide receiver  &UR; Curtis Conway &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was so upset
that he said, ``It was kind of shocking to me. To have been here
all this time and, whether I was injured or not, to show
leadership, and then for me not to be picked as a captain, it was
kind of a slap in the face. It's all about what have you done for
me lately. That's what we go with.'' If Wannstedt is around next
year, you can't blame him if he goes back to picking the captains
himself.

   If the Cardinals beat the Cowboys Sunday, they will be tied for
first place in the NFC LEast going into the 11th week of the
season. That would be the latest they've been in first place in a
decade, and one of the major reasons is a defense so young most of
them don't have to shave yet.  &UR; Vince Tobin  &LR; has built a defense
that goes into Sunday's game ranked third in the NFC yet is the
youngest in the league in terms of NFL experience, averaging 2.8
years. The Patriots, by the way, are fourth-youngest, averaging 4.6
years ... How bad is the NFC LEast? It has the worst overall record
of any division at 17-28 and is 5-17 in nondivisional games, almost
twice as bad as any other division ... Jacksonville coach  &UR; Tom
Coughlin  &LR; has signed with Parcells's agent,  &UR; Robert Fraley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; so
look for him to try to have his contract restructured. Coughlin is
earning $625,000 in the fourth year of his five-year deal despite
being one of the best young coaches in the game. He is well below
market value and well, well below the $2.4 million deals of
Parcells and Shanahan ... This is the 30th anniversary of the
infamous Heidi Game, when a national TV audience on NBC missed a
roaring Raider comeback that beat the Jets because the game ran
late and the network shifted to the movie ``Heidi.'' The wife of
Jets coach  &UR; Weeb Ewbank  &LR; assumed her husband's team had won since
it led with only minutes to play and was shocked when her husband
told her otherwise. But there is no truth to the oft-told story
that she called him in the visitor's locker room in Oakland to

not help Patriots special teams coach  &UR; Dante Scarnecchia  &LR; rest any
easier, but kick returns for touchdowns are up this year. After 10
weeks, there have been more returned for scores (10) than in any

punt returns have been brought back for touchdowns (11) than in any
season since 1992.

Players weigh overseas option against NBA prestige
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Emanual Davis had one hour to pack his life in a few suitcases and
drag it with him across the planet. The expiration date on his NBA
career was fast approaching. And while he tried to put a price tag
on his dreams, a basketball team in Greece _ he's not sure which
one and it doesn't matter _ came up with a number, if he was
willing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   The money was good _ $150,000 for one season. But it wasn't NBA
money. More than that, it wasn't the NBA. At the end of the hour,
Davis passed on the offer to instead play for nothing while waiting
out the NBA lockout and, he hopes, for a chance to earn a place in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my way out,'' said Davis, a free agent who played in
58 games with the Rockets over the past two seasons. ``I was ready
to pack. I was down to the last hour. I told the guy, `Let me get
back to you in an hour. Let me think about it.' When it was time to
go, I said, `No.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give myself a chance in the league. I worked too
hard on the injuries. I feel like my leg is back to where it was.
(He tore knee ligaments in 1996.) I'm mobile. I'm instinctive
again. I have to give myself a chance before I give it up. And I
think whoever gives me that chance is going to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited six years (including stints in the Continental
Basketball Association and in Italy) to get in. Just because of
circumstances, I'm not playing. I don't think it's because I'm not
good enough. I can't give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, like many players who fight for NBA places, believes if
he leaves for a career overseas, he might never get an offer to
come back. But as soon as Davis explains his intentions to wait for
another NBA chance, he must add there is a richer European offer
that could come, and at $500,000 a year, he would have to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money, a half-million dollars,'' Davis said.
``Then you're talking about taking care of your family. You have to
do that. Something like that can set your family up for the rest of
your life. I want to give myself a chance (at the NBA,) hopefully
in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the lockout drags on, increasing numbers of players
likely will face, even seek, the same decision. Davis and many
players more certain of their NBA careers believe if the impasse
between NBA players and owners continues for another month and
threatens to cancel the balance of the season, there might be no
choice but to search for the sort of act-now offers Davis
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the season opening up _ they announce my name and
the fireworks are going off,'' free agent Mario Elie, a former
Italian league player, said. ``I miss that stuff, and (seeing) the
fans get involved. Now we're losing these fans with each day the
(lockout) is going on, so if I have to go to Italy and hear people
chanting `Mario' in Italian, then that's what I might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to eat spaghetti and meatballs for the next couple
of months, then that's what I may have to do. I'm older now (he
turns 35 this month,) and I can't really afford to miss a year even
though my body and my mind are in good condition. I want to play,
though, and I don't have too many years left to play. I've played
there before, so I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every player with NBA aspirations for the coming season
has chosen to wait out the lockout, most holding out the overseas
option as a last resort. Most of the ones playing around the world
would have gone that route even if the NBA season were not on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Rockets' three first-round picks, Michael Dickerson said
he has little interest in playing overseas, Bryce Drew said Friday
he would look to play in Europe only if the NBA season is canceled,
and Turkcan Mirsad is playing in Turkey temporarily but plans to
return to Houston _ regardless of the lockout status _ by the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves guard Stephon Marbury is perhaps the top player who
has said he would head to Europe if the NBA season were lost. But
many others have said they would consider that option, and perhaps
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players just want to play,'' Elie said. ``That's the bottom
line. Guys may go over there, make a little money in the meantime.
It's something to think about. Everybody's thinking about it. We
want to work. It's boring sitting around here all day. People can
go overseas and get situated. I get calls all the time. But I'm
going to wait a couple more weeks and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of recognizable names are playing for pay overseas.
Teams in Greece, Italy and perhaps Turkey are considered Europe's
best, followed by France, Germany and Israel. Lithuanian teams can
compete with some of the best in Europe, depending on home-grown
talent more than high-profile imports.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in Slovakia, Sweden, Russia and Poland also recruit NBA
talent. Players who might never have gotten much of an NBA shot
also can play for pay in Austria, Australia, the Netherlands, the
Philippines, Portugal, Slovakia and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rockets and Cavaliers guard Elmer Bennett plays in Spain.
Former Lakers guard Frankie King, Celtics forward Dino Radja,
former Nuggets and University of Houston guard Anthony Goldwire are
in Greece. Former Spurs, Knicks and Heat guard Willie Anderson
plays in Israel. Former Spurs forward Zarko Paspalj, and former
Heat and Mavericks guard Predrag Danilovic are in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ed O'Bannon, the former UCLA star drafted by the Nets, plays in
Spain. His former UCLA teammate Tyus Edney, who played in the NBA
for the Kings and Celtics, is on a Lithuanian team with longtime
Magic guard Anthony Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   Former Nuggets guard Kiwane Garris plays in Germany. Former
Mavericks forward Randy White and former Kings forward Byron
Houston are in Russia. Former Nuggets and Kings guard Mahmoud
Abdul-Rauf was recently cut from a team in Turkey, the same team
for which former Rockets, Raptors and Celtics center Zan Tabak
plays and for which former Syracuse forward Conrad McRae is
considered one of Europe's stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball's big there now,'' free-agent forward Chris Morris
said. ``That's where we make our marketing money. That's why you
see NBA teams going over there to play, which is great. Right now,
we're more popular than ever overseas. I think they'll sign more
people than ever to fill arenas. Right now I'm working out every
day. And when the time comes to go overseas, whenever that may be,
I'll be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm holding on as long as I can. But in mid-December I'll be
like everyone else trying to figure out what's going on overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   But several agents said that if every NBA free agent decides to
cash in on a big-money European option, most would be disappointed.
Most European leagues have agreed not to sign players with valid
NBA contracts who cannot get the letter of clearance from the NBA
they need, even during the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Because most European leagues allow no more than two foreign
players per team there will not be enough for the roughly 200 NBA
free agents, or even the relatively small percentage of those
players interested in playing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only so few teams can afford to pay the type of money these
kids are looking for,'' player agent Tony Dutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Said agent Steve Kauffman, who has many clients in Europe:
``Players in the NBA with European passports can play as
non-Americans. But I don't think there will be the plethora of jobs
everyone thinks. Not nearly as many jobs as there might be players
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the lockout, little is certain. Kauffman and several
agents said many foreign players have contracts guaranteed only to
Dec. 15. Increasingly, European teams have offered monthly
contracts, which allow a player to return to the United States if
an NBA opportunity arises, but also might allow teams to upgrade
their foreign talent if the floodgates of NBA talent open.
</P>
<P>
   Many also will find the money is not what they have heard.
Dominique Wilkins obtained the Michael Jordan of contracts three
years ago in Greece when he signed for the equivalent (including
taxes that were paid by the club) of $6.86 million. He will make
just under $4 million in Italy this season.
</P>
<P>
   But most will face choices more like the one Davis has. The top
clubs in Italy, Greece and Turkey offer their top player from $1
million to $3 million. Most of those deals are already taken,
although many wonder if some will become open if the NBA season is
canceled and top-name players look to go overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For now, players wait for a break in the lockout negotiations,
most holding the European option as a fallback position. And most
feel, like Davis, a chance at the NBA is worth risking income and
stardom in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go over there and get stuck because you're getting all the
shots, and the money,'' Davis said. ``Everybody loves the boost of
confidence of being on top. But I don't mind working. I don't mind
being sixth, seventh or eighth guy. That's what I want to be. I
want to be an NBA player.''

PAY-GO OUGHT TO GO AS PART OF SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If House Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston really wants
to do the honest thing and take Social Security off-budget, he'd be
well-advised to link such a move to repeal of pay-as-you-go fiscal
restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Americans aren't likely to see true tax relief ever
again, and Washington will continue to enjoy huge revenue windfalls
as long as continued economic prosperity allows.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston seeks to separate Social Security from the budget,
which would eliminate the surplus illusion. Although the Treasury
reported a $70 billion budget surplus for fiscal 1998, it was due
entirely to about $100 billion in excess Social Security receipts.
Without Social Security's surplus being commingled with general
revenues, the budget would have been almost $30 billion in the red.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security excess was spent, and the trust fund
received an IOU from the Treasury. Until Social Security is
de-linked from the general budget, this process will reoccur every
year until Social Security taxes begin to fall short of benefit
outlays.
</P>
<P>
   When that day of reckoning comes, there won't be any real money
in the trust fund. Thus, Uncle Sam will be forced to redeem the
IOUs by raising taxes, cutting benefits, going further into debt,
and//or rearranging budget priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the trap of Livingston's plan is that it would
make it virtually impossible to reduce taxes because of the
pay-as-you-go budget straitjacket Congress first forced itself into
back in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Such budgeting was implemented to rein in runaway deficits by
requiring that tax cuts be offset by corresponding tax increases,
entitlement spending reductions or both.
</P>
<P>
   Pay-go creates two perverse consequences, according to a recent
analysis by the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation. It not
only fails to curb wasteful spending, but it also prevents
across-the-board tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Since it doesn't allow tax cuts to be offset by cuts in
discretionary spending, pork-barrel waste isn't subject to pay-go's
restraints. Meanwhile, when cutting entitlement outlays isn't
politically advisable, tax machinations become the only game in
town. When this happens, tax cutting becomes a zero-sum game
because relief for some taxpayers must be offset by higher taxes
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Livingston's Social Security accounting-reform bid
succeeds, the loss of this illusory bonanza would create a reality
making almost any sort of tax relief impossible under pay-go.
</P>
<P>
   What Livingston should do first, therefore, is pursue pay-go's
repeal. Under pay-go, Washington's share of national resources
expands whether justified or not. When federal revenue skyrockets,
as it did last year for example, pay-go becomes an insurmountable
barrier to returning at least some of the windfall to the taxpayers
who made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Social Security off the budget is the honest thing to do.
FICA taxes are excessive not because the extra money is being
banked to make up for revenue shortfalls 15 to 20 years from now.
Social Security taxes are excessive because keeping them high has
proved a good way to either disguise the size of humongous deficits
or create the illusion of surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has really changed, though, except that fiscal
duplicity now provides cover for those on Capitol Hill who don't
want to give American taxpayers an even break.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton brushed aside an Iraqi effort
Saturday to back down from its latest stand-off with the United
States, ordered the Pentagon to move forward with preparations to
attack the Mideast nation and cancelled the first leg of a planned
Asia tour to stay home and manage the deepening crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With a massive armada of American war ships, bombers and fighter
jets mustered near Iraq's borders, and more force en route, White
House National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger affirmed
late Saturday that Clinton had given the green light for air
strikes against Iraq shortly before Baghdad's latest overture to
avert attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to Defense Department officials, the B-52 warplanes
from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana had already taken off,
armed with cruise missiles. Scores of air- and sea-launched cruise
missiles, were to be a part of the attack, the officials said,
along with fighter jets and support aircraft based on the naval
carrier USS Eisenhower or in the gulf states of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were poised to take military action,'' Berger told
reporters, ''and we remain poised to take military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other members of Clinton's security team met for some
five hours Saturday to assess an offer from Baghdad to accede to
United Nations demands on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that Iraq's offer was ''unacceptable,'' and had
arrived with ''more holes than Swiss cheese,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every reason to be skeptical, because we have seen
this before, broken and unfilled promises,'' Berger said at a White
House news conference. ''This will only set up a new crisis a few
weeks down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council met into the night Saturday to discuss
the Iraqi offer. But reports from the meeting and official
statements showed members divided over Iraq's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most council members, along with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, reacted positively to a letter from the Iraqi leadership
announcing that its ban on dealing with the inspectors had been
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China welcomed the Iraqi decision to resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, while Britain said it
remained skeptical and was keeping its options open.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, however, made clear the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not negotiating,'' he said. ''We will be consulting with
our friends and allies about next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon moved forward with efforts to deploy an additional
21,000 troops, more than 100 warplanes and an aircraft carrier to
the Persian Gulf region, a plan that would roughly double the U.S.
presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton called off a long-planned trip to Malaysia,
where he was to join his counterparts from 20 other countries
belonging to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the situation in Iraq, the president has decided to
remain in Washington to evaluate appropriate next steps,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart announced, as some 300 journalists and
White House staff members stood by at Andrews Air Force Base, where
they had already assembled for the planned trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dispatched Vice President Al Gore to represent him at
the APEC conference, in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
Lockhart said Clinton hoped to go on three other legs of his
planned trip -- to Japan, South Korea and Guam -- later in the
week, but the Iraqi crisis clearly left even those plans in
question.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Saturday to Annan, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said his government was prepared to allow U.N.
inspectors to return to Iraq immediately ''to perform their normal
duties,'' of investigating the country's alleged chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The letter appeared to rescind Iraqi decisions on August 5 and
October 31 that effectively ended the work of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) charged with verifying Iraqi compliance with
its 1991 pledge to end its program to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cast the Iraqi offer as a constructive effort, telling
reporters at the United Nations, ``I think at least they've made a
step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, however, attached a two-page annex asserting nine Iraqi
positions. They centered on Baghdad's insistence upon a specific
way out of more than eight years of crippling economic sanctions
and on the question of how UNSCOM might be overseen going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials characterized the annex as a catalog of their
government's views, and not as conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, said the annex introduced ambiguity
where clarity was needed and rejected the gesture with tough words
and sharpened threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''This letter is unacceptable,'' said Berger. ''There has to be
a clear, unequivocal statement ... by the Iraqis, that they will
comply with the Security Council resolutions and cooperate with
UNSCOM. What we have instead is a letter, and particularly an
annex, that's got more holes than Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Iraq's long record of skirting the inspection
requirements and impeding UNSCOM's progress with its
on-again-off-again pattern of cooperation and obstruction had left
its credibility in tatters and raised the prospect that a partial
solution to the current impasse might only defer the crisis for
another day.

<P>
   The letter appeared to rescind Iraqi decisions on August 5 and
October 31 that effectively ended the work of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) charged with verifying Iraqi compliance with
its 1991 pledge to end its program to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cast the Iraqi offer as a constructive effort, telling
reporters at the United Nations, ``I think at least they've made a
step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, however, attached a two-page annex asserting nine Iraqi
positions. They centered on Baghdad's insistence upon a specific
way out of more than eight years of crippling economic sanctions
and on the question of how UNSCOM might be overseen going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials characterized the annex as a catalog of their
government's views, and not as conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, said the annex introduced ambiguity
where clarity was needed and rejected the gesture with tough words
and sharpened threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''This letter is unacceptable,'' said Berger. ''There has to be
a clear, unequivocal statement ... by the Iraqis, that they will
comply with the Security Council resolutions and cooperate with
UNSCOM. What we have instead is a letter, and particularly an
annex, that's got more holes than Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Iraq's long record of skirting the inspection
requirements and impeding UNSCOM's progress with its
on-again-off-again pattern of cooperation and obstruction had left
its credibility in tatters and raised the prospect that a partial
solution to the current impasse might only defer the crisis for
another day.

 &HT;    CLINTON BRUSHES ASIDE IRAQI OFFER, REMAINS READY TO ATTACK;
CANCELS ASIA TRIP; UN SECURITY COUNCIL APPEARS DIVIDED
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton brushed aside an Iraqi effort
Saturday to back down from its latest stand-off with the United
States, ordered the Pentagon to move forward with preparations to
attack the Mideast nation and cancelled the first leg of a planned
Asia tour to stay home and manage the deepening crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With a massive armada of American war ships, bombers and fighter
jets mustered near Iraq's borders, and more force en route, White
House National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger affirmed
late Saturday that Clinton had given the green light for air
strikes against Iraq shortly before Baghdad's latest overture to
avert attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to Defense Department officials, B-52 warplanes from
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana had already taken off, armed
with cruise missiles. Scores of air- and sea-launched cruise
missiles, were to be a part of the attack, the officials said,
along with fighter jets and support aircraft based on the naval
carrier USS Eisenhower or in the gulf states of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were poised to take military action,'' Berger told
reporters, ''and we remain poised to take military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other members of Clinton's security team met for some
five hours Saturday to assess an offer from Baghdad to accede to
United Nations demands on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that Iraq's offer was ''unacceptable,'' and had
arrived with ''more holes than Swiss cheese,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every reason to be skeptical, because we have seen
this before, broken and unfilled promises,'' Berger said at a White
House news conference. ''This will only set up a new crisis a few
weeks down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council met into the night Saturday to discuss
the Iraqi offer. But reports from the meeting and official
statements showed members divided over Iraq's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most council members, along with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, reacted positively to a letter from the Iraqi leadership
announcing that its ban on dealing with the inspectors had been
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five permanent members of the security council, France,
Russia and China welcomed the Iraqi decision to resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors, while Britain said it remained
skeptical and was keeping its options open.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, however, made clear the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not negotiating,'' he said. ''We will be consulting with
our friends and allies about next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon moved forward with efforts to deploy an additional
21,000 troops, more than 100 warplanes and an aircraft carrier to
the Persian Gulf region, a plan that would roughly double the U.S.
presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton called off a long-planned trip to Malaysia,
where he was to join his counterparts from 20 other countries
belonging to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the situation in Iraq, the president has decided to
remain in Washington to evaluate appropriate next steps,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart announced, as some 300 journalists and
White House staff members stood by at Andrews Air Force Base, where
they had already assembled for the planned trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dispatched Vice President Al Gore to represent him at
the APEC conference, in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
Lockhart said Clinton hoped to go on three other legs of his
planned trip -- to Japan, South Korea and Guam -- later in the
week, but the Iraqi crisis clearly left even those plans in
question.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Saturday to Annan, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said his government was prepared to allow U.N.
inspectors to return to Iraq immediately ''to perform their normal
duties,'' of investigating the country's alleged chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The letter appeared to rescind Iraqi decisions on August 5 and
October 31 that effectively ended the work of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) charged with verifying Iraqi compliance with
its 1991 pledge to end its program to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cast the Iraqi offer as a constructive effort, telling
reporters at the United Nations, ``I think at least they've made a
step in the right direction.''
</P>

TEXAS A&AMP;M HOLDS OFF MISSOURI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ With 28 seconds left in Texas A&AMP;M's
17-14 victory against Missouri on a soggy, emotion-filled afternoon
of ebbs and flows, Aggies coach R.C. Slocum ordered a time out.
</P>
<P>
   He then huddled on the field with his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than a minute earlier, redshirt freshman Russell
Bynum had kicked what would prove to be the game-winning 39-yard
field goal after Toya Jones recovered a muffed punt at the Tigers'
30-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri was out of time outs, facing a third-and-two from its
43. The key was not only to keep Missouri out of the end zone, but
to keep quarterback Corby Jones from moving the Tigers into
field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Slocum told us just to swarm the ball, swarm the ball,''
Aggies cornerback Brandon Jennings recalled. ``He said that we were
meant to win this game. And that if we gathered together as the
Wrecking Crew, we would win. That's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory clinched at least a tie for a second Big 12 South
title, pending the result of last night's game between Texas and
Texas Tech, and propelled the No. 6 Aggies (10-1, 7-0 Big 12) into
a week off leading up to a much-anticipated battle with the
Longhorns on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   And though the rain-soaked Aggies' fans had to agonize through
four more plays, the Tigers got no further than the A&AMP;M 39. From
there, Missouri kicker Brad Hammerich topped a 56-yard field-goal
attempt that landed harmlessly at the Aggies' 10 as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost that game, I would have transferred to another
school,'' said Jennings, who was one of several players on both
sides involved in weird plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just great to be involved in that kind of a game,''
Aggies offensive lineman Cameron Spikes said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Aggies overcame several mistakes faux pas], as
well as a tenacious Missouri team (7-3, 5-2) that now contemplates
a finale against Kansas State. But the final quirk _ the fumbled
punt by Missouri's Randy Potter _ turned A&AMP;M's way.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, however, that:
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had a holding call that wiped out an interception, and
Missouri went on to score its first touchdown on a 10-yard,
fourth-down run by Corby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Dan Campbell dropped a touchdown pass on the 1-yard
line in the first quarter, necessitating the first of Bynum's three
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings first intercepted a pass, then lost it back to the
Tigers when on the return he tried to lateral to fellow defensive
back Sedrick Curry. Missouri started from the A&AMP;M 27 and proceeded
to tie the game at 14-14 on a 9-yard pass from Jones to tight end
Dwayne Blakely with 7:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M couldn't get a first down. Shane Lechler punted, and the
game turned on Potter's bobble when Jones shoved a blocker into him
and recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big games have plays like that,'' Slocum said. ``There's
always ups and downs when two teams are fairly evenly matched. A
couple of plays and it might not have been as close as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you look at this team all year, they've demonstrated
great heart. They've got as big hearts as any team I've ever been
associated with. They just hang in there and find a way to win. And
it's a different assortment of players who step up and make the
plays we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done starting in September _ going without a
break and winning all 10 of those games _ is really something.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M scored its lone touchdown on a 44-yard drive following a
favorable exchange of punts. Quarterback Randy McCown _ who went
the distance after being questionable because of a shoulder
separation _ scored from the 1 on the third play of the fourth
quarter. McCown then threw to Leroy Hodge for the two-point
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two mishandled punts really cost us today,'' Missouri
coach Larry Smith said. ``We had our chances, but you've got to
make plays. This was one of those games where the team that made
the critical mistakes is the team that loses. Our guys are feeling
anger, severe anger. But we've got a No. 1 team coming in next
week, and we can't let this bury us.''

GENEROUS SMU DONE IN BY TURNOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Reflecting on his final afternoon of competition in the
Cotton Bowl yesterday, SMU senior running back Kelsey Adams
basically had one thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt embarrassed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That probably summed it up for most of the Mustangs yesterday
after Colorado State (8-4, 5-3 Western Athletic Conference) used
six SMU turnovers and four field goals to build a 32-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mustangs (4-7, 4-4), it was a disaster that progressed
in leisurely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much just a matter of our inability to mount any
kind of an offensive threat,'' said SMU coach Mike Cavan, whose
team finally scored a touchdown with 47 seconds remaining on a pass
to Albert Johnson by backup quarterback Josh McCown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had stretches where we moved the ball,'' Cavan noted, ``but
it never produced anything in the way of a scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played pretty well at times, and for a while,
about the only thing they \RColorado State\S did was kick field
goals. But we couldn't do anything to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU, which threw for a total of 500 yards the past two weeks,
managed 73 in this one. The Mustangs lost three fumbles and threw
three interceptions, including four turnovers in five snaps during
one fourth-quarter sequence.four turnovers in five snaps.]
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pitiful, but the game was over by that time,
anyway,'' Cavan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' first touchdown came less than two minutes into the
game on a 46-yard pass from Ryan Eslinger to Derrek Uhl. Their
second touchdown came midway through the final period when they
recovered a fumble in the SMU end zone.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, however, Colorado State's Derek Franz had kicked
four field goals, putting the Mustangs in a 19-3 hole.
</P>
<P>
   The fumble recovery, by linebacker Willie Taylor, came on
McCown's first snap of the game _ from the SMU 2-yard line after
Tracy Hart's interception had halted a Rams drive. McCown missed
Adams on a handoff, and Taylor recovered the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what play Josh thought we were running, but I
went one way and he went the other,'' Adams said. ``He reached out
and tried to force it, but we didn't connect.''

COWBOYS' `MOOSE' BULLS HIS WAY BACK INTO THE ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Why?
</P>
<P>
   The question brings a smile to Daryl Johnston's face. He
remembers all too well the pleas of his parents, siblings, friends
and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Daryl? Why stick your neck out again? Why not retire,
Daryl?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a meeting room at the Cowboys' training complex,
rotating his arms and twisting his thick, surgically repaired neck,
the 6-foot-2, 242-pound fullback, dismissed the retirement talk as
easily as a 250-pound linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after Johnston was diagnosed with a bulging
disk in his neck that threatened to end his career, there are no
more questions. Thanks to successful surgery to fuse the C-6 and
C-7 vertebrae in his neck and a triumphant rehabilitation program,
the 10-year veteran only hears ``Moose'' calls these days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, 32, has resumed his place in the Cowboys' backfield as
a human battering ram for tailback Emmitt Smith. His presence
blocking for Smith and in the locker room is considered a big
reason for the Cowboys' return to the top of the NFC East and their
playoff pursuit that continues today when the Cowboys (6-3) visit
the Arizona Cardinals (5-4).
</P>
<P>
   said Johnston, who added that a magnetic resonance imaging exam
three weeks ago showed the fusion to be in excellent shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for people to understand. But I wanted to be a
part of this turnaround. I didn't want to end my career the way
last season ended. And I wanted the opportunity to end my career on
my own terms.''
The terms
</P>
<P>
   That is a smug look Johnston carries around the locker room.
It's a confident, I-told-you-so countenance he has earned.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was devastated when the bulging disk was diagnosed
following the sixth game of last season. The news rendered Diane,
his wife of two years, ``shocked and speechless'' because she knew
how important playing meant to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was hurting and was getting a magnetic resonance
imaging test,'' said Diane, who models for the Kim Dawson Agency.
``He came in and presented the results to me like the doctors told
him. `I'm done for the year and, until we know more, maybe my
career.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was startling. We haven't been married long and I'm new to
the NFL. But guys like Daryl have a feeling of immortality and
indestructibility.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnston _ whose streak of 149 consecutive games played
ended last season _ predicted his return from the beginning. He and
Diane went out of their way to snuff out negative rumors and news
reports, which ranged from stories about him retiring to possible
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubts,'' Johnston said. ``I was trying to
decide if I should rest it and just try to rehab it or have the
surgery. And the doctor was very strong, he said if we were going
to play, I was going to have to have the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drew Dossett performed the operation on Oct. 31, 1997 at
Baylor Medical Center. The anterior cervical discectomy was
considered a success almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Already buoyed by the knowledge that other players had come back
from the injury, including former Green Bay Packers linebacker
Johnny Holland, Johnston was bolstered even more by how he felt
after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no pain at all,'' Johnston said. ``It was like somebody
flipped a switch. My wife was blown away when I got wheeled back in
the room. I was moving my shoulder. I could sit up in the bed and
it wasn't uncomfortable. If there was any hesitation before or any
possibility that I might not play, as soon as I came out I knew I
was going to be able to do it because I felt so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it became a matter of working to get his strength back.
Johnston said day-to-day life was the toughest. He had to wear a
neck brace 24 hours a day the first six weeks following surgery and
had to sleep on his back. Not being able to drive also provided
some trying times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to rely on Diane to take me places,'' he said. ``It was
kind of hard because you lost your independence.''
</P>
<P>
   He did limited conditioning work while he had the brace on. He
said it was a gradual process once the brace came off.
</P>
<P>
   Spending four hours a day in the weight room, Johnston cleared
every goal six to eight weeks ahead of schedule, said Cowboys
strength coach Joe Juraszek. The strength rebuilding is still an
ongoing process, Juraszek said, and Johnston is about 75 percent of
where he was at his strongest in 1994, the year before he began
experiencing problems with his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve that was affected by the herniation was the one that
controlled the muscles in the left tricep and left chest,''
Johnston said. ``My neck is as strong as it's ever been and some
people say is bigger than ever because of some of the other things
I've been doing. But my most important muscles are obviously the
legs. Having that explosive power is lower-body strength. If I had
an injury that affected my leg strength, that would have forced me
out of the game.''
Changing style
</P>
<P>
   Johnston doesn't exactly know when he started having problems
with his neck. He says he began feeling pinched nerves and noticing
losses of strength during the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, he knows the origin of the problem. Johnston earned his
reputation as a human bulldozer since being selected in the second
round of 1989 draft out of Syracuse. He cleared away linebackers
and defensive tackles that helped guide Smith to four NFL rushing
titles.
</P>
<P>
   But the constant flexing of the neck backward eventually took
its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong-side lead and the weak-side lead were the bread and
butter plays of the old offense,'' said Johnston, named to the Pro
Bowl as a fullback in 1993 and 1994. ``We would call that play 12
to 15 times a game. It's basically two guys with a 10-yard head
start trying to create space in a three-foot area. It's like
knocking you head up against the wall again and again, `boom, boom,
boom.' And until the other team stopped it, they were going to keep
calling it. Something had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's new offensive system, which is based
on zone blocking schemes, doesn't ask Johnston to be a battering
ram anymore. Johnston said the lead plays are still in the offense,
but the strength of Gailey's scheme is the perimeter running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have that big straight-ahead collision as much
anymore,'' Johnston said. ``It gives me a chance to use a different
blocking style. You are going at angles and trying to use people's
momentum to carry them through the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, admits, however that injury has forced him to
concentrate more on his technique as a blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably become more technically sound,'' Johnston said.
``You don't just run in there and smash people anymore. You try to
use anything you can to for an advantage without sticking your head
in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about what would happen. But a person
in their 10th year should start finding a better way to do things,
injured or not. I want to be sound just in case, maybe I can
lengthen my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who is coaching Johnston for the first time, said his
fullback is having an outstanding season. Without him at full
strength last season, the Cowboys finished 20th in the league in
rushing, averaging 102.3 yards per game rushing. With Johnston
nearly back to full strength, the Cowboys are fourth in the NFL in
rushing, averaging 141 yards per game, and Smith is having his best
season since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing everything without missing a beat,'' Gailey said.
``We were concerned in summer camp, but we quickly forgot about
worrying about him. What he brings to this team, statistics don't
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Johnston's return has come so
smoothly he has been guilty of taking his ordeal for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart, team player,'' Jones said. ``He understand the
psychology of what it takes to be a successful team. Daryl is role
model to his teammates. They know it hasn't come easy for Daryl,
and what he has done right here is an example. And when you've done
it the way he's done it throughout his career, it makes him a
leader. It's a big thing to have him in that locker room. It hurt
not having him there as a playing player last year.'' Not ready to
end
</P>
<P>
   One reason many people urged Johnston to give up football is
because they see so many possibilities for him off the field. One
of the Cowboys' most popular players, he has earned widespread
respect for his charity work.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston is most associated with the fight against illiteracy.
He is a spokesman for Half Price Books' education and fund raising
program to promote reading and literacy in Texas. In 1997, Gov.
George Bush named Johnston the state's first Ambassador of Reading.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston has even been approached about running for political
office.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he has no interest in politics, Johnston said he
will probably delve into more philanthropic work when he retires.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has no plans to retire soon. He expects to finish
the final three years on the five-year, $7.4 million contract he
signed before the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jones told him not to worry about the money before
he began his comeback, Johnston admitted the contract was part of
his motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad,'' Johnston said. ``Jerry told me to not let the
contract affect my decision to comeback because he said I already
earned what he did. I appreciated that. But I believe if you sign a
contract. You should be able to honor it. I'm not going to lie,
that was part of why I felt compelled to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the more Johnston talks, the more reasons he comes up
to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Daryl?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of who I am,'' he said. ``I'm a football player. I
look back on what I've done and I'm proud of it. I feel fortunate
to be put in position to take advantage of those opportunities. But
there was still something I wanted to do.''

IRAQ OFFERS STEPS TO AVOID ATTACK; U.S. REJECTS PLAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for latest developments, refinements)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with an imminent American military
attack, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq made a show of backing
down Saturday, saying in a letter to the United Nations that his
government would resume full cooperation with international arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-page annex to the letter outlining Saddam's
interpretation of what he would get in return raised immediate
doubts about his sincerity. Within hours, the Clinton
administration rejected the Iraqi offer as inadequate and
unacceptable, and said American forces remained poised to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to accept the proposition that there will be
compliance, there has to be a clear, unequivocal statement to that
effect by the Iraqis,'' Samuel R. Berger, the national security
adviser, said at a news conference in Washington. ``What we have
instead is a letter, and particularly an annex, that's got more
holes than Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to American officials, the Iraqi move did avert
military action at least for Saturday. Administration officials
said they had canceled a plan to stage a military strike just hours
before it was set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   As a further indication that the White House considered the
crisis unresolved, President Clinton canceled his trip to Asia
Saturday, sending Vice President Gore to Malaysia for an economic
conference of leaders from Pacific rim countries.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.N. Security Council met here Saturday night, the
majority of members took a different view of the Iraqi letter,
saying they were prepared to take Saddam at his word. The council
must now decide whether the Iraqi pledge is enough to review the
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the British remained strong in support of the U.S. position.
In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that until Iraq's
compliance was ``unconditional,'' British forces were ``on alert to
the possibility of military action at any time without further
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The annex, which U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, described in an accompanying note
as something the Iraqis did not want made public, restates demands
by Iraq that have already been rejected by the United States,
Britain and other council members.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, it could reopen divisions and foment
distrust between Russia and the United States in the crucial next
few days. Arriving for a Security Council meeting Saturday, Sergey
Lavrov, the Russian representative, said the Iraqi conditions
mentioned in the annex ``are beliefs that are going to have to be
dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Iraq wrapped its announcement on Saturday in a cloak
of statesmanship. Diplomats here and officials in Washington said
that Saddam, isolated diplomatically by even his friends, had
apparently decided to buy time and head off an American attack now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive
American campaign and the threat to commit a new aggression against
Iraq,'' the Iraqi leadership said in the letter to Annan, ``but as
an expression of our feeling of responsibility and in response to
your appeal and those of our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials argued that the Iraqis were not hedging their
decision to resume cooperation, and that the annex to their letter
was no more than a wish list. ``Our understanding is that the annex
to the letter does not constitute conditions,'' said Fred Eckhard,
Annan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the day, Annan appeared to be less optimistic.
Arriving at the United Nations late in the afternoon before the
council meeting, he was asked if he was hopeful that the crisis had
passed. ``I think it made at least a step in the right direction,''
he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's representative to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon,
said: ``The annex that was delivered with the letter today contains
the views and the preferences of the government of Iraq on the
comprehensive review that has been agreed in principle by the
Security Council before this recent crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon said that the annex was merely a talking paper that
Baghdad had shared with several other nations and that the nine
points were not conditions for Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The annex is a copy of Iraqi policy points as they were
presented to Russia, China and France on Friday. The policy summary
was mentioned in the letter as a description of what Iraq would
consider a ``serious, fair and fruitful'' review.
</P>
<P>
   It asks that Baghdad be given direct assurances by the
secretary-general or ``a delegation from the council'' that its
demands, many of which have already been rejected, be taken into
account now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It also asks that the comprehensive review of relations with the
United Nations ``be carried out within a very short time, (seven
days for example),'' after arms inspectors resume their work. The
United States has already suggested that four to six weeks would be
more realistic, to allow time to see if inspections were really
unfettered.
</P>
<P>
   The annex makes clear that Iraq wants to shift the burden of
evidence to the U.N. Special Commission, known as Unscom, forcing
it to prove what Iraq is supposed to be hiding rather than allowing
the commission to continue compelling Baghdad to produce answers
and missing documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis want a timetable _ ``a short period,'' they say _ for
them to take whatever steps are necessary to close files on weapons
programs. Inspectors fear that this will result in pro-forma
inspections, after which the Iraqis could declare they had met all
their obligations so the oil embargo could be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The annex again raises questions about the future of Richard
Butler, the executive chairman of Unscom, whom Iraq wants
dismissed, and of the commission itself, which Iraq wants to make
part of the U.N. system. It is now a free-standing creation of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also reiterated their preference for a comprehensive
review to be conducted under Annan's direction. The Security
Council has already said it will run that review.
</P>
<P>
   In their public letter to the secretary-general, the Iraqis said
the decision to resume cooperation was made Saturday at meetings of
the president's Cabinet and party, with Saddam presiding.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings followed the receipt of a letter on Friday night
from Annan reiterating the secretary-general's warning, in effect,
that Iraq could never hope to have sanctions lifted unless it
played by the rules, and by appeals from Russia, China and France,
among others, the Iraqis said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against recent evidence, the letter states that ``the
goal sought by Iraq was not to sever the relationship with Unscom
and the IAEA,'' the two arms agencies monitoring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of Iraq decided to resume working with the
Special Commission and the IAEA and to allow them to perform their
normal duties,'' the Iraqi letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint that Iraqi would back down came early today from
an unidentified Iraqi official in Baghdad. A few hours later, Shah,
Annan's special envoy in Iraq, said publicly that the Iraqis had
agreed ``without conditions'' to resume cooperation, which was
broken off by Saddam on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   As Shah spoke, the secretary-general was meeting with Hamdoon at
Annan's official residence in New York. There, Annan took a call
from Aziz, and they discussed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made a last-minute appeal to Saddam in a letter on Friday
night, after a meeting with the Security Council that lasted nearly
five hours. The secretary-general, who had abruptly cut off a trip
in North Africa on Wednesday to confront the crisis, said after the
marathon session that ``events on the ground seem to be running
away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Iraqi president had been warned by virtually
all his erstwhile friends _ Russia, France, China and the Arab
nations _ that he would take the blame for bringing down American
missiles on his country and people. Even governments that oppose
the use of force to settle this crisis had made it clear that the
Iraqis were isolated in their defiance this time and could not
count on them for help.
</P>
<P>
   The present crisis with Iraq, which came on the heels of a year
of confrontations, has its roots in a decision by Saddam on Aug. 5
to curtail cooperation with inspectors from Unscom, which monitors
biological, chemical and prohibited missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   They and their counterparts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which watched nuclear developments, were forbidden to make
new on-site searches and were restricted to using existing
monitoring systems _ cameras and air, soil and water samplers _ and
making routine inspection visits to previously agreed sites. That
move set off alarms here for the short as well as long term,
because the Security Council had intended the inspection system to
keep functioning, with unannounced searches, even after sanctions
were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, the council responded with a resolution that
ended all further sanctions reviews, and therefore hopes of having
the embargo lifted, until weapons inspections resumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Security Council and the secretary-general
were working on plans for a comprehensive review of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations, going back to the 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, when sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also made demands about how the review should be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, the council laid out its plans for conducting a
review. It did not promise more than a new look at sanctions after
Iraq had met all its disarmament requirements. The next day, Saddam
surprised everyone involved by shutting down the inspection system
entirely. In the face of possible American bombing, all the
inspectors have now been withdrawn from Iraq.

<P>
   They had waited two years and nine days for justice, two years
and nine days for answers, and now they would have to wait another
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th floor courtroom that had been set aside for the
sentencing of Eduardo Granados was too small to accommodate the
crowd gathered in the hallway. Moving to a larger room would delay
the hearing for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Levey had tried to warn courthouse officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told then we'd have a lot of people coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Dan's father and mother were there, Fred and
Eleanor Levey. And his sister, Robin Balon. There were friends and
relatives and a couple of television crews. And Dan's
sister-in-law, Sheri, who answered the door to her home two years
and nine days ago, and heard a police officer say, ``Your husband
has been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In her purse, Sheri Levey carried a letter she had faxed to
Judge Michael McVey. ``I don't know if I'll be able to read this in
court or not,'' she said, handing it to me. It read it part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good met evil in the early morning hours of Nov. 3, 1996. My
husband of 10 years, Howard, left the house in the morning to play
basketball with his buddies, as he had most every Sunday for many
years. I know the scenario. He was reading the sports section of
the newspaper and listening to the radio. Sounds innocent enough.
But not this morning.'' &QL; 
OUT OF THE DARKNESS
</P>
<P>
   It was dark. Forty-year-old Howard Levey probably didn't see
Jorge Hernandez, now 19, or Eduardo Granados, 24, until they
knocked on his window, or shattered it with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   He was parked in his Mercury Sable at Clarendon Elementary
School in Phoenix, near the basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   Granados and Hernandez decided they wanted the Sable. They shot
Howard Levey. Dragged him out. Shot him again. Left him. The car
was found a few blocks away, where they'd abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Levey's family was to receive justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez already had been sentenced to 15 years in prison. On
this day, Granados would get 25.
</P>
<P>
   But not before he heard from Howard's mother and father, his
sister, his brother, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was moved to the fourth floor of the Maricopa County
court building, into a room with the soft lighting and hard pews of
a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The Levey family, unaccustomed to the protocol of a courtroom,
first sat behind the defendant's table. They shifted hurriedly to
the other side, like passengers in a listing ship, just before
Granados was led in by a deputy. &QL; 
Vacant eyes
</P>
<P>
   He looked older than 24, and walked with a bounce, as if to the
rhythm of the noisy chains that bound him. He stared at the crowd
with vacant eyes, acknowledging only his mother, who sat alone, and
his two lawyers. Granados stood before the judge and admitted to
first-degree murder. He had nothing else to say.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Levey told the judge Howard was ``everything a father could
want in a son.'' Eleanor, barely able to hold back her sobs, said
there were ``no words to describe the pain and suffering this event
has caused my family.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was correct. There aren't.
</P>
<P>
   I met Dan Levey not long after his brother Howard _ the father
of two children _ was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Dan was searching for the killers then, and for answers. And he
was looking out for Howard. On this day, he brought with him all
the rest of his brother's keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The killer was there, too, but with no explanations written on
his blank face. Nothing that would ease the pain of Levey's family
or help them make sense of what had happened.
</P>

Adams picks Titans to replace Oilers nickname in '99
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Tennessee Oilers' most important game of the
season, owner Bud Adams announced in Nashville that the team's new
nickname in 1999 will be Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which hosts Pittsburgh in a crucial AFC Central game
at Vanderbilt Stadium today, will have a new logo and uniforms that
will be unveiled to the public in December. Adams wants to keep
red, white and blue as his colors.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' team, which played its first 37 years in Houston, has
been the Oilers since he helped Kansas City owner Lamar Hunt found
the American Football League in 1959. The name change coincides
with the team moving into its new 67,000-seat stadium adjacent to
downtown Nashville next year.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who reluctantly agreed to change the name after
commissioner Paul Tagliabue guaranteed him no other NFL team would
ever be known as Oilers, did not have Titans as his first choice,
according to league sources.
</P>
<P>
   Adams preferred Pioneers over Titans, the sources said. When
information leaked in Tennessee that he was favoring Pioneers, he
switched to Titans. Titans was the original nickname of the New
York Jets when the AFL was founded. Jets owner Leon Hess had to
agree to let Adams use Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a new nickname to reflect strength, leadership and
other heroic qualities and to be equal to, if not better, than
great NFL nicknames like Vikings, Giants, Buccaneers and Cowboys,''
Adams said Saturday during a news conference at the new stadium
that is still under construction. ``A Titan these days is someone
who excels and stands out in his work. He or she is recognized for
greatness or special achievement. That's what we want for our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans comes from early Greek mythology, and the fact that
Nashville is known as the Athens of the South makes the Titans name
very appropriate. If we continue to play like Titans, we'll be in
the playoffs this January.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers won the first two AFL championships, reached the AFC
Championship Game two times in the Luva Ya Blue era and made the
playoffs seven consecutive years in the run-and-shoot era. They are
5-4 entering today's game against the 6-3 Steelers at a sold-out
41,000-seat Vanderbilt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers haven't made the playoffs since 1993, when they were
the last AFC Central team to sweep the Steelers. The Oilers won at
Pittsburgh two weeks ago 41-31.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was supposed to disclose the new nickname during
ceremonies at the last regular-season game, against the Minnesota
Vikings. He became worried that the media would find out before
that Dec. 26 game and moved up the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Adams named the team Oilers in honor of his late father, Boots,
an oilman who helped found Phillips 66. Adams wanted to keep Oilers
as the nickname, but Tennessee fans, media and politicians demanded
that he select a new one.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory council representing the state of Tennessee was
formed to make recommendations to Adams. There were 39 candidates
that were selected based on research. The final choice was made by
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to trim the list,'' Adams said. ``Titans was
always a strong contender in my mind. Pioneers and Tornadoes also
were popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many fans told me they wanted a larger-than-life figure like a
Giant or Viking rather than an animal. One of the strong
recommendations the advisory council made was no snakes or
reptiles. That eliminated Copperheads and Vipers. My apologies to
the herpetologists.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Properties is designing logos and uniforms from which Adams
will choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Tennessee fans, I want to say thank you for your input
and patience throughout this process,'' Adams said. ``Dozens of
fans contacted me directly. Hundreds were involved in the early
focus groups and thousands submitted names during our contest in
October. Our fans have been involved and invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   At his new stadium, Adams plans to have a museum honoring his
team during the 39 years they were known as the Oilers.

SHARK SHOOTOUT TOO CLOSE TO CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ How hot was the team of Davis Love III and Brad
Faxon in Saturday's best-ball phase of the Franklin Templeton Shark
Shootout?
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: In a format requiring each two-man team to use
only the best of its two scores on each hole, Faxon/Love wound up
throwing out an !ital!eagle.!off!
</P>
<P>
   So it went for the newest leaders in this annual
what-have-you-done-lately event at Sherwood Country Club, where a
19-under par once finished last.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon and Love, starting the day three strokes off the pace,
combined for a 10-under-par 62 to get to 14-under, one stroke ahead
of five other teams going into today's closing round of scramble
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really ding-donged it well today,'' Faxon said after his
team punched out eight birdies and an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle, coming on No.2, was a sort of double eagle as Faxon
tapped in for an unnecessary 3 on the 531-yard par-5 hole after
teammate Love had eagled from out of a greenside bunker.
</P>
<P>
   They wound up with the only eagles of the day, but there were
birdies enough (97) to alert the Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite and Billy Mayfair, who started the day four strokes off
the lead, rolled in seven consecutive birdies in a round of 62 that
left them tied for second at 131.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament host Greg Norman and Steve Elkington combined to
birdie their final four holes while shooting 64 and also shared
second place, along with Billy Andrade/Jay Haas (who birdied eight
straight on the back nine en route to a 62), Constantino
Rocca/Scott Hoch (65) and first-round leaders Fuzzy Zoeller and
John Daly (66).
</P>
<P>
   All of them were chasing Team Love/Faxon, which went 4-under
during the first three holes, then birdied five straight during a
mid-round spurt.
</P>
<P>
   They called it teamwork all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched while Davis went birdie-eagle-birdie, and that got
us going,'' said Faxon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I watched for a while,'' echoed Love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up and down,'' Love said. ``I played a few good holes,
and then Brad played a few good holes. It's a good score, and we're
going into a better format (today).''
</P>
<P>
   That's the brutal reality of this three-round event, where
scores get better each day with successively friendlier formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past (first-round) alternate stroke, I think
everybody enjoys the last two,'' said Love.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon looks for a big charge today, especially with just one
stroke separating the top six teams and three other teams close
enough to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobsen and John Cook are at 134, four strokes off the
lead and tied with Fred Couples/Justin Leonard and defending
champions Bruce Lietzke and Scott McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the top nine teams can win, according to Faxon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a big swing on the last day if two guys get
going,'' he said. ``Anybody out here can shoot low.''
</P>
<P>
   Include Kite in that prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The former Ryder Cup captain, who won at Sherwood in 1992 and
'96, combined with Jay Haas to shoot 16-under par in last year's
scramble round.
</P>
<P>
   He was on a roll again Saturday, teaming with Shark Shootout
rookie Mayfair for birdies on holes 9 through 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putter's back. I'm putting very well now, feeling very
confident,'' said Kite, who said he had been struggling on the
greens the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The cure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of stumbled onto something and I'm feeling very secure
now.''
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with his history at Sherwood, could make Kite's
team the one to watch in today's scramble.

AZ BIBLE WEEK DRAWS FIRE FROM ACLU, RELIGIOUS GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gov. Jane Hull found herself in the lion's den
Saturday as some religious leaders branded her Bible Week
proclamation an affront to their faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Civil Liberties Union said it would decide this
weekend whether to sue the state as it joined a Jewish rabbi and
Buddhist minister in calling on Hull to rescind the decree. Other
religious leaders likened it to a form of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally inappropriate,'' said Rabbi Robert Kravitz of the
American Jewish Committee. ``In the synagogue, we study the Torah
all the time. In churches, they celebrate the New Testament
frequently. . . . We don't need the government to suggest a certain
week to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz demanded that Hull take back the proclamation she issued
for Arizona to recognize Bible Week on Nov. 22-29. So did the Rev.
Lee Rosenthal, senior priest at the Arizona Buddhist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking against it, it almost makes you anti-Christian Bible,
which is a shame because it is a beautiful text and a wonderful
foundation,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But discovering that should be the result of someone's own
spiritual seeking, not by proclamation of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Pattea, president of the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache
Indian Community, said he also is against the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Pattea said American settlers following Judeo-Christian
principles ended up massacring scores of his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came and disrupted our way of life. As traditional
people, we don't rely on (the Bible) at all,'' Pattea said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull signed the proclamation on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the annual rite of controversy in Gilbert, which
has passed a Bible Week decree for the past four years. This year,
the ACLU announced it would seek court action to stop the Bible
Week declaration, which is expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Eisenberg, ACLU director, said she will ask for a
meeting with Hull to explain the constitutional issues and ask that
she rescind the Bible Week proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as disappointed in the governor as we are in the mayor
of Gilbert,'' Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, simply declaring Bible Week . . . offends the
Constitution. The government is simply not supposed to entangle
itself with religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the state cannot sidestep the issue by saying it
would decree weeks recognizing other religious books, such as
Islam's Koran and Judaism's Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of being neutral among religions, but
neutral on the subject of religion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was in Mexico and could not be reached for comment
Saturday, her spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issuing this proclamation is more or less a routine process,''
Francie Noyes said. ``We didn't mean it to be controversial or
confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull did find some supporters for her proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly commend Gov. Hull,'' said Bonni Roll of Phoenix.
``But I'm a Bible believer, so I think we can take some of our
concepts and make America greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bill Mellinger of Friendship Community Church in
Scottsdale said the Bible is an important book in this nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put aside a week for that. I don't think there's
anything wrong with that,'' he said. ``I would not want to push to
say that anybody has to be Christian, or any religion, (but) let's
recognize the value of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said Hull proclaimed Bible Week at the request of the
National Bible Association, a New York-based group that has
celebrated the week since 1941, according to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said the state is planning no activities or photo
opportunities for Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are going to listen to what people have to say
and kind of re-examine the issue,'' shesaid.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation's wording was provided by the National Bible
Association.
</P>
<P>
   It calls the Bible ``the foundational document of the
Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was conceived.''
It says the Bible ``continues to provide inspiration, hope and
comfort for many Americans,'' and that Bible Week, ``has helped
strengthen spiritual understanding . . . by encouraging personal
reading and study of the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Eppinger, executive director of the Arizona Ecumenical
Council, a coalition of 700 Christian churches in Arizona, said he
would like to see the week celebrate other holy books as well as
the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its wonderful to have a Bible Week because the Bible
has been such a part of our heritage, but we are a pluralistic
society now, with Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, each one of which has
their own sacred scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that next year Hull proclaim a ``Holy Writings''
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have people from every faith put special emphasis on their
faith and learn from their own scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iman Sabahudin Ceman of the Islamic Center of North Phoenix,
said he supports Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is recognized in the world as one of the books of
the Gods,'' he said. ``I don't think anybody who reads that book
can get any harm. It's recommendable to any person to read one of
those books that are recognized as religious books.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceman said he understands that it could be recognized as a
political issue, but he didn't see it as a religious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a reason why you belong to that religion,'' he said.
``Nobody else can put their religion above that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kennard, a Buddhist minister from Calm Village Temple in
Phoenix, said he is not offended by Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with there being a Bible Week, but I
don't think we should exclude others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said such governmental decrees might have the effect of
making non-Christians feel isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being American does not mean that one is a Christian,'' he
said. ``I think we're mixing patriotism and personal belief.'' &QL;

KANSAS STATE ENDS 30 YEARS OF FRUSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ The Little Program That Could finally did.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State had waited 30 years to beat Nebraska. Its program
had waited forever for a victory of national significance. And even
though the game's end was delayed twice by fans starting to storm
the field, the wait is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, overcoming mistakes and mystique, defeated
Nebraska, 40-30, yesterday. The victory clinched the Big 12 North
Division title and kept Kansas State in the national championship
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy; I can assure you of that,'' Kansas State coach Bill
Snyder said after a long pause. ``I did smile after the game,
contrary to popular belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Michael Bishop, 45-1 as a collegiate quarterback, had 446
yards of Kansas State's 512 yards total offense. He ran for two
touchdowns and threw for two more, including the game winner with
5:25 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, who also lost three of five fumbles, was not made
available for questions after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the mainstay for us today,'' Snyder said. ``He's a
great quarterback, so competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, ranked second nationally by The Associated Press
and third in the Bowl Championship Series list, needed every ounce
of Bishop's desire as Nebraska turned the game into a pendulum of
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   With a 14-7 lead in the second quarter, the Cornhuskers, ranked
11th by AP, had a first-and-goal at the 4. Kansas State's defense
held for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the play of the game,'' Kansas State defensive
coordinator Mike Stoops said. ``To hold them to three, it helped
settle us down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bishop drove the Wildcats 76 yards in seven plays in 57
seconds to make it 17-14 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous move in the right direction,'' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   From its first-and-goal at the four through the third quarter,
Nebraska gained 30 yards on its next 28 plays. ``We were pinned
down pretty good over that stretch,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska forged a 24-all tie going into the fourth quarter when
Ralph Brown returned a Frank Murphy fumble 74 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was painful,'' said Snyder, who abhors turnovers and who
waved his arms in disgust after the play.
</P>
<P>
   After a Martin Gramatica field goal made it 27-24, the
Cornhuskers countered with a 63-yard drive. Quarterback Eric Crouch
(108 yards rushing, 139 yards passing) connected for his third
touchdown pass, this one to tight end Sheldon Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kris Brown missed the extra point, making it 30-27. He
had made 125 in a row, equalling the NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop then capped his performance. The Wildcats went 80 yards
in 10 plays, eight passes and two Bishop runs. The touchdown came
when Bishop scrambled away from pressure, rolled right and found a
wide-open Darnell McDonald with 5:25 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so open, I worried I'd drop it,'' said McDonald, who had
a career-high 12 receptions for 183 yards. ``I was surprised I was
so open, but it happened because Mike had to scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jeff Kelly's return of a Crouch fumble made it 40-30
with three seconds remaining. Twice the fans rushed the field,
thinking the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took awhile,'' senior defensive end Joe Bob Clements said.
``We had to keep kicking the fans off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Kansas State officials quietly installed
``permanent'' goal posts that were supposed to be indestructible.
Finally, after about 30 minutes of trying, the fans finally snapped
off the cross bar.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, like the Kansas State program's turnaround,
required persistence.

FLYERS BEAT DEVILS, 6-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After playing even with the Flyers for the first
two periods on Saturday, the Devils collapsed in the third,
allowing five goals. It was the worst defeat of the season for the
Devils, a 6-1 thrashing at the First Union Center that ended the
Flyers' seven-game streak without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros and John LeClair had two goals each against Martin
Brodeur, while Keith Jones and Rod Brind'Amour also scored for the
Flyers, who took 40 shots against Brodeur, 17 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Sharifijanov scored the only goal for the Devils against
Ron Hextall, who faced just 18 shots and tied Bernie Parent for
career victories with 232. Hextall was simply a spectator in the
third period, facing only two shots. The loss was only the third in
the last 11 games for the Devils (9-6-0), while the victory ended
the Flyers' futility against the Devils at six games and improved
their record to 6-6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek made one major strategic change: instead of
using the usual checking line of center Bob Carpenter with wings
Jay Pandolfo and Brian Rolston against Eric Lindros' line, Ftorek
used center Bobby Holik and wings Sharifijanov and Randy McKay.
</P>
<P>
   The change by Ftorek might have been prompted by the fact that
Lindros' line had a brand new right wing in Keith Jones, who was
acquired from the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday. He made his debut
tonight with Lindros and LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils kept the trio at bay in the first period, but LeClair
opened the scoring just 19 seconds into the second period, when he
collected a rebound of an Eric Desjardins shot, while the Devils
were killing a penalty to Ken Daneyko, and beat Brodeur for his
ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had not allowed a power-play goal in the last 27
penalty-killing situations. They entered the game with the league's
No. 3 penalty-killing unit, and LeClair's goal was only the seventh
power-play goal the Devils had allowed in 60 manpower advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers dominated the first half of the second period and
should have had more than one goal, but the Devils withstood the
Flyers' flurry. They started to play the home team on equal terms
and skated off at the end of the second period tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sharifijanov tied it for the Devils at 9:40 of the second
period, when he took a pass from McKay in the left circle and beat
Hextall over the left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Sharfijanov had a marvelous opportunity to open the scoring
during a 4-on-4 situation late in the first period, but he was
denied by Hextall.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils seemed to lose their composure in the last period,
allowing three goals before the session was 4:13 old. Jones started
the onslaught with his first goal for Philadelphia and his third of
the season, 45 seconds into the period. Lindros scored his fifth,
at 2:54, and Brind'Amour got his seventh. Lindros added his second
goal of the period at 10:11, and LeClair finished the scoring at
16:18.

BISHOP, WILDCATS OVERCOME MISCUES

<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Michael Bishop, Kansas State's senior
quarterback, kept the Wildcats' national-championship hopes alive
yesterday by rubbing out two Nebraska second-half leads. Thanks to
Bishop's 446 yards of total offense, Kansas State beat the Huskers,
40-30.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders how Bishop kept his poise when he fumbled five times
in the first half, losing three. And there is curiosity about how
Bishop twice found wide receiver Darnell McDonald with second-half
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas State coach Bill Snyder has silenced Bishop,
declaring him off limits for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves others to talk about Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reacted differently than he's done in the past,'' Kansas
State offensive coordinator Ron Hudson said. ``He made suggestions
on what we could do on offense. We used some of the patterns he
suggested in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is an emotional player. He was particularly incensed in
the first half when he fumbled at the goal line and was called for
a 15-yard face-mask penalty on a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Bishop is the only quarterback in the history of
college football to have a face-mask penalty called on him during a
run,'' Snyder said. ``On the fumble, Michael said he was giving the
ball to the official after the run, and he called it a fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bishop recovered to lead Kansas State on two
second-half touchdown drives. On the first one, his 17-yard pass to
McDonald gave the Wildcats their first lead, at 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He audibled out of an option play because he saw Nebraska had
us outmanned,'' Hudson said. ``He saw Darnell was one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's game-winning touchdown pass to a wide-open McDonald, an
11-yarder with 5:25 remaining, was made possible when Bishop rolled
right to avoid Nebraska's pass rush. His movement drew the Nebraska
defensive backs away from McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Michael's the type of guy who doesn't let things
phase him,'' Kansas State offensive lineman Jeremy Martin said.
``He showed today how great a player and a leader he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he can't talk about it himself.

GOLFERS WILL SCRAMBLE FOR LOW SCORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ What next for this sharp-shooting Shark Shootout
field, which combined to shoot 90 strokes under par in Saturday's
best-ball format?
</P>
<P>
   If history is any barometer, look for the scores to go much
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday scramble play traditionally brings out the best at the
Shootout, where double-digit scores under par are common and the
final-round record is a ridiculously low 55 on the 7,025-yard,
par-72 Sherwood Country Club layout.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament host Greg Norman and Nick Price set that record in
1993 _ and finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 10-team scramble field shot 113-under par, including
a round of 59 by tournament champions Bruce Lietzke and Scott
McCarron _ who had only the third-best score of that day.
</P>
<P>
   Is any lead safe on Scramble Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says two-time champion Tom Kite, but he thinks scramble
play benefits leaders more than chasers.
</P>
<P>
   It has to do with the free-wheeling nature of the format, where
both team members drive, select the best shot and continue to take
two shots on their best ball the rest of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems in scramble format it would be tough to hold the
lead,'' Kite said. ``But it's really easier to hold the lead. You
need to be clear of the field because it's hard to pick up more
than three or four shots in scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   In nine previous shootouts, scramble play has produced a total
of 29 rounds in the 50s _ including eight of 10 during the
blistering 1995 competition where two teams shot 57 and lost. The
field that year was 135-under par on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   None of this history is lost on shootout rookie Billy Mayfair,
who also gets daily advice from teammate Kite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps telling me to shoot low,'' Mayfair said.
</P>
<P>
   Record crowd: Saturday's attendance of 7,107 was a tournament
record, following a big turnout of 6,632 on Friday. The jump might
relate to tournament officials' decision to sell single-day tickets
this year. In previous Shark Shootouts, fans had to buy a pass for
the entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Peek: Ben Crenshaw, who teamed with Craig Stadler for a
6-under-par 66 to get to 136 (10th) on Saturday, is playing and
looking for a few good men.
</P>
<P>
   As captain for the 1999 Ryder Cup team, Crenshaw is hoping to
put together a U.S. team that can end a two-match winless streak
against the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win it,'' he said.

McDonald gave the Wildcats their first lead, at 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He audibled out of an option play because he saw Nebraska had
us outmanned,'' Hudson said. ``He saw Darnell was one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's game-winning touchdown pass to a wide-open McDonald, an
11-yarder with 5:25 remaining, was made possible when Bishop rolled
right to avoid Nebraska's pass rush. His movement drew the Nebraska
defensive backs away from McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Michael's the type of guy who doesn't let things
phase him,'' Kansas State offensive lineman Jeremy Martin said.
``He showed today how great a player and a leader he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he can't talk about it himself.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because of consistent demands from hunters,
Buckmasters announced the re-designation of RACK magazine as a
bimonthly publication. An annual publication since 1996, RACK will
publish six issues a year, starting in April. While maintaining a
strong focus on trophy whitetail deer, it won't be a how-to
publication like Buckmasters Whitetail magazine but one that
delivers straightforward trophy-hunting adventure with an added
emphasis on all types of big-game hunting. RACK is available by
subscription only, at 800-240-3337.

   Tiffany Bruss caught a 2 1/4-pound shellcracker fishing off the
family dock on Spring Creek at Lake Seminole, according to Jack
Wingate of Jack Wingate's Fishing and Hunting Lodge. She caught the
fish on a Bream Buster in two feet of water. It was 14 1/2 inches
long and two inches thick. ... Ray Beck of Beaumont, Texas, won the
FLW/Wal-Mart Tour Co-Angler-of-the-Year award. Beck had the largest
one-day stringer (20 pounds, 6 ounces) and fish (11-0) in a
tournament last season on Sam Rayburn Reservoir in Texas.

   A WEEKEND GETAWAY
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the third annual Plantation Wildlife Arts Festival
(Saturday and Sunday Oct. 21-22) say their festival in Thomasville
is more than a art sale. Yes, those who attend the festival in the
South Georgia city, located less than an hour west of Valdosta, get
to view and purchase wildlife art and photographs from some of the
nation's most respected artists, but there will be much more,
according to Margo Bindhardt, who chairs the festival. ``The
wildlife art show and sale will be the focal point,'' Bindhardt
said. ``However, we've planned fantastic wildlife demonstrations.
There'll be lots for families to see and do.'' Headlining the
attractions is wildlife expert Jim Fowler, best known for his work
on the ``Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom'' TV show, who will do an
hour-long show on Sunday with such animals as tigers, boa
constrictors and bears. Also scheduled are demonstrations,
lectures, a children-only tent to explore the outdoors and a show
featuring birds of prey. Cost is $6 per day for adults and $3 for
children ages 6-11; it is free for children under 5. For
information, call 800-704-2350.

   PARKS TRAVEL GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   A newly updated travel guide to state parks and historic sites
has just been published by the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources. The 128-page guide describes each site with a photo,
location map and detailed information on overnight accommodations,
facilities, programs and nearby attractions. ``The travel guide
provides the same information available on our Web site, but its
compact size makes it convenient for travelers,'' said DNR
spokesperson Kim Hatcher. ``Many of our visitors keep the guide in
their glove box and find it useful for spontaneous trips and leaf
watching in the mountains.'' With support from Coca-Cola and Mead,
the guide's price has been reduced from $8.75 to $6.95. It is
available at any Georgia state park or historic site, or by calling
404-656-6538.

 &HT;    WMAs get DU funding
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Chapter of Ducks Unlimited recently
presented a check for $113,000 to the state Wildlife Resources
Division for waterfowl management projects throughout Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   To date, DU has contributed $1,145,330 on 27 conservation
projects in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   DU makes an annual donation to WRD as part of the Matching Aid
to Restore State's Habitat, a one-for-one matching funds
partnership between DU and WRD for waterfowl management projects in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   DU money comes from fund-raising projects held around the state
during the year, and members are generous. The money WRD
contributes to MARSH comes from the sale of state duck stamps. In
1997, Georgia waterfowl hunters purchased 35,389 Georgia Waterfowl
Conservation Stamps.
</P>
<P>
   When hunters open their season Saturday, 11,563 prime acres of
Wildlife Management Areas they hunt will be MARSH projects, out of
a total 112,060 MARSH acres in the state. For more information,
call 770-918-6416 or DU at 770-985-5922.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier sailboat regatta
</P>
<P>
   Teams from Lake Lanier's sailing community will race for the
chance to get a $150,000 discount on a new boat in the second
annual Lanier Cup Regatta, sponsored by the University Yacht Club,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The regatta is invitation-only. Each sailing club on Lanier has
the chance to put up four boats, two in each division, with a
possible field of 40. Rather than racing on a long, drawn-out
course _ such as from Brown's Bridge to Buford Dam _ the Lanier Cup
will be run in a smaller area.
</P>
<P>
   The first race starts at 10 a.m., if there's wind. The post-race
party is about 4 p.m., at the University Yacht Club. Admission is
$7 in advance, $10 on race day. For more information, call
770-967-2814.
</P>
<P>
   DNR bans log removal
</P>
<P>
   Citing several concerns, including fish habitat and water
quality, the state Department of Natural Resources has temporarily
banned the removal of sunken logs from state rivers. Because many
of the logs are old-growth longleaf pines _ accidentally sunk in
the 1800s and early 1900s during commercial runs of logs downstream
to coastal ports _ they are believed to have market value,
prompting some people to pull them out. The ban is in effect until
a task force further invesigates the impact of log removal. ``Over
time, mud and other debris have covered many of these logs and
partially imbedded others,'' DNR commissioner Lonice Barrett said.
``Removing them today could adversely impact our waterways and
estuaries that now support many species of fish and
invertebrates.'' For more information, call 770-918-6407.
</P>
<P>
   Little Satilla expansion
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Resources Division has announced a 6,177-acre
expansion of the Little Satilla Wildlife Management Area, bringing
the unit to 25,022 total acres, plus the lease of a parcel close to
Little Satilla called the Rogers Tract. The new land is deep
southeast Coastal Plains habitat about midway between Jesup and
Waycross. It includes hunting opportunities for deer, turkey, small
game and feral hogs. Little Satilla WMA is about eight miles east
of Patterson on Ga. 32.

 &HT;    Under cover, agents call shots for union
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Understand this much about the NBA Players
Association: The super agents are calling the tune.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly defensive and unconvincing in his denials, union chief
Billy Hunter parroted the views of David Falk and Arn Tellem after
meeting with the guys who specialize in big-money players.
</P>
<P>
   The union chief is surrounded by Falk clients, including Michael
Jordan, union president Patrick Ewing and board members Juwan
Howard, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. Hunter makes highly
contradictory calls for fiscal responsibility on the part of owners
while crying out for a free market that will benefit only the rich.
It's basic math that when they get more, the underclass gets less.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that by instituting a ceiling on ``Larry Bird''
players and holding down the percentage of income they pay, the
owners are exercising their own form of fiscal responsibility,
i.e., giving Hunter what he says he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Even if the owners don't apply written
restraints but agree among themselves not to pay away with
$20million salaries, the union will cry collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Other agents, such as Richard Howell and Steve Kauffman, know
what's going on. They must be wincing as Falk calls the tune, to
the point of bragging he had tutored Jordan the night before the
semi-retired player baited 74-year-old Washington owner Abe Pollin
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Deals you will not see
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown or Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard for Latrell
Sprewell: After moving Ike Austin for a guard, Pat Riley will not
trade Brown for another guard. Mashburn and Lenard for Sprewell
could be possible, because Miami would upgrade at the shooting
guard and could survive with Mark Strickland, Dan Majerle and Keith
Askins at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics won't trade Antoine Walker for Brian Grant. Popeye
Jones will do what Grant does for a fraction of the cost. The only
question about Walker is whether owner Paul Gaston will give him a
mega-contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are rumored to be offering Doug Christie and Charles
Oakley as part of a three-way involving San Antonio and Golden
State. The truth: Toronto has no interest in such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone wants to play for the Lakers. Ridiculous. In May,
Malone said he wanted to play in Portland or Seattle because he
needs the soothing sounds of rain for a sound night's sleep. Malone
sounds increasingly like agent Dwight Manley's other client,
rassler Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   In the hunt for a guard
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret the Knicks are unhappy with their point guards.
Starter Charlie Ward is a free agent looking for too much money _
the Raptors care _ and Chris Childs is only expensive trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are interested in Oded Kattash, a 6-4 star in the
Israeli League. Agent Marc Fleisher had him work this summer with
Jayson Williams of the Nets. ``He's got a street game,'' Williams
said. ``Most guys come from overseas and just want to do one thing:
be a straight-up shooter. This guy can play street. He can cross
over; he can go through his legs; he can create his own shot. And
he's a nice kid, a great kid. He doesn't speak English very well,
but he still laughs at my jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Williams, he will stay with the Nets. ``I'm going to
have seven or eight teams coming at me, but what I told New Jersey
was that I'm a guy of loyalty. The Nets stuck with me when I wasn't
doing the right things off the court, and now that they see my life
is in order, they are still staying with me. I realize I have to
give back that loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   A little pocket change
</P>
<P>
   While everyone knew players could miss paychecks when the
lockout started, Anthony Mason did something about it. Mason
reportedly borrowed $900,000 from the Charlotte Hornets before the
lockout started July 1. The loan will be repaid with interest once
the lockout ends. ... By the way, while Vlade Divac is threatening
to return to Europe if the lockout goes into January, fellow
free-agent center Matt Geiger says don't count him out as a
returnee in Charlotte. ``If they want to put a nice contract in
front of me that's market value, I'll consider it,'' Geiger says.
The question is whether coach Dave Cowens wants Geiger after their
spat over his hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers' new team leader, told all his
teammates he would rent the gym at Southwestern College, where they
practice during the season, so they could work out together during
the lockout. Only three _ Derek Fisher, Eddie Jones and Rick Fox _
said yes. And Fox is leaving. ... At the opposite end, 11 Indiana
Pacers players consistently have worked out as a group. Which team
do you think will get off to a quick post-lockout start? ... Danny
Manning has made a much faster than expected recovery from his
third major knee blowout. His doctors implanted a tendon from a
cadaver in Manning's knee, and he already is playing full-court
basketball and could be ready to go by year's end.

 &HT;    3rd-and-shortcoming
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before a midseason practice in 1988, the Indianapolis
Colts' Ron Meyer, one of the most media-friendly coaches in recent
league history, strolled over to the sideline and conferred briefly
with the three newspaper reporters who covered the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, I could probably close this practice (to the media), but
I don't want to do that,'' Meyer said. ``So I'm asking that what
you're going to see out here today _ well, you're not really seeing
it, OK?'' Then Meyer winked at the trio and trotted back to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   What the reporters witnessed that day was an offensive
de-evolution, born more from Meyer's displeasure with his team's
performance in third-and-short situations than from his celebrated
penchant for gimmickry.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Turner, signed earlier that morning, operated the Colts
from a Wishbone offense for nearly half the practice session.
Turner was a roly-poly quarterback from Washington State who had
played two seasons in Canada and never had a nibble from an NFL
team before getting the surprise phone call from Indy personnel
director Jack Bushofsky.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, against the unsuspecting Tampa Bay defense,
Turner entered the game on third-and-1. After faking a belly-play
to fullback George Wonsley, he kept over left tackle for 3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Turner carried 16 times that season, for just 42 yards.
But he converted eight of nine third-and-1 snaps. And he completed
three of four passes, all for first downs, for 92 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the Miami Dolphins practices last week. Jimmy
Johnson, miffed by his offense's inability to convert
third-and-short, began to install an option series operated by
third-string quarterback Todd Doxzon.
</P>
<P>
   The significance: Ten years after Meyer's gambit, NFL coaches
seem willing to try just about anything to remedy their increasing
problems with short-yardage plays. Doxzon, who made the Miami
roster as a backup wideout and ``gunner'' on the punting unit,
suddenly could become a key role player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third-and-short doesn't mean third-and-a-sure-thing anymore,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Through 10 weeks, teams are converting only 57.2 percent of
third-down plays of 3 yards or less. On third-and-1 snaps, the
conversion rate is just 66.9 percent. Both figures are down from
the same point in the 1997 season, and coaches are scrambling to
come up with solutions to their third-and-shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jets coach Bill Parcells went to a bigger backfield,
subbing second-year fullback Jerald Sowell (248 pounds) for
tailback Curtis Martin (203) and pairing him with fullback Keith
Byars (255). The experiment fizzled when Sowells fumbled twice in
three series, but Parcells probably will go back to it again.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells noted that coaches must resort to variety unless they
have a mobile quarterback or a back who is a proven commodity on
third down _ such as Dallas tailback Emmitt Smith, who has
converted third-and-1 runs 11 of 13 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 15 of the 30 teams have passed on more than 50 percent
of their third-and-short plays this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings have faced 38 third-and-short situations
and passed 22 times. Their conversion rate is better through the
air (68.1 percent) than on the ground (65.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mind spreading things out a little (on
third-and-short),'' Vikes offensive coordinator Brian Billick said.
``The field is so reduced in those situations, it's difficult to
get much push on the defense.''

 &HT;    Falcons seeking right mindset to take on 49ers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the Falcons play today, Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves won't rant or rave at his team. He won't try hypnosis. He
doesn't have a huge couch for four dozen men who, some would say,
are in need of psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are sick and tired of losing to the San Francisco
49ers (7-2), who have beaten Atlanta (7-2) five times in a row,
eight of the past 10 and 23 of the past 29 _ often by large
margins.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Falcons are going to achieve the right mindset, they
will have to get there one player at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so many ways to say things, and these guys have
heard it all,'' Reeves said. ``Really, I'm more concerned when
we're playing somebody with a lesser record. I'm not a
psychologist, but the only way I know . . . is to finally step up
and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Ogilvie, a sport psychologist and professor emeritus
at San Jose State University who worked with the 49ers back in the
1960s, would have Reeves believe that in order to succeed one must
pay as much attention to mental methodology as to strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Atlanta has a tremendous advantage, if they care to
play upon it in an intelligent way,'' Ogilvie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, they have nothing to lose. They're the
(three-point) underdog and have been the underdog. If I were going
to have any comment to the team . . . it would be, `We have nothing
to do but climb the mountain, and let it hang out.' I would go on
and on. Many players are self-generating, but for the ones that
need a kick in the (rear), that could be the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie linebacker Keith Brooking has been on both sides. When he
was at East Coweta High School, the school moved from Class AA to
AAAA his sophomore year. The big game was against cross-town rival
Newnan, long a traditional state power. Newnan won the first two
years, East Coweta the third. ``That was huge,'' Brooking said. ``A
lot of it had to do with players' confidence level going in. It was
intimidating for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I just remember our whole student body came together,
there were signs all over the community, we had a better record,
and coach (Danny) Cronic kept convincing us we could win. And I
really went into that game thinking we could win. We all did.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work the way in college, however; Georgia Tech lost to
Georgia all four years Brooking was a Yellow Jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our main problem at Tech,'' he said. ``We went into a
lot of those games against Georgia not believing we could pull it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson said players are lying if they say
they shut out San Francisco's 31-20 win on Sept. 27, in which the
49ers bludgeoned Atlanta 31-7 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like getting beat up by the bully on the block.
You don't forget,'' he said. ``Until you believe in yourself and
have the ability to approach that guy and say, `Stop picking on
me,' nothing changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we beat the 49ers (28-27) when they came to
the Dome in '95, we had an attitude like, `We don't care. We can
beat these guys.' That's the attitude you have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Players go about it in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said all he needs to do is show film of the first 49ers
game to motivate his team. But wide receiver Terance Mathis doesn't
want to see that film.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to forget about what happened last year and forget
about what happened last time,'' Mathis said. ``If you think about
that, we've lost already. We've lost our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith, who played at Tennessee in 1990-91,
arrived when the Vols had lost five games in a row to Alabama. They
also lost both games to the Crimson Tide while he was there, and
the result was paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you would hear at the beginning of the year
was, `Beat Bama!' It was all anybody ever talked about,'' he said.
``And we didn't. It was a big mental thing. Same here for the last
few years. Now, though, the guys I'm playing with have the talent
to whip those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of attitude is a step in the right direction. But for
tight end O.J. Santiago, a slightly different approach works.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Kent (University), we only won five games in my four years,
and I mean teams were just beating the hell out of us,'' he said.
``I learned you . . . have to have faith in your teammates, but . .
. I like to turn it into a personal battle between me and the man
across from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shane Murphy, a Trumbull, Conn., sport psychologist and
author of the book, ``The Achievement Zone,'' said mental imaging
is critical, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have this image of playing well against an
opponent that has played well against you in the past,'' he said,
``or, if you're a high-jumper, clearing the bar when it's set
higher than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say the bar is higher now for the Falcons than it's
been since they won nine games in a row in 1980 to capture their
only division title.
</P>
<P>
   Too much thinking could cause problems, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (players) will be playing the game all night Friday, or
all day Saturday, in their heads,'' said Oglivie, the California
sports psychologist. ``They get involved (too) early. There might
be four or five starters so hyped _ maybe the quarterback will
throw a bunch of balls over receivers' heads, or linemen might jump
offsides.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said, ``I often get calls from athletes the night before
competition. They want to get out there, get involved, start
rocking and rolling. That's when the most doubt creeps in. I've
encountered athletes that have worn themselves out trying to be too
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reeves agrees in part about playing the underdog
role, but generally he leaves it up to players to take care of
their own frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up under Coach (Tom) Landry (with the Dallas Cowboys),
and he never did (give big, emotional speeches),'' Reeves said.
``The fact that we are underdogs takes off some of the pressure of
expectations from others, but not expectations of your own. We
prepare the players to play one game at a time, and I believe they
don't need help (getting psyched up).

 &HT;    Moving early wasn't such a good idea for the Carolina Hurricanes
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Amid an expanding fraternity of professional
sports team owners who move their franchises at the drop of a
checkbook, it won't break the hearts of jilted fans _ particularly
those in Hartford, Conn. _ to learn of the financial carnage here
off I-40.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Hurricanes _ based in Raleigh, playing in
Greensboro and embraced by neither _ are on their way to exceeding
last year's estimated losses of $30 million. Attendance is so poor
at their palatial temporary facility, the 21,000-seat Greensboro
Coliseum, that black canvas now is draped over most of the upper
level to create a cozier atmosphere for the intimate gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   And that's after the Hurricanes committed the seemingly verboten
act of dropping ticket prices this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand the situation,'' Hurricanes forward Keith
Primeau said. ``It's a long way for people to drive from Raleigh.
On weeknights, I don't even allow my own kids to come to games, so
I don't expect people to bring their kids out. You can't get home
12:30, 1 in the morning, then try to get your kids up for school
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have suffered from the same market miscalculation
as the Tennessee Oilers, who played football in a near-empty
stadium in Memphis last season during construction of their
permanent home in Nashville. It was so bad that the Oilers moved
their games to Vanderbilt this season.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro is a minimum 90-minute drive from Raleigh. Residents
in the interim city won't invest time and money in a franchise that
is leaving next season, while those in the long-term town have
better things to do than drive all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Canes averaged 9,108 last season, less than they ever drew
in Hartford before moving south, and that was after papering the
house with freebies. One promotion rewarded four free tickets for
anybody who would test drive a Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What would they think in Montreal?
</P>
<P>
   Management concluded this year that its product was being
devalued, so it vowed not to give away as many tickets, dropped
prices and created several discount packages. Carolina's average
ticket price of $38.15, before special discounts, ranks 21st in the
NHL. The result through eight games has been an average of 6,950
tickets distributed, with in-house attendance even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials maintain confidence in the Raleigh market, but it
might be wise to hold off on projecting sellouts until after they
can gauge the results of a season-ticket campaign that kicks off in
January. There also is an outside chance the Hurricanes will start
next year on an extended road trip if the $156million arena, slowed
by weather problems and funding issues stemming from $22million in
cost overruns, is not completed in time.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. ``There's no reason to come back here (to
Greensboro),'' said general manager Jim Rutherford, cognizant the
team would be forced to pay the Coliseum another $2 million in
rent, even if it played just one game there next season.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford explained the franchise's decision to head south
before construction was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made to come into the market as soon as
possible to educate the people about hockey,'' Rutherford said.
``We didn't know what to expect. We set some goals, like all
businesses. We had higher goals for our attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could've stayed in Hartford for two more years, but how
many people would we have drawn? We may have sold out, or maybe
people would have said, `We're not going to support this team
because they're leaving.'''
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate part is Rutherford has pieced together a
competitive team, one that has spent some time in first place in
the Southeast Division. Primeau, Ron Francis and Gary Roberts make
the Canes respectable at forward, and goalie Arturs Irbe has been
the low-budget free agent find of the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford and coach Paul Maurice have urged players to spend
more time looking for the puck than at empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I think everybody was a little shocked by the
attendance,'' Maurice said. ``I think they're all better prepared
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said, ``We can't let ourselves look back in five
years and think, `Wow, we had a good team back in '98 and '99. We
just didn't put the effort in because nobody came to the games.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that players, who live in the Raleigh area, still don't feel
displaced during their drives to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be difficult, but I didn't know if I expected
it to be this difficult,'' Francis said. ``But we can't use that as
an excuse.

 &HT;    It starts at the top
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It shouldn't be long before Philadelphia owner Ed
Snider starts realizing the common demoninator to the Flyers'
failed seasons. The Flyers have had three coaches in Bobby Clarke's
five seasons as general manager, and Clarke has made a blur of
trades. He pulled another deal late last week, sending forward
Shjon Podein to Colorado for Keith Jones. But it didn't stop the
Flyers from losing to Florida 2-1. Philly, despite a $41.9 million
payroll, started the year 4-0-1 but was 1-6-3 since going into
Saturday's game against New Jersey. And Clarke can't blame this one
on Eric Lindros, who is having a great season and has been
outspoken on the team's poor play. Clarke said, ``I have a boss,
and when you have a boss, you're going to be judged on performance,
just as I have to judge players on their performances. When you're
not winning, you obviously feel the responsibility for it, but
everybody does.'' Trade rumors continue to swirl around forward
Alexander Daigle and others, but how many shakeups can one team
survive?
</P>
<P>
   Shuffle again, Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   Don Audette, one of the league's remaining high-profile unsigned
restricted free agents, wants out of Buffalo. Audette went public
with his demand late last week after seven months of negotiations
for a deal broke down. Audette, who led the Sabres with 24 goals
last year, would accept the Sabres' three-year offer totaling $5.7
million, except that the last two seasons are not guaranteed. The
deal is structured much like an NFL contract, with three annual
base salaries at the option of the club, and the last two years
comprise $4.5 million of the contract. ``I've compromised enough,''
Audette said.Briefly
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the Hockey News reports Toronto's Pat Quinn
is the NHL's highest-paid coach at $1.1 million and Calgary's Brian
Sutter the lowest at $278,885. ... Quinn on parity in the NHL:
``With parity, everybody figures their team should win. Maybe
that's why coaches get fired so easily.'' ... Jacques Demers' job
as Tampa Bay general manager just got more difficult. Owner Art
Williams had allowed since-fired GM Phil Esposito to raise the
team's payroll by $5 million to $26.5 million. But it's just now
being discovered that the Lightning's payroll exceeds $30 million.
And nobody played worthy of their salary during that 10-2 loss to
the New York Rangers. ... The Rangers are losing patience with
Niklas Sundstrom, who has only four points in 14 games and a
team-low plus-minus rating of minus-8. The Rangers had been
averaging only 1.5 goals per game until scoring 16 in the next two
against Florida and Tampa Bay. ... Montreal's Mark Recchi has moved
into seventh on the all-time ironman list with 558 straight games
going into Edmonton Saturday night. The NHL record is 964 by Doug
Jarvis.

CAPITALS BEAT ISLANDERS, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The fans came back to Nassau Coliseum Saturday
night, but the team they came to see never showed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of the largest home crowd this season, the
Islanders bombed. They looked nothing like the team that has
recently flirted with first place in the Atlantic Division.
Instead, they looked like the Islanders of old, losing by 5-3 to
the Capitals in front of a boisterous crowd of 14,538.
</P>
<P>
   One game after dominating the Montreal Canadiens at home, the
Islanders couldn't get anything going against the struggling
Capitals. Even goalie Tommy Salo had a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders scored first and led, 1-0, briefly in the first
period, but the Capitals took over, scoring four straight goals,
three coming in the second period, to take a commanding 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have been a tough game for the Islanders. Once
again, the Capitals (5-7-3) are beset by injuries. Saturday night,
the defending Eastern Conference champions played without Sergei
Gonchar (knee), Steve Konowalchuk (ankle), Michal Pivonka
(shoulder), Steve Malgunas (hip), Jaroslav Svejkovsky (ankle) and
Richard Zednik (shoulder). The long list of injuries _ which
actually is not quite as long as it was last week _ has contributed
to the team's slow start. The Capitals are in last place in the
Southeast Division, behind the woeful Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   As if the injuries weren't enough, the Capitals' goalie has also
struggled this season. After leading the Capitals to the Stanley
Cup finals last season, Olaf Kolzig had a meager 3-7-1 record and
an .898 save percentage entering Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders were badly out-played in the game's first 20
minutes, getting outshot by 15-6. The score was 1-1 when the period
ended, thanks to Salo's superb play in goal. The goals were scored
by Kenny Jonsson of the Islanders at 7 minutes 19 seconds and Ken
Klee of the Capitals at 16:48.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Washington got three straight goals _ from
Andrei Nikolishin, James Black and Brian Bellows _ to stretch its
lead to 4-1. A shell-shocked Salo was pulled after Bellows' goal,
which may have been stoppable, and was replaced by Wade Flaherty at
14:29.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain, scored on a power play at
17:50 of the second period, cutting his team's deficit to 4-2. It
was Linden's team-best seventh goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Oates scored at 13:30 of the third period to give the
Capitals a 5-2 lead with 6:30 remaining. Linden scored again at
16:52, but by then it was too late.

 &HT;    Thrashers continue to look for practice facility
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers continue to hold conversations with as many as
four parties for proposed construction of a practice facility.
Former Atlanta Flames owner Tom Cousins, a major real-estate
developer in the area; two rink development groups, Mentmore in New
York and Loridan in Toronto; and John Bardis, owner of The Cooler
in Alpharetta, remain possibilities. Cousins owns several acres of
property in the northern suburbs. Bardis would be willing to give
the Thrashers ice time but does not want to pay for construction of
a training facility. He also continues to deny speculation that he
is seeking to sell the facility, although he said he would listen
to offers. The Thrashers do not want to manage their own ice rink
and are trying to persuade someoneto build one for them. Thrashers
vice president Dave Maggard reiterated that the team might rent ice
time next year, probably at The Cooler, if a deal for a permanent
facility can't be worked out soon. ``We don't have a deadline,''
Maggard said. ... General magager Don Waddell might want to file
away this quote from Los Angeles Kings goalie Manny Legace, who has
been starting since Jamie Storr and Stephane Fiset were sidelined
with groin injuries. ``Next year, I'm a free agent,'' Legace said.
``Expansion's coming. Hopefully, someone will take notice.''
Existing NHL teams are allowed to protect only one or two goalies
for the expansion draft, depending on how many forwards and
defensemen they protect.
</P>
<P>
   TWO MINUTES WITH: BILL GUERIN
</P>
<P>
   _ Team: Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Position: Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Age, hometown: 28, Wilbraham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Scored 10 goals in first 13 games to lead the league.
Has never scored more than 29 in a season with New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the difference between playing in the Western and Eastern
conferences: ``The East has a lot of tight checking. The West is a
lot of run-and-gun hockey. It's night and day. The Oilers play a
pretty aggressive offensive system, and it enables all of us to
open it up.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On travel problems playing in Edmonton: ``I went from one of
the easiest cities to play in to probably the most difficult. At
times, it does take its toll. In New Jersey, we could have a game
in Washington, and I could still be home and sleeping in my own bed
at 12:30 or 1 in the morning. Here, we go to the East Coast and
we're easily gone for seven or eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Oilers' financial problems: ``The guys still like
playing here. Once the season is up and going, you can't
concentrate on the team's financial situation because you have to
worry about playing hockey. But I guess it's always in the back of
your head. We lost (free-agent goalie) Curtis Joseph because we
couldn't afford to keep him. We don't charter every flight because
we can't afford it. But there's a lot of tradition playing in
Edmonton, and we like it.''

 &HT;    Black (and blue) hawks
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is little doubt casualties will result from
Chicago's anemic play this season. The question is, what happens
first? A firing or a trade? Blackhawks coach Dirk Graham is
believed to have set an NHL record by using the word ``disgrace''
to describe his players' performance two games in a row. But Graham
is catching heat himself from fans and management, and there are
rumors he and assistant coach Denis Savard are not getting along.
Graham denies he's in trouble, saying, ``I don't get fired by
anchor people or reporters. The only people I answer to are my
bosses.'' Savard admits he and Graham have had their differences,
yet adds, ``I'm opinionated on certain stuff, but I don't think
it's any different than what goes on anywhere else.'' Things can't
get worse after Thursday's 10-3 home loss to Toronto, which
stretched the Hawks' winless streak to eight games. They have been
outscored 20-6 in the first period during the skid. Goalie Jeff
Hackett (3.79 goals-against average) is allowing a goal and a half
more per game than last season and defenseman Paul Coffey has yet
to play because of back and neck pain. Graham called his players
``a disgrace to the uniform'' after the Leafs' game, this two days
after he felt the Hawks were physically intimidated by St. Louis
and said, ``Some of our guys are content to finish the game. They
don't want to be physical, don't want to stick their noses in
there. That's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The puck stops here
</P>
<P>
   If creative billboards depicting Amy Grant and Garth Brooks with
blacked-out front teeth have helped sell hockey to Nashville,
goalie Mike Dunham has helped sell the Predators to the rest of the
NHL. No goalie has had a more diffcult job this season than Dunham.
He is facing an average of 34.5 shots per game, highest in the NHL,
yet is 6-5-1 through his first 12 starts with a 2.49 goals-against
average and a .928 saves percentage. In the process, he has
reaffirmed that a starting goalie is an expansion team's most
important acquisition. The Predators took Dunham in the expansion
draft when he was left unprotected by New Jersey. The presence of
Martin Brodeur limited Dunham to only 41 appearances in the last
two years with the Devils. ``I learned a lot in New Jersey, but I
had to be patient,'' Dunham said. ``I was just hoping, with the
expansion teams coming, that I'd get my chance sooner or later.''
As to playing behind Brodeur, he added, ``I watched the way Martin
handled himself on and off the ice. Staying relaxed away from the
rink has helped my concentration in the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The protracted holdout of Pavel Bure is affecting attendance in
Vancouver. Only 13,906, an all-time low in GM Place, watched a game
against Los Angeles, and it came on the heels of the Canucks'
claims that the franchise lost $21.6 million last year.

 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Aaron Sago used to think that fly fishing was a
fruitless endeavor, and he thought he had proof.
</P>
<P>
   Often times when he fished a river, he'd see a fly fisherman
nearby, and he seldom saw them catch anything. He'd be out there
chucking out a big fat worm or even a kernel of corn with his
spinning rod and reel and was convinced he could catch more trout.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed three years ago for the 28-year-old man when he
thought it would be interesting to cast a fly. ``Now I'll never go
back,'' he says. ``I think a fly fisherman can outfish a spin
fisherman anyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago is also about the time Sago, a Marietta resident
who specializes in the Internet, took his passion to the World Wide
Web and started what has become one of the more popular
Georgia-based pages.
</P>
<P>
   North Georgia Trout Online attracts more than 4,000 hits a week
from fly-fishing enthusiasts, and more than 3 million have visited
since February 1997, when the hits started getting counted. Now the
site has led to a new one _ georgia-outdoors.com _ that Sago hopes
will become the site to visit if you want to do something outdoors
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started this (in November 1995), the World Wide
Web was the World Wide What?'' said Sago, who operates his
``basically nonprofit'' site out of a tiny office in his home. ``We
went one page at a time, and it kept growing and growing and
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sago's site offers stream reviews and reports, event
listings and a message board that has more than 1,200 active
participants. The still-developing site, which is about six months
old, has lake fishing reports and a pretty good hunting area.
</P>
<P>
   Sago's sites are just a sliver of the outdoors sites available
on the Web, as more cyber-savvy enthusiasts get outdoors via the
Internet. According to a study by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers
Association, as many as 50 million Americans are frequent
participants in outdoors sports. In 1996, according to the report,
12.4 million went fishing in all its forms at least 25 days, 3.7
million went shotgun/rifle hunting at least 25 days and 10.7
million went camping at least 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   And many of these outdoors people go online to get information,
line up trips and even chat about the best way to work a
Texas-rigged crawdad through a stump field. There's plenty to find,
too, from the sites of such popular magazines as Field &AMP; Stream
(www.fieldandstream.com) and special-interest organizations such as
Trout Unlimited (www.tu.org) to local attractions, such as North
Georgia Internet Magazine (www.georgiamagazine.com) and Lake Sidney

of a comprehensive look at the area.

   ``It's uncanny how many people are interested (in bass
fishing),'' says Southern Fishing Schools' Ken Sturdivant, who does
Georgia reservoir fishing reports for a few Web sites. ``People are
thirsty for knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   With all of the online information, there a generous share of
useless, especially outdated, data. ``If it's a week old, it's too
old,'' Sturdivant says.

<P>
   Still, a cruise on the Web can be well-worth the effort, and
with continuing advances, such as broad-band technology, the future
promises even more. Sago's site will soon have photos of the
Chattahoochee River at Holcomb Bridge near Norcross updated every
30 seconds or so, as well as a virtual trout stream in which a user
can fish online. Eventually, an entire hunting or fishing trip can
be booked at one site. ``We are on like a 2 on a scale from 1 to
10,'' says Web site developer Shirley Mixon, who runs the Lake
Lanier site, among others. ``We ain't seen nothing yet.

CARDINALS WINNING GAMES, GAINING ON COWBOYS IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cowboy'' Jim Williams of Ahwatukee is a true-blue Dallas
Cowboys fan and has been for more than 30 years. But his 5-year-old
daughter, Alexa, doesn't want to watch the 'Boys on television.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy's little girl is a Cardinals fan!
</P>
<P>
   Manny Luna, assistant manager of a Sports Authority store in
Mesa, doesn't have enough Jake Plummer or Eric Swann jerseys to
keep pace with the demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad Jack'' Corson, a Cardinals fan who can be found today over
the ``Armageddon'' banner above the players' entrance at Sun Devil
Stadium, was so intent on seeing red when the Cardinals play host
to the Cowboys in an NFC East showdown that he bought 40 seats
around him in the north end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Corson sold the tickets to Cardinals-loving friends and invited
them to a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it just to keep Cowboys fans out of the stands,'' Corson
said. ``I'm having a huge tailgate party for 70 people, all you can
eat and drink, right next to the baseball field.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what gives here?
</P>
<P>
   Have the Cardinals, now in their 11th year in Arizona, finally
begun to capture the community's imagination?
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, has this become a Cardinals town?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's a little early to declare Cardinalmania.
</P>
<P>
   Home attendance still ranks near the bottom of the NFL. Sunday's
game is the first to sell out fast enough to avoid a local
television blackout since 1995, when a Christmas Day game against
the Cowboys did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of the fans, maybe a majority of them, will be wearing
Dallas colors Sunday when the Cowboys and Cardinals battle for _
dare we say this? _ first place in their division.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals may be on the verge of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona always has been a Cowboys stronghold, and there are
myriad theories as to why. Some fans just like to jump aboard a
winner's bandwagon, and the Cowboys have a winning tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's the result of the many years before the
Cardinals came to town that the Cowboys were televised virtually
every week on CBS, so much so that the network was jokingly known
as the Cowboys Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Converted Cardinals fan Richard Abalos said some, like himself,
adopted the Cowboys as kids because they are Arizona State fans and
followed a long line of Sun Devils who went on to star for the
Cowboys, including quarterback Danny White, linebacker Bob Breunig,
defensive end Jim Jeffcoat and now safety Darren Woodson _ whom
Abalos coached in Pop Warner football.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are deeply rooted in the rest of the state, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the ``Arizona Daily Star'' regards the Cowboys as
``Tucson's Team'' after a readership survey ranked them as the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals finished fourth,'' Sports Editor B.J. Bartlett
said. ``The Cowboys won handily. I'm a native, and it's always been
a Cowboys town as far back as I can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff physician Mickey Abeshaus isn't sold on the home team
yet, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Cardinals have been here a decade, it will
take at least a generation of new fans growing up with the team in
order to replace all the Cowboys fans who have lived here all their
lives,'' Abeshaus said in a call to ``The Republic's'' PressLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, by the time the new generation grows up, the
Cardinals will have likely moved on to greener pastures, and we can
go back to rooting for the Cowboys without all this controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the Cardinals are on the winning side of the ledger
for a change, and a victory Sunday against the Cowboys could fuel
an even greater groundswell of support.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 130 e-mails received by ``The Republic'' in
response to the question ``Is this a Cardinals town or a Cowboys
town?'' about 75 percent responded in favor of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The same ratio held true for 66 callers to ``The Arizona
Republic's'' PressLine through Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But merchandise is often the best measure of a team's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a huge increase in requests for Cardinals
merchandise,'' said Luna, the sporting goods store manager.
``People call and ask, `Do you have Plummer jerseys? Do you have
Swann jerseys?' The pennants, decals and stuff like that are doing
pretty well, too. I just wish we had more inventory to satisfy the
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gilbert, district manager for JCPenney, said his company
has seen about a 30 percent rise in sales of Cardinals merchandise
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they win Sunday, things are really going to start
jumping,'' Gilbert said. ``Even if they don't beat the Cowboys, if
they win a couple more games after that, it will start popping.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna said that, at many his company's stores, most of the
requests are coming from kids.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be better news for the Cardinals, who have been
trying for years to build grass-roots support. Kids are growing up
with a team and finally have a reason to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a great rise in our Cardinals Kids Club,'' said Joe
Castor, director of marketing for the team. ``The Kids Club targets
that exact philosophy, and it has doubled from 2,500 members last
year to 5,000 this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 5-year-old Alexa Williams will be signing up soon and
donning some of Cardinals merchandise, if she can convince her
Cowboys-loving dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that liberated,'' Jim Williams said, laughing. ``When
you're growing up, you kind of have a rivalry with your dad. She's
only 5, but she's a Cardinals fan. When the games are on TV, the
first thing she does is ask if the Cardinals are on, or if it's the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her, `No, the Cardinals are at home, so it's blacked
out.' So we watch the Cowboys game. But I have DirecTV, and if
they're out of town, I'll switch it back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alexa, it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cardinals have been in a similar position before:
a big game, full stadium, a city and state ready to embrace the
hometown heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a bigger game for the community than it is for
us,'' quarterback Jake Plummer said. ``This has been like a second
home field for the Cowboys, but last year when we beat them, there
were a lot of people in the stands wearing Emmitt Smith or Troy
Aikman jerseys who were screaming for us at the end. It was kind of
weird to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make this a full-out Cardinals town.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game might be the club's best opportunity yet to win
over fans like Ray Gonzales, who phoned ``The Arizona Republic's''
PressLine.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said he's a Dallas fan first, a Cardinals fan second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals are my second team. Go Big Red,'' said Gonzales,
who not surprisingly predicted a 50-50 split of red and blue fans
at Sunday's game. ``Dallas is America's Team, so you have to go
with the flow. Let's hope the Big Red can pull one out again this
year, but I don't see it. Go Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   So which is it going to be?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there are a lot of split loyalties in the Valley's
melting pot. Chicago, Denver, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Oakland
also have drawn throngs of their fans to the Cardinals field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each victory we have is a meaningful step toward community fan
support,'' said Michael Bidwill, the team's vice president and
general counsel. ``This weekend, we've got another great
opportunity. This community has waited for this team to play
consistently and beat teams like the Cowboys. If we can do that, it
would be a great thing for the city and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a game for first place against a top division
opponent. The town's fired up, and so are we.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Preying for NFC West top spot
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question bears asking because, seriously, it's
darned near impossible to believe this is happening. The Falcons
(7-2) playing the 49ers (7-2) today _ in the middle of November,
for Pete's sake! _ for sole possession of first place in the NFC
West? In a sold out Georgia Dome? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   So is this live, or Memorex?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it can't be a replay. In 1980, when the Falcons won their
only division title in 32 mostly futile seasons, even the 49ers
were lousy. Steve DeBerg was young, and he was San Francisco's
quarterback, at least for nine starts. Then, some guy named Montana
took over.
</P>
<P>
   Young is San Francisco's quarterback now, as in Steve. And he
says Atlanta is for real. If the Falcons' 41-10 win last week at
New England wasn't proof enough that Atlanta is better than the
average team in a watered-down NFL, consider the testimony of a man
fresh from film study.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've filled their roster with guys who have a tremendous
passion for football,'' Young said. ``They're making progress. I
see a down-after-down intensity that a lot of teams don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have made progress. They are ranked No. 9 in overall
offense, have scored 31 points or more in five of the past six
games, have won 13 of 17, and eight of nine in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   But the one division loss was Sept. 27, at San Francisco, when a
31-20 score didn't tell how badly the Falcons were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has won five straight against Atlanta, and 11 of
13.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mental block that can't be denied. So the Falcons
aren't denying it. They're trying instead to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can walk into a locker room and smell defeat,''
said running back Jamal Anderson, who has rushed for more than 100
yards in six of his past seven games. ``Everybody has to believe,
and we do now. We've been waiting to show we're better than last
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have sputtered of late, falling behind by at least 16
points in three of their past four games. Their pass defense is
suspect. They make more mistakes than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves knows his team failed miserably in its
first chance against the division bully.
</P>
<P>
   But with the first sellout of the Dome in three seasons, he's
looking forward to another try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if intimidation is the word, but we've got to
match their intensity,'' he said. ``They accepted the challenge
when we were both 2-0, and they didn't want to lose first place and
that's the way champions are.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way the Falcons need to be to take the next step.

PARENTING PROGRAMS FEW AT ARIZONA PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of Arizona children are being orphaned by a prison
system that is putting more and more mothers behind bars without
offering programs that help preserve the fragile bonds with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocates say the results could be devastating for the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that children with parents in prison are likely to
be truant, have substance-abuse problems and get involved in other
criminal behavior. They also are more apt to join gangs or get
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they have little supervision. And kids who wind up in
foster care because their parents are in prison often are bounced
from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   With odds like that, Cynthia Seymour, researcher with the Child
Welfare League of America, a non-profit advocacy group, says, these
children are likely to end up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The state's population of women in prison has more than doubled
during the past decade, to 1,677 in 1998 from 689 in 1988. And an
estimated 70 percent to 80 percent of female inmates are mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering stats are even more daunting when coupled with a
severe lack of such programs that many experts say can preserve the
fraying bond between children and inmate mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Formal parenting classes are offered at only one of the state's
nine prisons, and the lone state program that allowed children to
spend time with their mothers behind bars was shut down in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are visits always relaxing reunions. They are often stilted
and carefully watched by corrections officers, and telephone calls
are kept short.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades _ as the number of female inmates
skyrocketed _ prison programs have sprung up nationwide, including
ones that put children behind bars with their mothers for an
afternoon, weekend or even years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little movement in Arizona to start similar
programs, mostly because there is so little money, says Rep. Susan
Gerard, R-north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, formal parenting classes are available only at the
Arizona Center for Women, a minimum-security prison in Phoenix,
offered through Rio Salado Community College and paid for by the
Corrections Department.
</P>
<P>
   As part of those classes, women can spend Friday afternoons with
their children in a playroom, practicing what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   Programs in other states often are run by non-profit groups at
little or no expense to the state, and federal grants for such
programs have become available in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   States such as California, Nebraska and New York have programs
that allow inmates to live full-time with their children _ some up
until the age of 6. California has six such facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even with plenty of money on hand, Arizona lawmakers likely
would be divided about offering such an approach, Gerard says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, these people are supposed to be being punished,
and part of that punishment is being isolated from your family and
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That the parent is in prison should raise questions about
whether she should be reunited with her children, particularly when
many of the crimes are drug-related, Gerard says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think families should understand that if you screw up, you
lose your kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gerard says, some lawmakers would contend that it is not
the role of government but of religious groups and non-profit
agencies to provide such help.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says Rep. Tom Smith, R-east Phoenix, 93
percent of the state's prisoners eventually are released. He says
Arizona should have more prison parenting programs, in addition to
alcohol rehabilitation and vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that if our prisoners are not better people
when they come out than when they went in, we have not done our
job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Arizona's nine prison complexes don't have formal
parenting programs, although a religious group offers informal
instruction at one facility and two Arizona State University
professors teach a class at another.
</P>
<P>
   A program that allowed children to spend time with their mothers
behind bars, also offered at the Arizona Center for Women, was shut
down because of liability concerns that a child could be hurt at
the prison, Department of Corrections spokesman Michael Arra says.
</P>
<P>
   And Deputy Warden D.K. Branom expressed dismay at having kids at
the Arizona Center for Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what I need,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that program _ Mother-Offspring Life Development _
kids stayed with their mothers in one of two kitchenette apartments
for eight to 72 hours. Inmates earned that privilege by taking
parenting classes and keeping their records clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really the only chance I had to be their mother _ to
cook for them, to read to them, to tuck them into bed at night,
even if only for a short time,'' said Roberta Andros, who was at
the prison for seven years on drug and fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept us going. It kept us together.''
</P>
<P>
   But programs that put children in prison with their mothers are
controversial, especially among those who maintain that losing
children is part of an inmate's punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 1.5 million children have parents in jail or
prison, or 145,000 mothers and 1.38 million fathers, according to
the Child Welfare League.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women in prison is on the rise because of far more
stringent sentencing laws and tougher punishment for drug
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Most women inmates are charged with non-violent crimes, usually
related to methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of women inmates are sentenced to fewer than 10
years, and although they usually retain legal custody of their
children during that time, some rarely see them.
</P>
<P>
   A study of women in Southern California prisons in the late
1980s showed that 61 percent had not seen their children at all
since they were incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisons allow inmates to hug their kids only once when they
arrive and once when they leave. In some facilities, children are
not allowed to sit on Mom's lap.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Correctional Institution for Women publishes a booklet
called ``Remember That I Love You.'' It helps mothers explain to
children where they are and why, prepare them for visits and
reassure them that they are loved.
</P>
<P>
   But a pamphlet can't replace a mother's words or touch,
Kopperman says, adding that the walls of prison put up walls
between mothers and their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're going to kill everyone who goes into the prison
system, they are going to get out, and they are going to go home to
their children,'' Kopperman said. &QL;

VISITING DAYS IN PRISON MEAN THE MOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's early Saturday morning at the Arizona Center for Women, a
minimum-security prison in Phoenix, and a 5-year-old boy pulls up
his shirt and turns out the pockets of his denim shorts.
</P>
<P>
   He's been coming here for two years and knows the drill.
</P>
<P>
   Press the black buzzer outside, sign in and then go through one
heavy metal door that clanks shut before the next heavy metal door
opens.
</P>
<P>
   The boy walks through the metal detector ahead of his
grandmother and greets the corrections officer standing there. She
smiles at him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's here to see his mother.
</P>
<P>
   She's been here as long as he can remember. It's been a month
since he's seen her, and _ spotting her across the prison yard _ he
runs to her, his arms outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've missed you so much,'' she says into his hair.
</P>
<P>
   The prison yard at 32nd and Van Buren streets is full of
children during weekend visitations.
</P>
<P>
   In a grassy area, a 7-year-old boy plays tag with his inmate
mother. His laughter bounces off the drab cement walls ringed with
barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the Arizona Center for Women, one of five state prisons
that house women, do the mothers have a shot at maintaining even a
semblance of a normal relationship with their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the deputy warden who runs the prison must favor such
programs. It was in the mid-1980s that Mary Vermeer, then deputy
warden of the Arizona Center for Women, pushed for the program.
</P>
<P>
   So, the minimum-security inmates take parenting classes. One
class includes a laboratory, allowing the mothers to try out what
they are learning during Friday afternoon sessions with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the program received the Model Program Award of the
American Association for Women in Community Colleges, a national
honor. Its director, Jo Jorgenson, was invited to talk about the
classes at the North American Conference on Family and Corrections
in Bethesda, Md., in September.
</P>
<P>
   The classes are tough. Attendance is mandatory. And there's lots
of homework.
</P>
<P>
   But the inmates say they will come out of prison better parents
than when they went in.
</P>
<P>
   In class, the inmates talk with their teacher, Barbara Rieska, a
part-time faculty member and therapist, about how a parent who has
been in prison can re-establish her authority, impose rules and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder if you have the right to tell them right from wrong
when you're in prison,'' said one inmate, who has a daughter, 11,
and two sons, ages 13 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The women wear jeans and blue T-shirts, the mandated uniforms of
the prison. Most of the women are here because of drug-related
crimes _ dealing, theft, prostitution, fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But, right now, they are mothers, talking about why it is so
much harder to communicate with adolescents than younger children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of them, they're sober. They're off drugs, and it
hits them that they don't get to go home at night to their babies,
to kiss them good night,'' Jorgenson said. ``Kept from their
children, their children become so important to them. They really
want to make some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all inmates take the offered classes. Of the 442 women
there, an average of 25 women sign up every semester for each of
the 10 classes offered. Many women take more than one class.
</P>
<P>
   Some inmates don't have any interest. Others never see their
kids.
</P>
<P>
   But the inmates in these classes struggle to stay in their
children's lives. They send them letters, and call as often as they
are allowed, sometimes daily and sometimes once a week depending on
what privileges their behavior has earned them.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, they check the mail every day, hoping for a crayoned
drawing, note or even a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Not living with her 13-year-old son is the worst part of prison,
one inmate says, her voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   He was as tall as her shoulder when she went in. Now, at
5-feet-10, he is 5 inches taller than she is and has kissed a girl
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   From her cell, another inmate planned her son's seventh birthday
party, writing out invitations and making a list for her husband of
what decorations to buy and where to get the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did those things when I was home. I wasn't about to stop,''
she said. ``It's bad enough that I can't tuck him in at night. I
won't give up anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees her son every weekend and talks to him every night. And
until she gets out, possibly in January, she's taking parenting
classes, one after another.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a folder of letters and pictures her boy has sent her.
She writes to him, printing so he can read the letters himself.
</P>
<P>
   She has explained her time in prison to her son as a ``grown-up
timeout.'' Almost four years ago, she was sentenced to 10 years for
manslaughter. She has assured her son that she will never leave him
again.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she lives for the weekend visits from the
7-year-old who has the same clear blue eyes as his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He scoots his chair closer to hers and holds her hand on the way
to the soda machine. In the prison yard, they play tag, along with
her husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I've missed out,'' the 33-year-old woman said.
``I've missed out on so much.'' &QL;

BRADY'S PLAY LEADS NORTHRIDGE TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Southwest Missouri State was held to a field
goal, which was a herculean defensive stand in this case.
</P>
<P>
   After being run over and passed over for much of the afternoon,
Cal State Northridge's defense forced Travis Brawner to kick a
40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed after that was a CSUN touchdown, and
quarterback Marcus Brady was allotted 6 minutes, 40 seconds to
accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   He made it with 3:32 to spare, connecting with wide receiver
Aaron Arnold for 22 yards as No. 24 CSUN beat the Bears 42-38
Saturday in a nonconference tilt at Plaster Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was, but I was out there having fun,''
Brady said. ``I was able to see their defense real good. It seemed
like I completed every pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping CSUN (7-3) heading toward the playoffs, Brady had a
mind-numbing day. The redshirt freshman figured into all six of
CSUN's touchdowns. He completed a career-high 34 of 40 for 466
yards, the third-best total in school history, and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Brady also caught a 4-yard scoring pass from Anthony Ramos on a
throw-back play in the fourth quarter and ran one in from 3 yards
out in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite the thing to witness on the sideline,'' said CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano, in his 14th year of coaching. ``That's as good
a quarterback performance as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady had scoring passes of 2 yards to Ramos, 11 to running back
Jaumal Bradley and 22 and 69 yards to Arnold as CSUN racked up a
season-high 532 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the final 22 were the ones that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   With CSUN trailing 38-35 and 6:40 left, the Matadors took over
on their own 33. Bradley picked up 20 yards on a screen and a
4-yard pass to Eric Carpenter moved the ball to the Bears 39. But
on third down Matadors center Julio Alcala tried a quick-snap as
the Bears jumped, but no penalty was called. It set up a
fourth-and-4, on which Brady hit Ramos on a 6-yard slant.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Arnold beat defensive backs Mike Gailey and
Cory Blunt on a post pattern as CSUN took a 42-38 lead with 3:32
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought (the win) was getting away,'' Bradley said.
``When our defense held them to a field goal, at that point I knew
that we had them. Our defense gave up a lot of points, but that was
a big stand. It was a big, huge series.''
</P>
<P>
   The win moves the Matadors possibly within a win of their first
Division I-AA playoff appearance, and cream puff Idaho State is on
deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors entered the day in first place in the Big Sky but
share the top spot with Montana State and Montana. Both won
Saturday, but they meet at Montana next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Montana State wins, it would grab the conference's automatic
bid. If Montana and CSUN win, the Matadors get the automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   However, a win by the Matadors should be enough for a playoff
berth. Since 1986, at least two Big Sky teams reached the
postseason each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win makes a statement to whomever does the playoff
seedings,'' said Arnold, who caught five passes for 154 yards.
``They know how we fare against this type of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   So good, and so composed, was Brady that his career effort
overshadowed a near-equal outing by Southwest Missouri State
running back Maurice Daniels. He paced a Bears (5-5) offense that
piled up 459 yards with 248 yards on the ground, though he didn't
score. That was left up to quarterback Derek Jensen, who had an
unspectacular day despite throwing four touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   After moving the ball seemingly at will much of the game, the
Bears stalled on their final two drives.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 35-35, six straight runs by the Bears put
the ball on CSUN's 12. A holding penalty pushed the ball back to
the 25 before Jensen scrambled for 2 yards and threw incomplete on
third down. Brawner kicked a 40-yard field goal to give the Bears a
38-35 lead before the Matadors took over on their own 33 and
embarked on the game-winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri had time to counter and drove to CSUN's 45
with one minute to play. But Brennen Swanson sacked Jensen on
second down and Shawnbay Jones did the same a play later. With 30
seconds left and Southwest Missouri State facing a fourth-and-9,
Jensen's pass to an open Chance Thurman fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times does this happen in the season?'' CSUN safety
Jeremy Golden said. ``It seems like every time our defense knows we
have to do it, we do it. That's not good, but it is good. Defense
wins games in the end.''

ALL HIS BROTHER'S KEEPERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  They had waited two years and nine
days for justice, two years and nine days for answers, and now they
would have to wait another hour.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10th floor courtroom that had been set aside for the
sentencing of Eduardo Granados was too small to accommodate the
crowd gathered in the hallway. Moving to a larger room would delay
the hearing for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Levey had tried to warn court house officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told then we'd have a lot of people coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Dan's father and mother were there, Fred and
Eleanor Levey. And his sister, Robin Balon. There were friends and
relatives and a couple of television crews. And Dan's
sister-in-law, Sheri, who an swered the door to her home two years
and nine days ago, and heard a police officer say, ``Your husband
has been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In her purse, Sheri Levey carried a letter she had faxed to
Judge Mi chael McVey. ``I don't know if I'll be able to read this
in court or not,'' she said, handing it to me. It read it part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good met evil in the early morning hours of Nov. 3, 1996. My
husband of 10 years, Howard, left the house in the morning to play
basketball with his buddies, as he had most every Sunday for many
years. I know the scenario. He was reading the sports section of
the newspaper and listening to the radio. Sounds inno cent enough.
But not this morning.'' OUT OF THE DARKNESS
</P>
<P>
   It was dark. Forty-year-old Howard Levey probably didn't see
Jorge Hernandez, now 19, or Eduardo Granados, 24, until they
knocked on his window, or shattered it with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   He was parked in his Mercury Sable at Clarendon Elementary
School in Phoenix, near the basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   Granados and Hernandez decided they wanted the Sable. They shot
Howard Levey. Dragged him out. Shot him again. Left him. The car
was found a few blocks away, where they'd abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Levey's family was to receive justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez already had been sen tenced to 15 years in prison. On
this day, Granados would get 25.
</P>
<P>
   But not before he heard from Howard's mother and father, his
sister, his brother, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was moved to the fourth floor of the Maricopa County
court building, into a room with the soft lighting and hard pews of
a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The Levey family, unaccustomed to the protocol of a courtroom,
first sat behind the defendant's table. They shifted hurriedly to
the other side, like passengers in a listing ship, just before
Granados was led in by a deputy. Vacant eyes
</P>
<P>
   He looked older than 24, and walked with a bounce, as if to the
rhythm of the noisy chains that bound him. He stared at the crowd
with vacant eyes, acknowledging only his mother, who sat alone, and
his two lawyers. Granados stood before the judge and admitted to
first-degree murder. He had nothing else to say.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Levey told the judge Howard was ``everything a father could
want in a son.'' Eleanor, barely able to hold back her sobs, said
there were ``no words to describe the pain and suffering this event
has caused my family.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was correct. There aren't.
</P>
<P>
   I met Dan Levey not long after his brother Howard _ the father
of two children _ was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Dan was searching for the killers then, and for answers. And he
was looking out for Howard. On this day, he brought with him all
the rest of his brother's keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The killer was there, too, but with no explanations written on
his blank face. Nothing that would ease the pain of Levey's family
or help them make sense of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   In journalism schools, instructors used to tell students that a
good newspaper story answers five ques tions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a good newspaper story.
</P>
<P>
   1) Who? Howard Levey.
</P>
<P>
   2) What? Murdered.
</P>
<P>
   3) When? Nov. 3, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   4) Where? 13th Avenue and Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   5) Why?
