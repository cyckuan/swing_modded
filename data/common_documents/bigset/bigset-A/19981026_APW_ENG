 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Buffalo, Carolina game.

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Olindo Mare kicked four field goals, including a
43-yarder with 10:24 left in overtime, as Miami beat New England
12-9 Sunday in a showdown of AFC East co-leaders.
	   The Patriots had won the four previous games against Miami,
including three last season, but the Dolphins turned the tables
without scoring a touchdown. Miami (5-2) took over sole possession
in the division, and the injury-plagued Patriots (4-3) slipped to
second with their second consecutive defeat.
	   Dan Marino moved Miami 52 yards in the final two minutes of
regulation to set up Mare's game-tying 25-yard field goal. In
overtime, a pass interference penalty on Ty Law on third-and-10
allowed Miami to keep possession deep in its own territory, and
Marino's completions of 25 and 10 yards set up Mare's game-winner.
 &UR; Jets 28, Falcons 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin rushed for more
than 100 yards for the fourth straight game, Vinny Testaverde threw
for two TDs and Anthony Pleasant led a stingy defense as the New
York Jets beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-3 Sunday.
	   Jerome Henderson went 53 yards with a fumble return and Keith
Byars had a 22-yard TD reception for the Jets (4-3), who shut down
the Falcons and their 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg.
	   Atlanta (5-2) was held to 55 yards on the ground, including 46
by leading NFC rusher Jamal Anderson. DeBerg went 9-for-17 for 117
yards and an interception in just under three quarters.
 &UR; Packers 28, Ravens 10 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre broke out of his three-week
funk by throwing for two touchdowns and running for one, Roell
Preston got his third TD return of the season and LeRoy Butler was
turned loose on the blitz as the Packers beat the Baltimore Ravens.
	   The Packers, who lost back-to-back games after their first 4-0
start in 32 years, won for the first time since Sept. 27.
	   The Ravens (2-5), who extended their skid to 13 quarters without
an offensive touchdown, lost their third straight behind bungling
quarterbacks Eric Zeier and Jim Harbaugh.
 &UR; Vikings 34, Lions 13 &QC; 
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown
passes and the Minnesota Vikings scored 17 consecutive points in
the third quarter to remain undefeated.
	   Robert Smith rushed for 134 yards on 19 carries, including a
57-yard touchdown to clinch it for the Vikings (7-0), who defeated
Detroit (2-5) for the second time this season.
	   Lions rookie Charlie Batch, who made his NFL debut at Minnesota
in the third game of the season, was 20-of-37 for 231 yards with
one TD pass and one interception. But Detroit was hurt by sloppy
play, which resulted in 14 penalties for 169 yards.
 &UR; 49ers 28, Rams 10 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Steve Young threw three touchdown passes and
Darnell Walker had two first-half interceptions that led to scores
as the San Francisco 49ers beat the St. Louis Rams for the 16th
straight time.
	   Jerry Rice set an NFL record by catching a pass in 184
consecutive games, Terrell Owens scored twice and the 49ers (6-1)
sacked Tony Banks eight times.
	   Rice broke the mark for consecutive games with a catch set by
Art Monk from 1980-95 and became the first receiver to top 17,000
career yards, finishing with four catches for 64 yards.
 &UR; Saints 9, Buccaneers 3 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Doug Brien kicked three field goals, including a
50-yarder, to help the New Orleans Saints snap their three-game
losing streak.
	   Both teams were inept on offense, with Tampa Bay getting just 11
first downs and New Orleans 12. Each team was 4-for-16 on
third-down conversions.
	   The Saints (4-3), ranked 23rd in the NFL in offense, gained only
266 yards. The Buccaneers (3-4) continued their streak of not
scoring a first-half offensive touchdown this season.
 &UR; Raiders 27, Bengals 10 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Donald Hollas, who hadn't thrown a
touchdown pass in six years, threw two and Napoleon Kaufman rushed
for 143 yards as Oakland won its fourth straight.
	   Hollas, making his second start in place of injured Jeff George,
threw a 19-yard TD pass to Tim Brown and a 39-yarder to James Jett
against his former team. Hollas finished 9-of-21 for 173 yards,
while Kaufman had a career-high 31 carries.
	   Lance Johnstone returned a fumble 40 yards for another touchdown
and Greg Davis added two field goals for the Raiders (5-2). Two
fumbles by the Bengals (2-5) led to Oakland touchdowns.
 &UR; Seahawks 27, Chargers 20 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Joey Galloway scored on an 81-yard reception and a
74-yard punt return in the first half, then came up with a
controversial catch in the fourth quarter that set up Ricky
Watters' 1-yard touchdown run.
	   San Diego cut the lead on John Carney's 45-yard field goal, and
rookie Ryan Leaf moved the Chargers from their 20 to the Seahawks'
3 in the final 2:43 before throwing three straight incompletions in
the end zone to end the game.
	   Leaf had his best game as a pro, completing 25 of 52 passes for
281 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks (4-3), coming off their bye
week, snapped a three-game losing streak. The loss dropped the
Chargers to 3-5 and interim head coach June Jones to 1-1 since he
replaced the fired Kevin Gilbride on Oct. 13.
 &UR; Bears 23, Oilers 20 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Jeff Jaeger kicked a game-winning field
goal for the second straight week, a 33-yarder with 1:03 left that
lifted the Chicago Bears over the Tennessee Oilers.
	   The Oilers (3-4) had a final chance to send the game into
overtime when they moved the ball to the Chicago 38 in the final
minute. But Chicago (3-5) got a sack and forced Steve McNair to
spike the ball.
	   McNair then connected with Willie Davis for a 13-yard gain to
the 32, and the Oilers tried a 49-yard field goal in the closing
seconds. But Craig Hentrich's low kick missed, and the Oilers also
were penalized for 12 men on the field.
 &UR; Broncos 37, Jaguars 24 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Jason Elam kicked a record-tying, 63-yard field goal
and Terrell Davis became the third player to reach 1,000 yards
rushing in seven games as Denver improved to 7-0 for the first time
in its history.
	   Elam's kick at the end of the first half tied the NFL record for
longest field goal set by New Orleans' Tom Dempsey in 1970.
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, finished with 136 yards to
reach 1,001 for the season. He joins Jim Brown (1958) and O.J.
Simpson (1973 and 1975) as the only players to reach the 1,000-yard
mark in seven games.
	   John Elway completed 21 of 35 passes for 295 yards and a
touchdown for the Broncos. Jacksonville's Mark Brunell was 28-of-46
for 353 yards and three touchdowns, but he was sacked seven times.
 &UR; Bills 30, Panthers 14 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Doug Flutie completed 18 of 22
passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns to lead Buffalo over
winless Carolina.
	   Flutie, whose last-minute touchdown run helped Buffalo knock off
undefeated Jacksonville last week, guided the Bills (4-3) to their
fourth consecutive victory.
	   The Panthers (0-7) lost their ninth consecutive game and sixth
in a row at Ericsson Stadium.

Reported child abuse increasing in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reports of child abuse in Japan last year soared
fivefold from seven years ago, partly because greater awareness
about the problem has encouraged more honest reporting, a
government official said Monday.
	   Reports of child abuse received in 174 children's welfare
centers nationwide rose from 1,101 in 1990 to 5,352 in 1997, said
Health Ministry official Kazuo Ohta.
	   The ministry believes the climb was caused by changing social
attitudes that have helped encourage reports of child abuse from
family members and others.
	   Every year, a tally of reported child abuse must be reported to
local governments, which give the findings to the ministry.
	   ``There may be even more cases that go undetected,'' Ohta said.
	   One case that ended in a 6-year-old boy's death in Saitama
Prefecture, or state, just north of Tokyo, was detailed by the
Mainichi Daily News in its Monday editions.
	   The parents, who were convicted in August on fatal negligence
charges, buried their son in the snow in a parking lot after the
boy refused to stay in his bath until he counted to 300, the report
said.
	   The parents were apparently so oblivious to the child's
suffering, they even took a photograph of him shivering in the
snow, the report said. After bringing him in, the father further
abused the child, pinching his body with laundry clips, it said.
The boy died of shock two days later. Bruises covered his body.
	   The report noted the system had failed to detect the abuse
quickly enough. A nurse in the area had called City Hall after she
saw the boy with a black eye and graying hair, wandering alone in a
supermarket, but no action was taken, the Mainichi said.
	   Children's rights are still a relatively new concept in Japan.
In the past, parents were viewed as possessing absolute power over
their children, and the government had little leverage in
protecting a child from abusive parents.
	   The Health Ministry said another contributing factor to the
alarming rise in child abuse is that mothers are under more stress
in Japan's increasingly isolated, smaller nuclear families.
	   Last year, violence made up about half of the reported abuse
cases, and about a third came from neglect, including failing to
feed the children or to give them needed medical care, it said.
Psychological abuse made up 9 percent of the cases while sexual
abuse made up 6 percent.
	   In one out of five cases, the abuse was so serious children had
to be separated from that parent, either by placing them in
institutions or relatives' homes.
	   But last year, the ministry sent out an order reminding local
governments that seriously abused children need protection.
	   Cases of the government protecting seriously abused children
from their parents, even when the parents objected, totaled 36 last
year, about double the previous year, the ministry said.

U.N. team investigates claims uranium mine threatens park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A high-level United Nations delegation
on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine
claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique
cultural and environmental values.
	   An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will
visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to
interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy
Resources of Australia Ltd..
	   The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan,
in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a
list of endangered world heritage sites.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. kms) of
pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-km)
sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many
that are rare or endangered.
	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously
for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings,
rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
	   The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed
for both its environmental and cultural values. Thousands of
tourists visit the park every year.
	   ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its
Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it
already operates inside the park. The company says its good
environmental record at the existing Ranger mine shows the Jabiluka
project poses no threat.
	   Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region
claim it will cause environmental damage.
	   U.N. team leader Prof. Francesco Francioni said its findings
will not be binding on the Australian government, even if the team
considers the park is under threat.
	   However, he said governments can be embarrassed into protecting
sites listed by the bureau as endangered.
	   ``The continuing value of Kakadu National Park is something that
concerns the whole world, the whole of humanity and therefore
justifies such interest,'' Francioni said.
	   Two parks are currently on the endangered list _ Yellowstone in
the United States and the Galapagos Islands.

Governments warned on Olympic gouging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A leading tourism spokesman has warned
that the industry would be hurt if Australian governments gouged
Olympic Games visitors with increased taxes.
	   Tourism Task Force (TTF) chief executive officer Chris Brown
said the federal government's plan to introduce a goods and
services tax in time to slug Games visitors and the New South Wales
government's bed tax showed they were leading the way in gouging.
	   Brown said it was ``kind of obscene that governments are the
first ones to start price-gouging the Olympics.''
	   ``It's just not appropriate that the Olympic Games be a cash cow
for the treasury,'' Brown said Monday.
	   The TTF is the national lobby group representing larger
interests in the tourism, tourism transport and leisure
communities.
	   The federal government was reelected earlier this month on a
platform of tax reform, including a GST. Treasurer Peter Costello
has set July 1, 2000 as the launch date and said he wanted Olympic
visitors to share Australia's tax burden.
	   The International Olympic Committee and the Sydney Organizing
Committee (SOCOG) is concerned that the GST would cause an Olympic
budget blowout of up to Aust dlrs 200 million (U.S. dlrs 126
million).
	   The IOC and SOCOG met with new Sports Minister Jackie Kelly on
the weekend with all parties saying they were confident a solution
could be found.
	   Brown said he wanted an exemption for Olympic visitors so that
more would come and they would spend more money on tourism.
	   ``While I fully support the views of the NSW government and
SOCOG that there should be no GST applied to the Olympic Games, I
go a little bit further and say there should be no GST applying to
the people coming in to see the Olympic Games, to generate jobs,
generate exports and help the economy,'' Brown said.

All Blacks put on notice by Hart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Embattled New Zealand rugby coach
John Hart put several of his front-line players on notice Monday
when he named a 42-man squad to prepare for next year's
internationals, including the World Cup.
	   Hart survived serious pressure on his position to secure a new
contract, as the All Blacks wallow in their worst-ever losing
slump.
	   New Zealand has lost its past five games _ three to Australia
and two to South Africa _ and Hart warned his players that they
needed to show good form in the Super 12 competition early next
year to stay in national team contention.
	   His comments were apparently aimed at experienced players such
as lock Robin Brooke, prop Craig Dowd, halfback Justin Marshall and
fly-halves Andrew Mehrtens and Carlos Spencer.
	   ``There were a number of players whose form tapered off quite
sharply at the end of the season and they will clearly need to show
a sharp reversal of form in the Super 12 if they are going to be
seen longer term in an All Blacks jersey next year,'' Hart said.
	   ``And I'm sure there will be players who will emerge as Royce
Willis did in 1998 and Tana Umaga did in 1997. There will be
obviously opportunities for others to come through.''
	   Hart said the first All Blacks squad would not be picked until
May and the World Cup 26 would not be selected until near the end
of the tri-nations series.
	   He said the squad was not World Cup orientated, but that
tournament late in 1999 remains the major focus for all rugby
nations.
	   ``We have six tests before then and our World Cup squad won't
take shape until the end of the tri-nations at the end of August,''
Hart said. ``We're also looking to the needs of the final 26 so
utility factors are important and a number of players in the backs
and forwards have been chosen for that.''
	   Five of this season's All Blacks _ Todd Blackadder, Ofisa
Tonu'u, Michael Jones, Norman Berryman and Mark Carter _ failed to
make the squad while rugby league converts, and former All Blacks,
Craig Innes and Marc Ellis were included after switching back to
the code.
	   All Blacks squad:
	   Backs: Christian Cullen, Adrian Cashmore, Jeff Wilson, Jonah
Lomu, Bruce Reihana, Tana Umaga, Joeli Vidiri, Daryl Gibson, Caleb
Ralph, Marc Ellis, Jeremy Stanley, Scott McLeod, Alama Ieremia,
Craig Innes, Eroni Clarke, Mark Mayerhofler, Walter Little, Carlos
Spencer, Andrew Mehrtens, Tony Brown, Justin Marshall, Mark
Robinson, Rhys Duggan.
	   Forwards: Isitola Maka, Filo Tiatia, Xavier Rush, Taine Randell,
Josh Kronfeld, Scott Robertson, Aaron Hopa, Reuben Thorne, Charles
Riechelmann, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Royce Willis, Norm Maxwell,
Olo Brown, Craig Dowd, Carl Hoeft, Kees Meeuws, Anton Oliver, Mark
Hammett.

Report: Indonesian mobs attack police car holding suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs went on a rampage after police
refused to turn over a suspect in a wave of mysterious attacks that
have left more than 150 people dead, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   On Saturday, angry residents in the town of Pasuruan on the main
island of Java tried to seize a mentally ill homeless man who was
being held in a police car.
	   Police fired warning shots to fend off the stone-throwing crowd,
which damaged the car, some shops and several cash machines, the
Media Indonesia newspaper said. Two people were injured and four
were arrested.
	   The rioters believed the man, Ahmad Sulaiman, had taken part in
a killing spree on eastern Java in which some of those who died
were Muslim clerics accused of sorcery.
	   Vigilante groups have roamed the streets of Pasuruan, 750
kilometers (470 miles) east of Jakarta, and other towns in their
search for the assailants. They have often targeted mentally ill
people, who have become the scapegoats for the terror.
	   About 330 people have been arrested and 22 people convicted in
mob attacks have been sentenced to five years in jail.
	   Rumors are rife in other Indonesian towns that the violence may
spread outside eastern Java, although there were no indications
that the systematic violence is taking hold elsewhere.
	   Last week, villagers in the central Java town of Demak stabbed
to death three people who were hunting snakes in a rice field. The
mob reportedly became suspicious when the victims could not explain
why they were collecting snakes.

Schools closed in eastern Siberia because of teachers' strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Classes were canceled in 31 schools in the eastern
Siberian region of Chita on Monday when teachers went on strike to
demand overdue wages, a news agency reported.
	   Teachers in six districts in Chita have not been paid their full
salaries since February, ITAR-Tass said. They have received only a
payment of between eight and 50 rubles each (about 5 cents to dlrs
3.12), it said.
	   Overall, the teachers are owed 111 million rubles (dlrs 6.93
million), said Nina Okuneva, local head of the Education and
Science Workers' Union.
	   Millions of workers and pensioners across Russia are owed months
of wages, pensions and other benefits.

Japanese official says king supports summit meeting inside Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Expressing renewed interest in
leading a summit intended to break his nation's political deadlock,
King Norodom Sihanouk has urged opposition leaders to return from
abroad and attend a meeting in Cambodia, a Japanese foreign
ministry official said Monday.
	   Less than two weeks after abandoning hopes that he could
influence Cambodia's three parties to reach a compromise on the
formation of the next government, Sihanouk is now ``strongly
interested'' in presiding over a summit, Japanese State Secretary
for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura said.
	   Following a Sunday meeting with the aging monarch, Machimura
said Sihanouk was now open to the ruling party's desires for the
summit to be held inside Cambodia and for talks to be limited to
Cambodian leader Hun Sen and senior opposition party leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
	   ``Unfortunately, one or two of the party leaders are now outside
of town,'' Machimura told reporters at the opening of a land mine
awareness conference, referring to Ranariddh and junior opposition
party leader Sam Rainsy.
	   ``The king wanted to convey his wishes to Prince Ranariddh, and
possibly Sam Rainsy, to return to the country soon,'' Machimura
said.
	   Claiming that threats of arrest from Hun Sen made negotiations
inside Cambodia impossible, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy led a slow
exodus of opposition lawmakers to Bangkok after parliament was
opened last month.
	   Hun Sen's party narrowly won a majority in a July election, but
needs the opposition's cooperation to gain the two-thirds vote in
parliament required to approve the next government.
	   The ruling party in recent days has guaranteed returning
politicians safety and offered to share the presidency of
parliament with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party.
	   A FUNCINPEC official closely involved with the negotiations said
Monday that the party has rejected the proposal for co-presidents
of parliament as unconstitutional and has maintained its demand to
be given sole control of the position.
	   ``There is no rationale for that,'' FUNCINPEC member of
parliament Pok Than said. ``You cannot just create something to
please certain people.''
	   Pok Than also said that he had heard of Sihanouk's meeting with
Machimura, but that the party has not received any message from the
king concerning the summit.
	   Machimura, who was to travel to Bangkok on Monday afternoon,
said he did not plan to meet with Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy, but that
the king's wishes may be expressed through Thai officials.
	   Any agreement for a summit inside Cambodia would have to come
soon as the 75-year-old monarch is scheduled to leave the country
next month for an extended stay in Beijing, where he will receive
medical treatment from his Chinese doctors.

Agassi wins Czech Indoor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Second seed Andre Agassi of the
United States has won the IPB Czech Indoor ATP tennis tournament,
defeating Jan Kroslak of Slovakia in the final.
	   Agassi beat Kroslak on Sunday 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, winning 220 points
in ATP ranking and dlrs 137,000 in prize money.
	   Kroslak started the play with an ace, not allowing Agassi to win
a single point in the first game of the first set. But Agassi won
his serve in the second game and broke Kroslak's in the third.
	   He then again broke Kroslak's serve in the fith game, winning
the set 6-2.
	   In the second set, Kroslak again won the first game and followed
by breaking Agassi in the second, winning the set 6-3.
	   In the third set, Kroslak failed to win a breakball in the third
game, and both players held their serves until the eight game of
the set. After Agassi broke Kroslak in that game, he easily won the
last one, not allowing his rival to gain a single point.
	   After the match, Agassi said the third set was the most
difficult but ``I managed to hold my serve.''
	   ``This has been such a great week for me,'' Agassi said,
congratulating Kroslak for his performance in the match.
	   ``I don't know what to say,'' said Kroslak, ranked 153rd in the
world, for whom his appearance in the final was an unexpected
success.

Authorities want to evacuate Russian village without light, heat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Local authorities said Monday they want to
evacuate a village in Russia's Far East that has had no heat or
electricity since a fire destroyed a diesel plant two weeks ago.
	   Drinking water is being brought to Krabozavodskoye in tanker
trucks from a neighboring village, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The village is located on Shikotan Island, one of the Kurile
Islands seized by the Soviet army at the end of World War II and
claimed by both Russia and Japan.
	   Local authorities sent a message to the Russian Ministry for
Emergency Situations and the administration of the Sakhalin Region
suggesting the 1,000 residents be evacuated, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A diesel generator brought in by a helicopter will provide
electricity only for the pumping station, said Valentin Smorchkov,
deputy mayor of the district.
	   ``Air temperature has sharply dropped on the South Kurile
islands,'' he said. ``There are early frosts at night.''
	   Smorchkov said Japan has offered to send food, liquefied gas
cylinders, flashlights, candles and other humanitarian aid.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower in afternoon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond, currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell in sparse trading Monday as
investors took profits following last week's gains. The U.S. dollar
was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 301.24
points, or 2.13 percent, to close at 13,843.46. On Friday, the
average fell 150.86 points, or 1.06 percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 118.86 yen at
mid-afternoon, down 0.28 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above
its New York level of 117.95 yen late Friday.
	   Before Friday's decline, the Nikkei had gained some 1,300
points, or 10 percent, in the preceding five trading days.
	   ``After the Tokyo market gained strongly last week, it is seeing
active profit-taking,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at
Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Traders also said foreign investors were selling to make up for
Wall Street's losses on Friday, when the benchmark Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 80 points.
	   The selling weighed on the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section, driving it down 19.41
points, or 1.81 percent, to 1048.74. The TOPIX dropped 6.14 points,
or 0.57 percent, on Friday.
	   The dollar's relative strength from Friday's New York levels
came amid renewed concern about the health of Japan's financial
system after credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed
four Japanese banks under review last week for possible ratings
downgrades.
	   But such concerns were offset by signs the Japanese government
may finally be moving to tackle the banking industry's bad loan
problem, traders said.
	   In the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since World War
II, the government took control of the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. using new bank rescue legislation passed into
law earlier this month.
	   Public money will be used to write off the bank's billions of
dollars in defaulted loans and a buyer may eventually be sought to
absorb the healthy operations.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond edged up to 0.865 percent from Friday's finish of 0.860
percent, driving its price down to 108.32 yen from 108.37.

National carrier launches Web site

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam Airlines has launched an Internet
Web site to provide customers with information on the national
carrier, the Labor newspaper reported Monday.
	   The site at http://www.vietnamair.com.vn was launched last
Tuesday. It offers flight schedules, contact addresses and other
relevant information in English, French and Vietnamese, the paper
said.
	   Vietnam Airlines is struggling to fight losses incurred from
lower foreign arrivals and revenues. Regional currencies have
plunged since last year, while 70 percent of the airline's
spending, such as leasing aircraft and importing fuel, are in hard
currencies like dollars.
	   The airline lost more than dlrs 3 million last year and expects
to lose money for the next several years.
	   The People's Army newspaper reported Monday that the airline has
transported 1.88 million passengers and 31,000 tons of cargo so far
this year.

Russian airline to link Far East with U.S. West Coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Aeroflot plans to start flying from the Russian
Far East to Alaska and Washington state, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said Monday, two weeks after Alaska Airlines said it was stopping
similar service because of lack of business.
	   Aeroflot said it will fly from Vladivostok and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk
to Anchorage and Seattle.
	   ITAR-Tass said Aeroflot felt there was sufficient business being
generated by people working on oil and gas projects on Sakhalin
Island.
	   Alaska Airlines said earlier this month it was stopping flights
to Russia's Far East because they haven't been making any money
since the country's financial crisis hit in August.
	   Since 1994, Seattle-based Alaska has had two flights a week in
the summer and one in the winter to Russia, serving the cities of
Magadan, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
	   The airline said it would consider resuming service in late
spring.

England concerned about Australian balls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Shane Warne is injured and his teammates
are out of the country, but Australian cricket balls are already
causing trouble for England's Ashes tourists.
	   England bowling coach Bob Cottam has noted that the Kookaburra
balls used Down Under don't swing as much as the Reader brand used
at home.
	   Cottam said England must rely on their ability to reverse swing
the ball in the later stages of an innings to be effective during
the five-test series and will need to keep a tight and disciplined
bowling line.
	   ``The new Kookaburra ball stays hard and swings for about 20
overs _ it roughs up immediately,'' Cottam said Monday. ``All these
balls have quite a proud seam to start with which is made of nylon
and it shears away, so we have to try working on reverse swing
which it hasn't done yet in the nets.''
	   If England's bowlers fail to make the Kookaburra reverse swing
they must strike early and mix up their pace later in the innings.
	   ``We have to use the crease; we have to use slower balls,'' said
Cottam. ``But it must be done in a disciplined way and not bowling
slower from wide of the crease. We have to learn to start bowling
maidens and get discipline into our game at all times.''

Deputy PM: Singapore economy to be flat in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy will probably have zero
growth in 1999, after shrinking in the last two quarters of this
year, deputy prime minister and Monetary Authority chairman Lee
Hsien Loong said in an interview released Monday.
	   Lee did not predict, as many international analysts have done,
that Singapore would fall into a full recession next year, for the
first time since 1985-86. But he left open the possibility. Growth
next year ``could be slightly positive or slightly negative,'' he
said.
	   Recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative
Gross Domestic Product.
	   Singapore's economy is clearly shrinking dramatically, with
growth at 1.6 in the second quarter of this year, down from 6.1
percent in the first quarter.
	   Lee revealed in the interview with Dow Jones Newswires that when
a government package to cut business costs is released next month,
it will include trims in employers' mandatory contributions to the
state-run pension system.
	   But he said any cut in the 26 percent corporate tax rate would
be slight, since the government's target is 25 percent.
	   After 1997 growth of 7.8 percent, Singapore's government is
still officially projecting growth of 0.5 to 1.5 percent for this
year.
	   ``Chances are that we will fall within the range of the official
forecast, but we're not absolutely sure,'' Lee said. ``As for an
informal guess, I would say probably around zero'' growth in 1999.
	   He then said the third and fourth quarters would likely show
contractions from the same periods in 1997.
	   During the last Singapore recession, the government cut
mandatory contributions to the pension system, the Central
Provident Fund, in early 1986 and the economy began to grow again
by the end of the year.
	   Employers and employees each contribute 20 percent of an
employee's gross salary to the employee's pension account.
	   Lee said a cut will definitely be part of the package, aimed at
improving Singapore's competitiveness against its neighbors during
the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``The question now is how much and when and how, rather than
whether or not,'' he said. It was the first clear statement from
the government that there would be a cut. Union and government
leaders had been hinting at it to prepare workers, many of whom use
the pension fund to pay their home mortgages.
	   Lee said neighboring Malaysia's enactment in September of
capital controls that peg the Malaysian ringgit at 3.8 to the U.S.
dollar hurts Singapore's financial sector by halting trade in
ringgit and Malaysian equities.
	   However, he also said, ``The losses resulting from the capital
controls are insignificant if the capital controls work and restore
the Malaysian economy to good health, which will also be good for
Singapore.
	   ``If the Malaysian economy doesn't recover and its problems
become more serious there will be a big impact on us _ far more
than any of these little bits of business we could get in trading
the ringgit,'' he said.
	   Lee, 46, has been one of Singapore's two deputy prime ministers
since 1990 and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's effective central bank, since January.

Nikko Securities dismisses eight, one-third of Singapore staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nikko Securities, one of Japan's ``Big Three''
brokerages, last week fired one-third of its Singapore staff, or
eight out of 24 employees, a company official said Monday.
	   The cuts are in line with reductions by other international
financial institutions. The volatility of the global markets
frightens investors, who are trading less, bringing fewer deals to
the brokerages.
	   Those dismissed by Nikko were back office and sales personnel,
Dow Jones Newswires reported. The company official, who was not
identified, did not say what day the dismissals were carried out.
	   Nikko Securities last Thursday reported a loss of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million), for the six-month period ending Sept. 30.
It said revenues fell at European, Asian and U.S. operations.

Officials assess damage from weakened storm Babs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG _ Severe tropical storm Babs, downgraded after losing
typhoon-strength winds that slammed the Philippines and Taiwan,
moved toward the south China coast Monday, after killing dozens of
people and causing millions of dollars in damage.
	   Babs killed at least 156 people in the Philippines, triggered
massive flooding and landslides in Taiwan and hit Hong Kong with
strong winds before weakening and heading toward mainland China.
	   Philippine officials said Monday the storm damaged 3.1 billion
pesos (dlrs 73.3 million) worth of crops and property. At least 11
people were missing, including two Taiwanese fishermen who fell
from their boat near Camarines Sur province in the Philippines'
hard-hit Bicol region. Ten other Taiwanese were rescued from the
boat.
	   Babs, which had packed winds of more than 140 kph (87 mph),
weakened and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm Sunday night
by the Hong Kong Observatory. Around 0500 GMT, winds were estimated
between 41 to 62 kph (25 to 38 mph).
	   The storm was located 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of
Hong Kong at 0500 GMT and was moving north toward the south China
coast at 15 kph (9 mph), officials at the observatory said.
	   Strong winds and rain hit Hong Kong late Sunday and early
Monday, but no serious storm-related injuries were reported.
	   Early Monday afternoon, a typhoon warning was still in effect in
Hong Kong and several beaches were closed due to rough seas.
	   In Taiwan, Babs' outer fringes brought heavy rains to the whole
island, with eastern Hualien recording 700 millimeters (28 inches)
of rain in a 36-hour period.
	   The storm triggered more landslides in various parts of the
island, disrupting traffic and trapping people in mountains.
Several rivers, including Taipei's Keelung River, swelled their
banks and flooded nearby towns.
	   In the northern city of Keelung, a retaining wall of a hillside
community collapsed, and police evacuated residents from 65
households.

Eight more arrested in one-day revolt against Shevardnadze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Police arrested eight more people
accused of being involved in a one-day revolt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia's security minister said Monday.
	   The arrests on Sunday bring to 31 the number of people detained
in connection with the Oct. 19 revolt by mutinous soldiers in
western Georgia, said State Security Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze.
	   The leader, Akakiy Eliava, remains at large. Eliava is a
military commander who supported the late Georgian president, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died under mysterious circumstances in 1994.
His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.

Cape Town nightclub hit by blast, none injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded outside a popular
Cape Town nightclub causing 10,000 rands (dlrs 5,700) of damage,
but no one was injured, police said on Monday.
	   Club Images was closed when the bomb went off on Sunday evening,
though several staff members were inside at the time. The device,
which police believe was a pipebomb, was planted in the street and
shattered windows and doors at the club.
	   Police spokesman Supt. Wicus Holtzhausen said the club had been
threatened earlier this year by members of a militant anti-crime
group PAGAD, or People Against Gangsterism and Drugs.
	   Asked if police suspected PAGAD was behind the blast,
Holtzhausen replied: ``Yes, that's right.''
	   Club Images is sited in Athlone, a relatively well-off township
in the Cape Flats slum area.
	   For several years PAGAD and drug gangs have fought vicious turf
wars on the Cape Flats and shootings and bombings have become
almost daily occurrences.
	   A pipebomb ripped through a Planet Hollywood restaurant in
August at the popular Waterfront tourist area. That blast killed
two people. No arrests have been reported.

Lab tests show 14 amphetamines manufacturers in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police investigations and laboratory
tests show about 14 illegal manufacturers are flooding Thailand
with amphetamines, a narcotics officer said Monday.
	   Tests by the Food and Drug Administration's narcotics control
division also showed that there were at least 17 production centers
throughout the country, said the officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The study involved the testing of 400 samples of amphetamines
confiscated by police from various provinces in the past year.
Authorities have classified the samples into 14 different groups,
he said.
	   Amphetamines, millions of doses of which have surfaced in
Thailand, are also being produced near the Thai frontier inside
Myanmar.
	   Narcotics gangs in the Golden Triangle _ where the borders of
Myanmar, also known as Burma, Laos and Thailand converge _
traditionally have produced and smuggled heroin, but are turning to
easier-to-make amphetamines as a side business.
	   In September, Myanmar officials seized more than 2 million
amphetamine tablets and more than 1,600 kilograms (3,520 pounds) of
other drugs. A month earlier, 5 million amphetamine tablets were
seized in a truck coming from the Gold Triangle region, according
to the official press in Myanmar.
	   The military government of Myanmar has came under heavy
criticism from the international community for not doing enough to
curb narcotics trafficking.

Saudi-Thai relations rest with solving murders of diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has urged Thailand to
identify the killers of four of its diplomats and one other Saudi
murdered in Thailand eight years ago to fully restore bilateral
ties, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``Saudi Arabia is now regarding the killing of four Saudi
diplomats as the main case that we would like to see solved, with
the men behind it identified,'' Saudi charge d'affaires Waheeb
al-Sehli was quoted in the newspaper The Nation as saying.
	   The Saudi government regarded the case as the ``cornerstone'' of
bilateral ties, he said.
	   Third secretary Saleh Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, was shot dead in
front of his home in January 1989 and three Saudi diplomats were
gunned down in February 1990.
	   Saudi businessman Mohammad Al-Ruwaili, who was in the car with
one of the slain diplomats, disappeared two weeks later. His body
has never been found.
	   The cases have yet to be resolved.
	   The Saudi government believes the murders were linked to the
theft of dlrs 2 million in jewelry from a Saudi Arabian prince by a
Thai worker. Only a portion of the jewelry has been recovered and
returned.
	   The case has damaged relations between the two countries and
prompted the Saudi government to revoke the work visas of nearly
all of the 150,000 Thai workers in Saudi Arabia.
	   It has been reported that a number of Thais powerful enough to
impede the investigation were involved in the disappearance of the
jewelry.
	   Selhi arrived in Bangkok three months ago and bought up the case
with Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and national police chief
Pracha Promnok.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Rain squalls spawned by Hurricane Mitch
forced churches to cancel Sunday services, flooded streets in the
Jamaican capital of Kingston and sent residents scurrying for
provisions.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, swirled in the western Caribbean Sea
south of Jamaica.
	   Packing 150-mph (241-kph) winds, Mitch was a powerful Category 4
hurricane that threatened Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off
Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   As Mitch moved westward, hurricane warnings were lifted for
Jamaica and eastern Cuba. Hondurans, however, should take
precautions, the hurricane center said early Monday, and a tropical
storm watch was in effect for the Caymans.
	   At 0600 GMT Monday, Mitch was 120 miles (193 kilometers)
northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border.
	   In Jamaica, sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards
while squalls pelted Kingston and the country's eastern districts.
With rain expected through Monday, authorities warned of mudslides
and flash floods, especially in the mountains.
	   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, shelters opened
and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents cleared
shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the few
Kingston markets open Sunday.
	   Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and
Montego Bay airports remained open.
	   Hoteliers and tourists kept a wary eye on the storm's progress.
	   ``It's not a very good beach day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager
at the Negril Inn in Jamaica's western resort of Negril. Employees
stockpiled food and plywood to board windows in case Mitch
threatened, he said.
	   ``People are still coming in. I think most people think the
weather's going to pass,'' said Marcia Tomlinson, a receptionist at
the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal resort of Montego
Bay.
	   In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert killed 45 people in Jamaica. The
island was spared, however, by Hurricane Georges, which killed more
than 500 people in the northeast Caribbean last month.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of 28,000, some boat
owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on
essentials. The government allowed markets _ normally closed by law
on Sunday _ to open.

Electricity company cuts power to stretch of Trans-Siberian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional electrical company cut power Monday to
a 1,230-kilometer (765-mile) stretch of the Trans-Siberian Railway
because the railway hasn't paid its bill.
	   Twenty-five freight trains were stranded on the Trans-Baikalian
part of the railway, a dispatcher told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Chitaenergo electrical company cut power from the Petrovsky
Zavod Station in the Chita region of eastern Siberia to the Mogocha
station.
	   ITAR-Tass said the energy company is demanding payment of an 8
million ruble (dlrs 470,000) bill. The railway said it has no money
because shipments have dwindled recently and cargo rates for
vegetables were reduced by a government decree.

Warne tips Gough to play crucial role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Injured Australian star Shane Warne
believes England's Ashes hopes depend more on gritty paceman Darren
Gough than his own presence in the five-test series.
	   Warne aims to take a major step towards proving his fitness for
the Nov. 20 first test when he attempts to bowl in the nets and in
a match for his district team within the next week.
	   He has two Sheffield Shield matches before the test and if he
plays in both he expects to get his spot back to meet England in
the Brisbane series-opener.
	   Warne did some light bowling in the nets last week and then
scored a century for his district team on Saturday. He had further
treatment on his shoulder injury Sunday but on Monday was looking
forward to stepping up his practice.
	   ``I want to get up there and then start to rip a few out and
knock a few people over in the nets and then hopefully play on
Saturday,'' Warne said. ``If I can play the next two Shield games
then I'm a big chance for the test _ but if I can only play one or
none then I'm no chance.''
	   England captain Alec Stewart has said he wants Warne in the
tests so that Australia won't have any excuses if it loses. England
has prepared for the record-breaking leg-spinner, bringing in a
former Australian test player Peter Philpott to help its batsmen
get ready for a meeting with Warne.
	   But Warne believes England's hopes are in their own hands _
particularly those of Gough, who has yet to stay fit through a
five-test series but has played several inspired games against
Australia.
	   ``If England has any chance, Darren Gough's the guy they're
going to have to keep on the park, he's going to have to perform,''
Warne said. ``If Gough doesn't bowl as well as he can, Australia
will probably win comfortably. But by saying that, I don't think
England will be a pushover.''
	   In Perth, England was already preparing for Warne, with several
local leg-spin bowlers invited to test the batsmen at practice
Monday. Afterwards, Philpott said England must attack Warne.
	   ``With a bowler of the quality of Warne if you just sit and wait
it's a matter of time before you get out,'' Philpott said. ``You
have got to have some positive play in trying to attack him. You
can't just rely on survival, it doesn't work.''
	   Philpott, a professional leg-spin coach who played eight tests
for Australia, said England maybe gave wrist spin more respect than
it deserved.
	   ``I'm sure that right around the world _ and particularly in New
Zealand, England and South Africa _ there has been a slight
misunderstanding of wrist spin through lack of exposure,'' Philpott
said. ``Consequently they have developed mystiques that aren't
quite there but there's only a certain amount any leg-spinner can
do and it's all logical, there's nothing mysterious.''
	   Meanwhile paceman Dean Headley was unable to train for a second
day running because of his knee injury.
	   ``When he was finishing his spell yesterday he slipped on the
crease and felt a little bit of pain in the inside of his knee,''
said physiotherapist Wayne Morton. ``He has a bit of soreness,
tenderness and a bit of swelling but it is only the third day so as
a precautionary measure we have rested him.''

 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   For the third week in a row, the Big Four still rule The
Associated Press' Top 25.
	   Top-ranked Ohio State led the pack for the ninth straight
college football poll on Sunday, followed by No. 2 UCLA, No. 3
Tennessee and No. 4 Kansas State.
	   A slight change took place at No. 5 as Florida State slipped
ahead of idle Florida, which dropped to No. 6.
	   Ohio State, 7-0 after a 36-10 win over Northwestern, received 64
of 70 first-place votes and 1,744 points from the sportswriters and
broadcasters on the AP panel.
	   UCLA (6-0), a 28-16 winner over California, had one first-place
vote and 1,641 points, while Tennessee had three first-place votes
and 1,617 points. Kansas State was next with two first-place votes
and 1,565 points. The Volunteers (6-0) beat Alabama 35-18 and the
Wildcats (7-0) routed Iowa State 52-7.
	   The Seminoles (7-1) beat Georgia Tech 34-7 Saturday to move
ahead of the Gators (6-1) by one point _ 1,438-1,437.
	   Nebraska, which held off Missouri 20-13, remained at No. 7,
followed by Texas A-and-M, Wisconsin and Penn State.
	   Missouri (5-2), which entered its game against the Huskers at
No. 19, moved up a notch after the close call at Lincoln, Neb. Last
year, when Nebraska beat Missouri in overtime, the Tigers moved
into the Top 25 the next day for the first time in the '97 season.
	   Georgia, a 28-26 winner over Kentucky, was No. 11, followed by
Oregon, Arizona, Arkansas, Virginia, Notre Dame, Syracuse,
Missouri, Tulane and Virginia Tech.
	   West Virginia, beaten by Miami 34-31, fell eight places to No.
21 and was followed by Michigan, Georgia Tech, Colorado and Miami.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Ohio
State, UCLA, Kansas State, Tennessee and Florida.
	   Michigan and Miami are the new entries in this week's Top 25.
Michigan (5-2) is back after a three-week absence, while the
Hurricanes are back for the first time since early last season.
	   Mississippi State and Texas Tech fell out of the rankings. LSU
beat the Bulldogs 41-6 and Texas A-and-M defeated the Red Raiders
17-10.

Official says Cambodia making steady progress on mine scourge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Even though it will take decades to
remove the millions of land mines buried in Cambodia, their daily
threat of death and injury could be blunted in three to four years,
an official said Monday.
	   Speaking to reporters before the opening of an international
forum on mine clearing, Cambodian Mine Action Center chairman Ieng
Mouly said Cambodia was well on the way to achieving its goal of
protecting people from mine-related injuries _ the main topic of
the three-day conference.
	   ``The object is to achieve the state of zero victims. That we
can achieve in a few years,'' Ieng Mouly said.
	   Cambodia's population of 11 million includes 40,000 amputees
maimed by mines or unexploded ordnance. Although civilian casualty
rates are falling, more than 900 people were killed or maimed in
the first nine months of this year, according to local press
reports.
	   CMAC estimated in 1993, as decades of civil war were coming to a
close, that Cambodia had 10 million mines buried within its
borders.
	   After five years of intensive surveying and mine clearing, that
estimate has fallen to 4 million to 6 million mines. Cambodia was
asked last year to share its experience with the deadly devices by
staging an international conference, Ieng Mouly said.
	   CMAC, using a dlrs 12 million budget supplied by more than 15
countries and international aid agencies, employs a multi-pronged
anti-mine strategy including surveying, mine removal and mine
awareness education.
	   ``I don't want to say we are the model, but the donor countries
have asked us to host this conference because they say we have been
very effective,'' Ieng Mouly said.
	   The International Forum on Demining and Victim Assistance has
attracted more than 200 participants from around the world,
including delegates from other mine-infested nations such as
Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nicaragua and Somalia.
	   In a speech at the opening session, Cambodian leader Hun Sen
urged his nation's parliament to pass a law forbidding the use or
possession of land mines in Cambodia.
	   Passage of the law and parliamentary approval of Cambodia's
signing of the ``Ottawa Convention'' _ an international treaty
banning land mines _ has been held up by a delay in forming a new
government following a July election.
	   Hun Sen also called for lasting peace in Cambodia, which has
been hampered by low-level fighting between the government army and
insurgent armed forces lodged in the jungles along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
	   Fighting flared in the Cambodian northwest last week between Hun
Sen's troops and forces loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was
ousted by Hun Sen as co-prime minister in a violent coup last year.
	   Gen. Ek Sam On, chief of staff of government forces in the
region, downplayed the fighting Monday as minor skirmishes, despite
the defections to the resistance of two middle-ranking army
officers.
	   Despite pledges by the government that it has stopped using
mines, both sides are known to still plant the devices as they
attempt to protect newly captured territory.
	   Khmer Rouge guerrillas also contributed greatly to the Cambodian
mine scourge by producing thousands of primitive explosive devices
until their mine factory was captured by the government in March.
	   The once fierce Khmer Rouge army has been reduced to a small
band of guerrillas since a spate of defections began in 1996.
Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April of an apparent
heart attack shortly after the guerrillas' last major base came
under government control.

Yeltsin at country residence preparing for trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has recovered from a
recent illness, worked at his country residence on Monday in
preparation for a trip to Austria, his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from the respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this month.
Doctors pronounced him fit after a medical checkup last week, but
the Russian leader has still not returned to work full time in the
Kremlin, and is limiting his Austrian trip to one day instead of
the two originally planned.
	   Press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working Monday
at his Gorky-9 residence outside of Moscow, getting ready for his
trip to Vienna on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeltsin's agenda in Vienna includes a meeting with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two are expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin is also scheduled to meet with International Monetary
Fund and World Bank officials to discuss economic assistance to
Russia.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Officials accompanying Yeltsin will sign a number of economic
agreements that should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment
to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has serious
health problems.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Typhoon Babs forced two Russian ships in the
Taiwan Strait to request permission to seek shelter in Chinese
ports, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   Chinese authorities said the Igor Ilyinsky could dock at the

	   Babs struck Taiwan on Sunday. It was not clear whether it would

Officials say typhoon damage won't plunge Philippines into
</HEADLINE>
recession &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will not plunge into
a recession and is still likely to achieve its growth targets this
year despite the devastation caused by two recent typhoons,
officials said Monday.
	   Although some key agricultural areas were destroyed, many others
were spared and the damage was well within the scope anticipated by
economic planners in setting growth targets, the officials said.
	   ``I don't see any recession on the horizon,'' said Ruperto
Alonzo, deputy director-general of the National Economic and
Development Authority.
	   He said growth targets of 1.5 percent for gross national product
and 1 percent for gross domestic product remain achievable this
year. GNP includes the billions of dollars sent home each year by
overseas Filipino workers, while GDP does not.
	   Last week, Typhoon Babs smashed coconut- and abaca-producing
provinces in the impoverished eastern Bicol region and then ripped
through the main northern island of Luzon, killing at least 156
people and damaging infrastructure and crops.
	   The National Disaster Coordinating Council said damage from Babs
totaled 3.1 billion pesos (dlrs 73.8 million), including 1.8
billion pesos (dlrs 42.8 million) in agriculture.
	   Two weeks earlier, Typhoon Zeb ravaged Luzon's northern region,
killing at least 74 people and destroying tobacco, rice and
vegetable crops.
	   Alonzo's comments to reporters differed from those of some other
economists quoted in Philippine newspapers Monday, who said the
extensive damage to infrastructure and crops would force the
economy into recession.
	   Alonzo said government planners had already projected a 6.8
percent drop in agricultural production for the period, and
preliminary figures indicated it had dropped only 1 percent.
	   He said it was fortunate the typhoons spared many important
agricultural centers, including the southern region of Mindanao,
considered one of the country's food baskets.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said that after a prolonged
drought last year attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon, the
government prepared early this year for La Nina, an opposite
weather pattern characterized by heavy rains and extensive
flooding.
	   ``We were prepared for the worst,'' he said. ``On a net basis,
it looks like we could come out better.''

Officials assess damage from weakened storm Babs

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Severe tropical storm Babs, downgraded after
losing typhoon-strength winds that slammed the Philippines and
Taiwan, moved toward the south China coast on Monday, after killing
dozens of people and causing millions in damage.
	   Babs killed at least 156 people in the Philippines, triggered
massive flooding and landslides in Taiwan and hit Hong Kong with
strong winds before weakening and heading toward mainland China.
	   Philippine officials said Monday the storm damaged 3.1 billion
pesos (dlrs 73.3 million) worth of crops and property. At least 11
people were missing, including two Taiwanese fishermen who fell
from their boat near Camarines Sur province in the Philippines'
hard-hit Bicol region. Ten other Taiwanese were rescued from the
boat.
	   Babs, which packed winds of more than 140 kph (87 mph) at its
height, weakened and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm
Sunday night by the Hong Kong Observatory. Around 0500 GMT, winds
were estimated between 41 to 62 kph (25 to 38 mph).
	   The storm was located 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of
Hong Kong at 0500 GMT and was moving north toward the south China
coast at 15 kph (9 mph), officials at the observatory said.
	   Strong winds and rain hit Hong Kong late Sunday and early
Monday, but no serious storm-related injuries were reported.
	   Early Monday afternoon, a typhoon warning was still in effect in
Hong Kong and several beaches were closed due to rough seas.
	   In Taiwan, Babs' outer fringes brought heavy rains to the whole
island, with eastern Hualien recording 700 millimeters (28 inches)
of rain in a 36-hour period.
	   The storm triggered more landslides in various parts of the
island, disrupting traffic and trapping people in mountains.
Several rivers, including Taipei's Keelung River, swelled its banks
and flooded nearby towns.
	   In northern Keelung, a retaining wall of a hillside community
collapsed, and police evacuated residents from 65 households.

Official says Cambodia making steady progress on mine scourge

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Even though it will take decades to
remove the millions of land mines buried in Cambodia, their daily
threat of death and injury could be blunted in three to four years,
an official said Monday.
	   Speaking to reporters before the opening of an international
forum on mine clearing, Cambodian Mine Action Center chairman Ieng
Mouly said Cambodia was well on the way to achieving its goal of
protecting people from mine-related injuries _ the main topic of
the three-day conference.
	   ``The object is to achieve the state of zero victims. That we
can achieve in a few years,'' Ieng Mouly said.
	   Cambodia's population of 11 million includes 40,000 amputees
maimed by mines or unexploded ordnance. Although civilian casualty
rates are falling, more than 900 people were killed or maimed in
the first nine months of this year, according to local press
reports.
	   CMAC estimated in 1993, as decades of civil war were coming to a
close, that Cambodia had 10 million mines buried within its
borders.
	   After five years of intensive surveying and mine clearing, that
estimate has fallen to 4 million to 6 million mines. Cambodia was
asked last year to share its experience with the deadly devices by
staging an international conference, Ieng Mouly said.
	   CMAC, using a dlrs 12 million budget supplied by more than 15
countries and international aid agencies, employs a multi-pronged
anti-mine strategy including surveying, mine removal and mine
awareness education.
	   ``I don't want to say we are the model, but the donor countries
have asked us to host this conference because they say we have been
very effective,'' Ieng Mouly said.
	   The International Forum on Demining and Victim Assistance has
attracted more than 200 participants from around the world,
including delegates from other mine-infested nations such as
Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nicaragua and Somalia.
	   In a speech at the opening session, Cambodian leader Hun Sen
urged his nation's parliament to pass a law forbidding the use or
possession of land mines in Cambodia.
	   Passage of the law and parliamentary approval of Cambodia's
signing of the ``Ottawa Convention'' _ an international treaty
banning land mines _ has been held up by a delay in forming a new
government following a July election.
	   Hun Sen also called for lasting peace in Cambodia, which has
been hampered by low-level fighting between the government army and
insurgent armed forces lodged in the jungles along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
	   Fighting flared in the Cambodian northwest last week between Hun
Sen's troops and forces loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was
ousted by Hun Sen as co-prime minister in a violent coup last year.
	   Gen. Ek Sam On, chief of staff of government forces in the
region, downplayed the fighting Monday as minor skirmishes, despite
the defections to the resistance of two middle-ranking army
officers.
	   Despite pledges by the government that it has stopped using
mines, both sides are known to still plant the devices as they
attempt to protect newly captured territory.
	   Khmer Rouge guerrillas also contributed greatly to the Cambodian
mine scourge by producing thousands of primitive explosive devices
until their mine factory was captured by the government in March.
	   The once fierce Khmer Rouge army has been reduced to a small
band of guerrillas since a spate of defections began in 1996.
Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April of an apparent
heart attack shortly after the guerrillas' last major base came
under government control.

Russian Cabinet to discuss economic program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov scheduled a
Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss a long-expected program for
dealing with Russia's latest economic crisis.
	   The lack of such a plan, six weeks after Primakov took office,
has worried international lenders.
	   The program is a ``very thorough document'' combining urgent
matters with long-term goals, Primakov said over the weekend.
Following Monday's discussion, the Cabinet will spend another week
finalizing the plan, he said.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders want to see a
sound economic plan and signs it is being implemented before
releasing more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated
during the summer.

Daimler stock swap tops hoped-for 90 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz said Monday that around
97 percent of its shares were exchanged for shares in
DaimlerChrysler, bringing the merger closer to qualifying for
profit-friendly accounting treatment and winning Daimler
shareholders a bonus.
	   Since more than 90 percent of Daimler shares were swapped,
Daimler shareholders will receive an additional share in the new
company for every 200 Daimler shares held. The bonus was introduced
to encourage shareholders to exchange shares.
	   Daimler also has extended the stock-swap offer by two weeks,
until Nov. 6, to comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission rules. The extension is required because the bonus
shares have altered the original stock-swap ratio of the merger,
Daimler said.
	   By clearing the 90 percent threshold for shares exchanged,
DaimlerChrysler is likely to be able to use the pooling-of-interest
accounting method, which avoids having to take goodwill charges of
dlrs 35 billion over the next 40 years.
	   However, Daimler stressed that DaimlerChrysler will only be able
to use the profit-friendly accounting method if Chrysler issues 30
million shares out of its own share-buyback program. The new shares
will be put into Chrysler's pension fund, Daimler said.

Report: South African truth panel to condemn ANC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid-era
abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights
violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state
broadcaster said Monday.
	   The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in
power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect
implication in right violations.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final
report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report was
expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white
governments and their brutal security services.
	   South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a
``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and
morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and
after the fall of apartheid.
	   An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report
referred to a commission letter sent in advance ``informing us of
its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights
violations.''
	   Commission officials could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting
with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid
appearing embarrassed.
	   The party says the accusations against it likely would center on
the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military
camps in Angola and bombings.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced his
first political test Monday following his land-for-security deal
with the Palestinians, with parliament likely to defeat a motion of
no confidence in the government.
	   However, another _ perhaps more serious _ threat to Netanyahu's
rule appeared on the horizon, with parliament's Law Committee
convening to discuss an early elections bill.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat, who staunchly opposes the new
peace agreement, said he expected to get a majority in the panel
for approving the bill for a first reading in parliament. Three
readings are required for the bill to become law.
	   ``I believe that the process we are beginning will conclude with
the dispersal of parliament and early elections ... around February
or March,'' Porat told Israel radio.
	   Monday's motion of no confidence was submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet which rejects the agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu was was expected to survive the vote, since
the dovish opposition said it would not vote with Moledet.
	   Still, the opposition, led by Labor Party chief Ehud Barak,
appeared to be divided over whether to bring down Netanyahu as
quickly as possible or to wait until the West Bank troop withdrawal
is carried out.
	   Under the agreement, Israel has 12 weeks to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for an accelerated
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. The clock starts
ticking next week.
	   Netanyahu was to present the accord to his Cabinet on Monday,
but postponed the session until Wednesday, apparently concerned he
didn't have the necessary support yet among his ministers.
	   Netanyahu met Monday morning with ministers from his Likud Party
to try and win their backing for the agreement which has broad
public support.
	   In an interview with Israel army radio, Netanyahu said he won
assurances from the United States that Palestinians suspected of
killing Israelis would serve long terms. ``We know that all ...
will do time for dozens of years,'' he said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel retained the right to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Army radio reported that the government would soon begin
construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, apparently to blunt hardline
opposition to a withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu did not deny the report, saying only that he had not
decided when to start building. ``We have said that building will
take place in Har Homa by 2000, and this will happen,'' he said.
	   With an eye on his right-wing critics, Netanyahu issued a stern
warning to Arafat that no land would be handed over without keeping
their promises.
	   ``With the completion of each step, they will receive. They give
and only then we give,'' Netanyahu said Sunday night.
	   Honoring the deal won't be easy for Arafat, either.
	   On Monday, a general strike was observed in the West Bank town
of Ramallah to protest the death of an 18-year-old supporter of
Arafat's Fatah faction who was shot in the head during a raid of
Fatah headquarters in the city by Palestinian military
intelligence.
	   Intelligence agents were searching for illegal weapons in the
Fatah offices, though it was not immediately clear whether Sunday's
raid was part of an internal feud or a first sign that Arafat is
honoring a promise in the agreement to confiscate illegal weapons.
	   Meanwhile, the Palestinians made it clear that they have not
relinquished one of their main bargaining chips _ the threat to
declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999 _ if Israel fails to
implement the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said that the Palestinians
were ``still committed to a May 4 announcement.''

Taliban launch inquiry into charges of terrorism against bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The leader of Afghanistan's Taliban
army has launched a judicial inquiry into allegations of terrorism
against Osama bin Laden -- the man Washington calls enemy number
one, a spokesman said Monday.
	   ``The whole world is accusing bin Laden of terrorism, but we are
saying he is not involved in this,'' said Abdul Hai Muttmayan, a
Taliban spokesman reached by satellite telephone at his
headquarters in southern Kandahar. ``We have given power to the
Supreme Court inquiry to hear evidence against Osama from anywhere
in the world.''
	   The inquiry was set up by a decree issued by Mullah Mohammed
Omar, the Taliban's reclusive leader and self-declared Amir
ul-Momineen or leader of the Muslim faithful.
	   The United States charges bin Laden masterminded the deadly
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa in August that killed
more than 200 people and wounded thousands others.
	   Bin Laden, a millionaire Saudi Arabian, was exiled from his
homeland after threatening to overthrow the Saudi monarchy for
allowing U.S. soldiers to be stationed in Saudi Arabia, home to
Islam's two holiest sites at Mecca and Medina.
	   ``After the attacks in East Africa, this propaganda against
Osama has become more severe . . . we have clarified that Osama was
not involved in these blasts,'' said Muttmayan. ``But there are
still allegations against him so we feel we should clear up the
whole situation.''
	   The Supreme Court judicial inquiry will be headed by the
Taliban's Chief Justice Mullah Noor Mohammed Saqib, a graduate of
one of Pakistan's largest religious schools, Dar-ul Aloom Haqqania.
	   On Aug. 20 the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan aimed at suspected terrorist camps run by bin
Laden.
	   While the death toll has varied, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers
say 26 people were killed, including several Pakistanis belonging
to Harakat-ul Ansar an Islamic group on Washington's list of
terrorist organizations.
	   Muttmayan said the inquiry also will investigate the killings in
August of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The killings sent already poor relations into a tailspin and
Tehran deployed more than 200,000 soldiers on its border with
Afghanistan threatening to take revenge for the death of its
nationals.
	   The United Nations sent its special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to the
region to soothe tempers and defuse tensions, something he
accomplished after a visit to Tehran and southern Kandahar, where
he was the first U.N. envoy to meet Omar.
	   Muttmayan said the inquiry will compile evidence in both cases
and decide whether charges will be laid. If charges are laid
Muttmayan said a trial would be held in Afghanistan in keeping with
Islamic laws, imposed in the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the
Taliban.

Mahathir blasts foreign media, hints at possible controls

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister accused
the international news media Monday of distorting his country's
political trouble, and warned he has a ``legal obligation'' to curb
those who misuse their power.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad plans any formal limits on foreign reporters, always one of
his main targets of criticism.
	   Mahathir has been lambasted for his arrest of former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, once in line to take over the
government of the Southeast Asian nation but now a prisoner
awaiting trial on sex and corruption charges.
	   ``Today it is quite impossible to stop what comes through the
air. Any amount of lies can be spread, and there is practically
nothing we can do about this,'' Mahathir told an international
editors' group in the Malaysian capital.
	   ``We accept that,'' he said. ``But we will have to exercise some
form of legal obligation in this country in order to ensure that
people who are given power do not misuse power.''
	   An opinion piece in the influential, government-backed newspaper
New Straits Times recently suggested that troublesome foreign
reporters could be thrown in jail.
	   Much of Mahathir's address to the opening session of the
Commonwealth Press Union on Monday was devoted to the role of the
news media and what he sees as their excesses.
	   ``The media is powerful, in most instances more powerful than
governments and politicians like me,'' the prime minister told
about 500 delegates to the conference, which groups journalists
from countries that once belonged to the British Empire.
	   One of the three main goals of the Commonwealth Press Union is
``the protection of press freedom and the defense of organizations
or individuals who come under threat.''
	   Mahathir said that ``the impression given to people all over the
world is that Malaysia is in a state of perpetual turmoil, a police
state where police brutality is a daily, or even an hourly
occurrence.''
	   He likely was still smarting from a violent demonstration
Saturday in which, for the first time, protesters lobbed stones at
riot police after being doused with tear gas.
	   Mahathir accused Anwar of instigating the seemingly endless
round of rowdy street protests, in hopes of toppling Asia's
longest-serving ruler.
	   ``We cannot be brought down by demonstrations in the streets,''
Mahathir told the delegates in a brief question-and-answer session
after his speech.
	   Anwar goes on trial next Monday under a glare of international
publicity bound to hurt Malaysia's image.
	   The former deputy prime minister shocked supporters and some
world leaders when he was hauled to court with a black eye. He
claims he was beaten by police in custody, though the government is
investigating the charge and Mahathir even implied the bruises were
self-inflicted.
	   The fuss over Anwar stole much of the spotlight from last
month's Commonwealth Games. It already is casting a shadow over
next month's summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific region to be
held in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Mahathir said the international media only sensed ``an enduring
scoop'' in the Anwar story. He reiterated his claim that their goal
was to undermine his country.
	   ``I cannot help but feel that the international, or more
precisely the Western media, would like to teach Malaysia a lesson,
to pull it down a few pegs more,'' he said.

Miller puts Australia in firm control of final Test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Colin Miller grabbed three wickets in
just 22 balls before lunch to put Australia on the road to victory
on the last day of the third and final cricket Test against
Pakistan Monday.
	   Pakistan, needing a huge 419 runs to level the three-match
series, was hopelessly placed at 78 for four at the end of the
first session with only one recognized batsman Inzamamul Haq to
follow.
	   It would have been five down for Pakistan had Taylor not spilled
an edge off Ijaz Ahmed in the first slip off paceman Glenn McGrath
when the batsman had scored just two. Ahmed was unbeaten on 34
while wicketkeeper batsman Moin Khan had yet to score.
	   Pakistan started off briskly with skipper Aamir Sohail hammering
McGrath for three successive boundaries and the total racing to 20
by the end of third over.
	   However, 34-year-old Miller broke the momentum when debutante
Shahid Afridi departed after six runs. Then 18-year-old Afridi
tried to drive the medium paceman and got a thin edge to
wicketkeeper Ian Healy.
	   Miller further reduced Pakistan to 35 for three when he had
Sohail and veteran Salim Malik trapped leg before wicket.
	   Yousaf Youhanna also struggled as McGrath passed the outside
edge of the right-hander's bat on a number of occasions. He scored
his first run after 52 minutes and 39 balls.
	   Just before lunch, leg-spinner Stuart MacGill struck and
Youhanna (11) was caught by Mark Waugh at silly mid off.

Wife of jailed dissident says rioters acted in self-defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of Malaysia's jailed
dissident leader said Monday violent riots over the weekend were
sparked by growing frustration with police brutality and the
17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   An anti-government protest at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur Saturday
night turned into a violent clash when police lobbed tear gas and
shot chemical-laced water jets into the Muslim house of worship as
demonstrators hurled stones and bricks.
	   It was the first time demonstrators had retaliated against
police, who have banned rallies supporting ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim. Police arrested 268 people for rioting.
Some appeared to be weekend shoppers caught in the middle of the
afternoon demonstration.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, called the rioting ``a violent
tragedy,'' and a ``manifestation of the people's anger toward Dr.
Mahathir which could not be contained any longer.''
	   She warned that more disruptions could break out.
	   ``They have no other avenue,'' Azizah told reporters, adding she
believed demonstrators acted out of self-defense after being
provoked by riot police.
	   ``Trouble may probably occur if the people have to defend
themselves from the brutal actions of the riot squad.''
	   Peaceful anti-government demonstrations have gained momentum
since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20. Thousands have mobbed the streets of
the capital in what have become weekly Saturday affairs, demanding
the resignation of the 72-year-old Mahathir.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy Sept. 2, saying his former
protege was morally unfit to lead. Anwar goes on trial on Nov. 2 on
10 charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, which he says
were trumped up to stem his rising popularity.
	   On Saturday, protesters and police blamed each other for coming
to blows. Police said they spotted protesters with homemade
explosives, and violence started when some threw stones. Protesters
said police fired first.
	   Azizah, who was appointed by Anwar to lead his reform movement
while he is in custody, denied any role in organizing Saturday's
protests.
	   ``Neither I nor Anwar Ibrahim has ever directed, asked or urged
the people to hold any kind of illegal gathering, what's more, to
instruct the people to act violently while destroying public
property,'' Azizah said. ``This is a total contradiction to what we
stand for.''
	   Anwar's case drew concern from the United States, Australia and
many Southeast Asian neighbors when he appeared in court with a
black eye and bruised right arm. Anwar said the injuries resulted
from a police beating.
	   On Monday, the wife of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last colonial
governor and a friend of Anwar's, paid a private visit to Azizah.
The two sat for 45 minutes in Azizah's living room discussing what
one aide said was Mrs. Patten's ``concerns over the Anwar
situation.''
	   Mahathir, meanwhile, accused Anwar Monday of instigating the
street protests in hopes of toppling Asia's longest-serving ruler.
	   ``We cannot be brought down by demonstrations in the streets,''
Mahathir told a group of foreign editors.
	   The city's police chief, Kamarrudin Ali, called the Saturday
riot ``the most serious incident to date.''
	   ``We have no choice but to take stern action against them. If
their actions are left unchecked, innocent bystanders might fall
victim,'' the police chief said Sunday.

Hyundai chief to visit North Korea with 501 more cattle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five Hyundai executives flew to North
Korea Monday to prepare for Tuesday's scheduled border crossing by
the conglomerate's honorary chairman and 501 more cattle.
	   Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's founder, plans to follow the cattle
across the heavily armed border at Panmunjom, the only crossing
point between the two Koreas.
	   Chung gave his native North Korea an initial 500 cattle during a
visit in June as part of Hyundai's effort to do business in the
communist country.
	   Hyundai already has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai officials in Seoul said the exact date of the first tour
will be decided during Chung's four-day visit. They hope the first
ship can sail in mid-November.
	   The second cattle donation has been delayed because of North
Korean accusations that 71 of the 500 cattle donated in June died
because of a South Korean government plot to kill the animals by
force-feeding them indigestible materials.
	   A survey of other Hyundai cattle being raised at the group's
ranch found that some of them also have indigestible hemp rope and
vinyl strips in their stomachs, apparently picked up from the
landfill used to build up the area.
	   North Korea then called the issue a misunderstanding and South
Korea dropped its demand for an apology, clearing the way for
Chung's second visit.
	   Hyundai officials said they have taken precautions to assure
that none of the 501 cattle to be donated Tuesday have such
problems.
	   Also to be donated Tuesday will be 20 Hyundai passenger cars
worth 700 million won (dlrs 500,000), Hyundai officials said.
	   Chung expects to meet the North's new leader, Kim Jong Il,
during this week's visit, Hyundai officials said. North Korean
officials had promised in June that Chung would be allowed to meet
the leader during his second visit, they said.

Leader of May 68 heads Greens list for Europarliament election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The former leader of France's May 68 student
upheaval, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, will head the list of French Greens
candidates in Europarliament elections next year.
	   Of the 6,500 members at the environmentalist party's general
assembly Sunday night, 76 percent voted for the now more-pragmatic
Cohn-Bendit to lead them into the June election.
	   Cohn-Bendit's campaign will not be based on ``the man of the
past, but of the one of the present and the future,'' said Jean-Luc
Bennahmias, secretary-general of the Greens.
	   Cohn-Bendit led the student movement that spearheaded nationwide
protests and paralyzed the country in May 1968, as workers and
youths demanded reform of the government, schools and workplace.
	   Since then, the dual Franco-German national has gone into
politics. He has served as an aide to the mayor of Frankfurt and
was elected as a German member of the Europarliament. He will run
as a Frenchman next year.
	   The French Greens have been heartened and emboldened by advances
of the German Greens, who have key Cabinet posts in the new
government of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Cohn-Bendit has said the German Greens ``have grown up'' and
become more pragmatic. The party reached a compromise with the
German Socialist Party to form the government with Schroeder.
	   In France, the Greens have only the Environment Ministry in the
leftist government.
	   The party is to announce its full list of candidates at a
general assembly Nov. 14-15, then launch its campaign at the end of
February.

Philippine Airlines to resume flights to Middle East, Asian
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Monday it
will resume flights soon to several Middle Eastern and Asian
countries to serve an expected influx of overseas Filipinos coming
home for the Christmas holidays.
	   The national flag carrier will also expand its flights to the
United States using Boeing 747-400 planes, which U.S. creditors
have threatened to seize.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, shut down operations on Sept. 23
after a union representing ground personnel turned down a
management-proposed recovery plan that included a 10-year
suspension of collective bargaining in exchange for 20 percent
ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   PAL said it will resume flights on Dec. 1 to the Saudi Arabian
cities of Dhahran and Riyadh, with service three times a week. Both
cities have large numbers of Filipino construction workers and
housemaids.
	   Asian flights will resume Nov. 11, including daily flights to
Tokyo and 14 flights a week to Hong Kong, the airline said in a
statement. Service to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka will
begin later in November.
	   PAL said it would like to regain ``its customary place among the
leading airlines of Asia after a long absence from the
international scene.''
	   The airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7. It previously
announced it would begin thrice-weekly flights between Manila and
Los Angeles, with stopovers in San Francisco, this Thursday. The
two U.S. destinations will be served with separate flights from
Manila starting Nov. 11.
	   PAL said it initially will use Airbus A340-300 planes on the
U.S. flights. A PAL official said the airline is wary of using the
larger Boeing 747-400 planes because of fears they could be seized
by foreign creditors in the United States.
	   Two of PAL's four Boeing 747-400 planes were seized earlier by
authorities in Hong Kong and Los Angeles at the request of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, which financed them. Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission has since asked the Ex-Im Bank to return the
planes.
	   PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by Asia's
continuing financial crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways and
Northwest Airlines of the United States, are negotiating with PAL
officials for a possible stake in the airline.

Iraq accuses Israel of dropping crocodile eggs in Iraqi lakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deadly pens and exploding cigars? Amateur.
	   Israeli spies _ according to a popular Iraqi newspaper _ are
putting crocodile eggs in two lakes in northern Iraq.
	   That ploy follows the release of ``large quantities'' of cobra
snakes near Iraqi forces in the north, said Babil, a daily
newspaper owned by Odai Hussein, the Iraqi president's eldest son.
	   Northern Iraq is under the control of Kurdish factions helped by
a no-fly zone enforced by U.S. and allied warplanes.
	   Adnan Mufti, a representative of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, which controls the region around the lakes of Dokan and
Darbandi Khan, called the report ``silly and stupid propaganda.''
	   ``How can one do that in lakes where thousands of our people
live and eat from their fish?'' he said from Cairo, Egypt.
	   The newspaper did not elaborate on the goal of the operation,
and there was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.
	   The lakes are fed by tributaries of the Tigris River.

 &UR; Parliament hardliners begin process of holding early elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cabinet meeting postponed until
Wednesday, parliament committee meeting to discuss early elections
law; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced his
first political test Monday following his land-for-security deal
with the Palestinians, with parliament likely to defeat a motion of
no confidence in the government.
	   However, another _ perhaps more serious _ threat to Netanyahu's
rule appeared on the horizon, with parliament's Law Committee
convening to discuss an early elections bill.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat, who staunchly opposes the new
peace agreement, said he expected to get a majority in the panel
for approving the bill for a first reading in parliament. Three
readings are required for the bill to become law.
	   ``I believe that the process we are beginning will conclude with
the dispersal of parliament and early elections ... around February
or March,'' Porat told Israel radio.
	   Monday's motion of no confidence was submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet which rejects the agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu was expected to survive the vote, since the
dovish opposition said it would not vote with Moledet.
	   Still, the opposition, led by Labor Party chief Ehud Barak,
appeared to be divided over whether to bring down Netanyahu as
quickly as possible or to wait until the West Bank troop withdrawal
is carried out.
	   Under the agreement, Israel has 12 weeks to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for an accelerated
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. The clock starts
ticking next week.
	   Netanyahu was to present the accord to his Cabinet on Monday,
but postponed the session until Wednesday, apparently concerned he
didn't have the necessary support yet among his ministers.
	   Netanyahu met Monday morning with ministers from his Likud Party
to try and win their backing for the agreement which has broad
public support.
	   In an interview with Israel army radio, Netanyahu said he won
assurances from the United States that Palestinians suspected of
killing Israelis would serve long terms. ``We know that all ...
will do time for dozens of years,'' he said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel retained the right to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Army radio reported that the government would soon begin
construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, apparently to blunt hardline
opposition to a withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu did not deny the report, saying only that he had not
decided when to start building. ``We have said that building will
take place in Har Homa by 2000, and this will happen,'' he said.
	   With an eye on his right-wing critics, Netanyahu issued a stern
warning to Arafat that no land would be handed over without keeping
their promises.
	   ``With the completion of each step, they will receive. They give
and only then we give,'' Netanyahu said Sunday night.
	   Honoring the deal won't be easy for Arafat, either.
	   On Monday, a general strike was observed in the West Bank town
of Ramallah to protest the death of an 18-year-old supporter of
Arafat's Fatah faction who was shot in the head during a raid of
Fatah headquarters in the city by Palestinian military
intelligence.
	   Intelligence agents were searching for illegal weapons in the
Fatah offices, though it was not immediately clear whether Sunday's
raid was part of an internal feud or a first sign that Arafat is
honoring a promise in the agreement to confiscate illegal weapons.
	   Meanwhile, the Palestinians made it clear that they have not
relinquished one of their main bargaining chips _ the threat to
declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999 _ if Israel fails to
implement the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said that the Palestinians
were ``still committed to a May 4 announcement.''

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Monday amid
concern that Wall Street's wild ride may not be over. Japanese
stocks dropped on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 119.02 yen in late afternoon, down 0.12 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but above its New York level of 117.95
yen late Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average tumbled 301.24 points, or 2.13 percent, closing at
13,843.46. On Friday, the average had fallen 150.86 points, or 1.06
percent.
	   Traders said that while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has
made a positive showing for seven of the last eight sessions, it's
too early to say that the stock market has settled down after wild
swings earlier in the year.
	   ``Nervousness about U.S. financial markets hasn't been
completely wiped away,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign
exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   That makes local investors weary of increasing their U.S.
holdings, putting a damper on demand for dollars.
	   Trading in Tokyo saw the dollar move as low as 118.30 yen and as
high as 119.05.
	   Meanwhile, electronics companies such as Toshiba Corp. and newly
listed telecommunications giant NTT Mobile Communications Network
led the overall stock market lower in sparse trading.
	   Investors sold to lock in gains made during the Nikkei's 10
percent surge in the five days leading up to Friday.
	   ``After the Tokyo market gained strongly last week, it is seeing
active profit-taking,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at
Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Traders also said foreign investors were selling to make up for
Wall Street's losses Friday, when the benchmark Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 80 points.
	   An estimated 318 million shares changed hands on the first
section, well below Friday's 468 million. Declines outnumbered
gains by two to one.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 19.41 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,048.74. It
had dropped 6.14 points, or 0.57 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond edged up to 0.870 percent from Friday's finish of 0.860
percent, driving its price down to 108.27 yen from 108.37.

Iraq accuses Israel of dropping crocodile eggs in Iraqi lakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deadly pens and exploding cigars? Amateur.
	   Israeli spies _ according to a popular Iraqi newspaper _ are
putting crocodile eggs in two lakes in northern Iraq.
	   That ploy follows the release of ``large quantities'' of cobra
snakes near Iraqi forces in the north, said Babil, a daily
newspaper owned by Odai Hussein, the Iraqi president's eldest son.
	   Northern Iraq is under the control of Kurdish factions helped by
a no-fly zone enforced by U.S. and allied warplanes.
	   Adnan Mufti, a representative of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, which controls the region around the lakes of Dokan and
Darbandi Khan, called the report ``silly and stupid propaganda.''
	   ``How can one do that in lakes where thousands of our people
live and eat from their fish?'' he said from Cairo, Egypt.
	   The newspaper did not elaborate on the goal of the operation,
and there was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.
	   The lakes are fed by tributaries of the Tigris River.

ASEAN bankers optimistic despite industry's weakness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Commercial bankers from Southeast
Asia believe the region's economic crisis has crested, and expect
currency exchange rates to continue to stabilize and interest rates
to keep falling.
	   Bankers from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam met at the 12th Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Banking Conference in the northern city of
Chiang Mai, concluded over the weekend.
	   Even if problems in Latin America cause another round of market
turmoil, the impact on their economies won't be as great as it was
in the beginning of the crisis last year, the bankers said.
	   ``ASEAN governments have taken several corrective actions'' to
restructure their financial systems, said Singapore's Tay Kah Chye,
secretary-general of the ASEAN Bankers Association. ``We're
confident that the actions taken by governments have shown positive
impact and interest rates are coming down.''
	   Reforms must continue so banks will be able to resume lending
and spur sagging economies, he added.
	   ``We will see strengthening of currencies, provided governments
continue to pursue reform'' and regional economic conditions
continue to improve, Tay said.
	   Regional currencies have strengthened markedly since the U.S.
Federal Reserve began trimming interest rates in late September,
which triggered an 18 percent slide in the dollar's value against
the yen.
	   Interest rates in the region have also been falling.
	   But there is concern that negative interest rates _ rates below
the level of inflation _ would discourage people from putting money
in banks at a time of crisis.
	   The bankers said, however, that the risk that negative interest
rates will cause capital flight is minimal as long as the Federal
Reserve is prepared to cut lending rates further to limit the
impact of the Asian crisis on the U.S. economy.
	   There was a consensus among the bankers that non-performing
loans remain a major problem and the banking industry can expect
further consolidation.
	   They said they were unsure what to do about ``strategic''
non-performing loans in which borrowers have the ability to pay
interest, but don't.
	   Many believed it is more productive for debtors and creditors to
solve problems themselves.
	   ``If both sides can agree (on debt restructuring), that's much
better than going to court. If we have to go to court, that means
restructuring has failed and we've wasted time,'' said Banthoon
Lamsam, chairman of the Thai Bankers Association.
	   The methods that banks have used to restructure loans include
reducing lending rates for specific borrowers, extending loan
maturities and swapping debt for equity. In some cases, banks have
agreed to write off part of non-performing loans just so they are
less burdened with increasing loan-loss reserves.
	   But Banthoon also stressed the importance of improving
bankruptcy laws to international standards and the establishment of
a foreclosure law in Thailand to lessen the time creditors and
debtors spend on legal proceedings.
	   With many banks in the region weakening, Ng Kee Choe of
Development Bank of Singapore and chairman of the Association of
Banks in Singapore, said he sees a trend toward consolidation among
banks ``with or without government intervention.
	   ``If a financial institution is weak, there are two options. One
is to nationalize. ... Another option is acquisition,'' he said.

Japan's central bank chief says bad debts stifling recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prospects for economic recovery remain
bleak, and bad debts at financial institutions threaten further
harm to employment and incomes, Japan's central bank chief said
Monday.
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told a meeting of the central
bank's branch managers that an immediate return to economic growth
in Japan is ``difficult.''
	   He said the mountain of bad loans at banks is stifling lending
and causing companies to reduce investment, putting downward
pressure on incomes and employment.
	   Hayami urged Japanese banks to take advantage of banking reform
bills enacted last week that aim to pump funds into the tottering
financial system and open up credit lines to cash-starved
companies.
	   ``Through these measures, I expect that Japan's financial system
will be stabilized and strengthened, thereby contributing to the
economic recovery,'' Hayami said.
	   Many banks, however, are reportedly reluctant to apply for
government help because doing so could call public attention to
their financial woes and expose past mismanagement to government
scrutiny.
	   Japan's banks are saddled with an estimated dlrs 1 trillion in
bad debts left over from excessive lending during the 1980s.

More typhoid reported in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More cases of typhoid have been reported in the
southern Russian region of Dagestan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Monday.
	   Twenty-six people, including eight children, have been
hospitalized with symptoms of the disease, ITAR-Tass said, quoting
the press office of the Ministry for Emergencies.
	   Twenty-one confirmed cases have been reported, it said.
	   The outbreak was blamed on sewage getting into the water system,
it said.
	   Dozens were sickened by typhoid in Dagestan this summer.
	   Typhoid is an extremely infectious disease caused by ingesting
dirty food or water. It is characterized by fever and intestinal
disorders.

Dagestan offers help to fight kidnappings in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Leaders in the southern Russian region of Dagestan
offered Monday to help combat hostage-taking in neighboring
Chechnya, a day after the top anti-kidnapping official in the
breakaway republic was killed by a bomb.
	   The Interior Ministry in Dagestan offered round-the-clock
assistance to their Chechen colleagues, the Interior Ministry press
department said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. It gave no
other details.
	   The offer comes after the killing of Shadid Bargishev, who had
played a role in the release of a number of hostages recently from
Chechnya. He was fatally injured when a remote-controlled bomb
ripped through his car Sunday in the Chechen capital of Grozny.
	   Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
promise to launch an all-out offensive against hostage-takers, and
his recent success in securing the release of several captives,
among them a British couple and 24 Russian soldiers.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also
been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in
Chechnya.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.

	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Commercial bankers from Southeast
Asia believe the region's economic crisis has crested, and expect
currency exchange rates to continue to stabilize and interest rates

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy will probably have zero
growth in 1999, after shrinking in the last two quarters of this
year, deputy prime minister and Monetary Authority chairman Lee
Hsien Loong said in an interview released Monday.
	   Lee did not predict, as many international analysts have done,
that Singapore would fall into a full recession next year, for the
first time since 1985-86. But he left open the possibility. Growth
next year ``could be slightly positive or slightly negative,'' he
said.
	   Recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative
Gross Domestic Product.
	   Singapore's economy is clearly shrinking dramatically, with
growth at 1.6 in the second quarter of this year, down from 6.1
percent in the first quarter.
	   Lee revealed in the interview with Dow Jones Newswires that when
a government package to cut business costs is released next month,
it will include trims in employers' mandatory contributions to the
state-run pension system.
	   But he said any cut in the 26 percent corporate tax rate would
be slight, since the government's target is 25 percent.
	   After 1997 growth of 7.8 percent, Singapore's government is
still officially projecting growth of 0.5 to 1.5 percent for this
year.
	   ``Chances are that we will fall within the range of the official
forecast, but we're not absolutely sure,'' Lee said. ``As for an
informal guess, I would say probably around zero'' growth in 1999.
	   He then said the third and fourth quarters would likely show
contractions from the same periods in 1997.
	   During the last Singapore recession, the government cut
mandatory contributions to the pension system, the Central
Provident Fund, in early 1986 and the economy began to grow again
by the end of the year.
	   Employers and employees each contribute 20 percent of an
employee's gross salary to the employee's pension account.
	   Lee said a cut will definitely be part of the package, aimed at
improving Singapore's competitiveness against its neighbors during
the Asian economic crisis.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nikko Securities, one of Japan's ``Big Three''
brokerages, last week fired one-third of its Singapore staff, or
eight out of 24 employees, a company official said Monday.
	   The cuts are in line with reductions by other international
financial institutions. The volatility of the global markets
frightens investors, who are trading less, bringing fewer deals to
the brokerages.
	   Those dismissed by Nikko were back office and sales personnel,
Dow Jones Newswires reported. The company official, who was not
identified, did not say what day the dismissals were carried out.
	   Nikko Securities last Thursday reported a loss of 57.72 billion
yen (dlrs 491 million), for the six-month period ending Sept. 30.
It said revenues fell at European, Asian and U.S. operations.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prospects for economic recovery remain
bleak, and bad debts at financial institutions threaten further
harm to employment and incomes, Japan's central bank chief said
Monday.
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told a meeting of the central
bank's branch managers that an immediate return to economic growth
in Japan is ``difficult.''
	   He said the mountain of bad loans at banks is stifling lending
and causing companies to reduce investment, putting downward
pressure on incomes and employment.
	   Hayami urged Japanese banks to take advantage of banking reform
bills enacted last week that aim to pump funds into the tottering
financial system and open up credit lines to cash-starved
companies.
	   ``Through these measures, I expect that Japan's financial system
will be stabilized and strengthened, thereby contributing to the
economic recovery,'' Hayami said.
	   Many banks, however, are reportedly reluctant to apply for
government help because doing so could call public attention to
their financial woes and expose past mismanagement to government
scrutiny.
	   Japan's banks are saddled with an estimated dlrs 1 trillion in
bad debts left over from excessive lending during the 1980s.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ There is little prospect of the
Philippine government launching a planned global bond issue until
the first quarter of next year, and it may dispense with the bonds
entirely if it can raise the funds from multilateral lending
agencies, an official said Monday.
	   The Philippines postponed a dlrs 500 million bond issue in
September because of a rise in interest rates for developing
countries triggered by the Russian debt crisis. The bonds were to
be used to help fund a budget deficit, but the government has since
tapped a dlrs 600 million loan from a consortium of banks.
	   ``I don't see any resumption in the issue until the first
quarter of next year,'' Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said.
	   He said the government has considerable leeway in deciding
whether to proceed with the bond issue, and noted that conditions
in the global capital market are still not favorable.
	   The government had planned to raise at least dlrs 500 million in
a two-phase bond issue involving a global U.S. dollar-denominated
floating-rate bond and a Euro-denominated fixed rate bond.
	   Diokno reiterated that the government's plans to rely chiefly on
foreign borrowing to help fund the expected budget deficit of 40
billion pesos (dlrs 950 million) to ease pressures on domestic
interest rates.
	   He indicated that the government may dispense with the bonds
altogether if borrowing from multilateral agencies, such as the
Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, can be accelerated.
	   The government is in various stages of talks with multilateral
and bilateral financial institutions for loans totaling dlrs 1.7
billion which are to be tapped over the next two to three years.
	   This year, the government expects to tap dlrs 225 million from
the Manila-based ADB and a further dlrs 110 million from the World
Bank.

Youth violence causes new transit strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers remained on strike in Marseille,
Lille and Chambery on Monday to protest youth attacks that have
plagued public transportation in many French cities, officials
said.
	   Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the
southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout,
officials said. The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked
on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
	   Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille
bus drivers, who began returning to work Monday. But employee
representatives said they would halt service after each attack in
France's second-largest city.
	   Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the
northern city of Lille and for a 10th day in the Alpine city of
Chambery.
	   Transit workers have demanded that the government put more
police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the
violence.
	   The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from
working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit
unemployment rate. While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the
rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods.

Japanese couple faced with new swindling charges in poisoning case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese couple already charged with attempted
murder and fraud in a poisoning case faced additional charges
Monday of swindling some 137 million yen (dlrs 1.16 million) from
insurance companies.
	   The two originally were arrested Oct. 4 on suspicion of serving
a man arsenic-laced food in September 1997 in an effort to obtain
129 million yen (dlrs 1.1 million) in insurance on his life. The
man, who has not been identified, spent nearly five months in a
hospital. Police say the
	   Police also have been investigating a mass poisoning in the same
area in July, when four people, including two children, died after
eating curry laced with arsenic.
	   No arrests have been made in the curry poisoning, which set off
a series of apparently copycat poisonings in Japan, including the
death of a man who drank a can of tea bought at a supermarket in
Suzaka, central Japan. That drink was later found to have been
laced with cyanide.
	   The couple _ Masumi Hayashi, a 37-year-old former insurance
saleswoman, and her husband, Kenji Hayashi, 53 _ were served new
arrest warrants Monday.
	   These allege that they swindled four insurance companies out of
137 million yen (dlrs 1.16 million) in disability insurance
benefits in 1997 by falsely claiming that Kenji had lost the use of
his limbs.
	   The latest warrants also allege that Mrs. Hayashi tried again on
March 28 to murder the same man, by serving him noodles tainted
with arsenic at the couple's home, said Mikiya Miyamoto, spokesman
for the prefectural police in Wakayama, 453 kilometers (281 miles)
southwest of Tokyo.
	   He was found to be suffering from arsenic poisoning when he was
taken to the hospital the next day after a motorcycle accident.
	   Miyamoto quoted Mrs. Hayashi as telling investigators she ``does
not want to answer'' the latest charges, while her husband was
quoted as saying he ``does not know'' about the cases.
	   The couple have denied all previous charges, police said.
	   Meanwhile, lawyers for the couple criticized investigators
Monday, saying the new arrest warrants on separate charges were
intended to help obtain confessions by prolonging the couple's
detention period, Kyodo News said.

Hong Kong share prices close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly lower
Monday as some investors took profits following recent sharp gains.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 38.84 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 9,778.91. On Friday,
the index had gained 159.17 points.
	   Turnover fell to 5.25 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 673
million) from Friday's 6.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
883 million).
	   ``There was some profit-taking and people were not quite
interested in buying stocks,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at
Sassoon Securities Ltd.
	   Brokers said the profit-taking was expected after the index had
surged 25 percent so far this month.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 3.50 Hong Kong dollars to
178.50, Hang Seng Bank fell 1.00 dollar to 65.75, and Swire Pacific
``A'' fell 40 cents to 32.60.
	   Among gainers, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.10 dollars to
46.10, and Hutchison Whampoa rose 75 cents to 51.75.

Head of Asian Rugby Football Union to step down over tournament
</HEADLINE>
row &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The head of the Asian Rugby Football Union will
step down from his post because of a tournament squabble involving
Thailand during this week's rugby championships, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   Decho Sariputra, who is a Thai and secretary-general of the
regulatory body, at first banned the Thais from the Asian Rugby
Championships when they refused Oct. 24 to play against Singapore.
He reinstated them a day later.
	   The controversy has overshadowed the tournament.
	   The Asian Rugby Football Union is due to elect officers on
Saturday, when Decho will relinquish his post after six consecutive
terms.
	   ``As secretary-general, I'm responsible. It is a disaster. ...
As such, I am not seeking re-election,'' Decho was quoted as saying
by The New Paper.
	   Thailand had objected to Singapore fielding four non-citizens,
despite a pre-tournament ballot by nine participating nations to
allow the city-state to use them on the squad.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia voted against the move, but
then agreed to abide by the majority decision. At least until the
tournament began, it appears.
	   On Oct. 24, Decho condemned Thailand's forfeit, saying it
``cannot pick and choose who it wants to play against.'' But
following a long and heated discussion between officials and
managers Sunday, he reversed his stance.
	   In a press release issued Monday, Decho said Thailand is willing
to remain in the competition and the tournament will proceed ``in
its present state,'' with Singapore's four non-citizens playing and
Thailand's forfeit standing.
	   ``To save further embarrassment to the tournament, the countries
have taken an undertaking that there will be no more forfeits or
walkovers for the rest of this tournament,'' his statement added.

Myanmar army deploying new assault rifle, ethnic rebels say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAE HONG SON, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military has deployed a
new, locally assembled assault weapon, the commander of an armed
ethnic rebel group said.
	   The weapon, known to the rebels as the MA-1, was first spotted
by rebel groups in April 1998, and his group obtained some earlier
this month from four defectors, said Lt. Gen. Aung Mya, a commander
of the military wing of the Karenni National Progressive Party.
	   He described the weapon as looking like the Chinese version of
the famous AK-47 assault rifle, but incorporating aspects of other
light infantry weapons.
	   The weapon appears to be the same one described by the
authoritative military magazine Jane's Defense Weekly in July. It
reported that Myanmar had begun manufacturing small arms at a
prefabricated factory designed and built by Chartered Industries of
Singapore in conjunction with Israeli consultants.
	   Jane's said the first weapon being produced at the factory was
believed to be the EMERK-1, a locally designed weapon that could be
configured as either an assault rifle or a light machine gun.
	   The KNPP's Aung Mya said the MA-1 had been issued to government
troops guarding the Yadana pipeline that transports natural gas
from Myanmar, also known as Burma, to Thailand. Jane's made a
similar claim for the EMERK-1.
	   Other areas where the weapons have been spotted are Shan State,
Karen State and Kayin State, particularly around the Thai border
area where there are ethnic rebel strongholds, said Chao-ood
Kaysee, the vice secretary of the Shan United Revolutionary Army,
another rebel group.
	   Both rebel leaders said they will learn the effectiveness of the
new weapons soon when the rainy season ends and government troops
are expected to increase their attacks.
	   Myanmar's military government has made cease-fire agreements
with more than a dozen ethnic groups that had been rebelling
against the central government for decades, but some groups have
held out and others are disgruntled.

Moody's may downgrade eight Japanese life insurers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In its latest vote of no confidence for corporate
Japan, Moody's Investors Service said Monday it may lower the
credit ratings of eight Japanese life insurance companies.
	   Moody's said it is reviewing its assessment of the
creditworthiness of the companies _ among Japan's largest financial
companies _ because declining stock prices likely eroded the value
of their massive equity portfolios.
	   If the U.S.-based rating agency downgrades the eight insurers,
that could drive up their cost of raising money by making them
appear a greater risk in the eyes of investors.
	   Earlier downgrades of Japanese banks and other finance companies
by Moody's have forced them to lure investors to their bonds and
other securities with higher rates of interest.
	   None of the eight are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Most
are mutual companies, meaning they are legally private companies
owned by their policy holders.
	   The eight include Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co., Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life Insurance Co., Taiyo Mutual Life Insurance Co., Fukoku
Mutual Life Insurance Co., Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance Co., Asahi
Mutual Life Insurance Co., Tokyo Mutual Life Insurance Co. and
Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.

Leading liberal lawmaker confident of winning Russian presidency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky said
he is confident of winning the next presidential elections without
forging a coalition with any other political force.
	   ``We will not give away the Russian presidency to anyone,''
Yavlinsky said, referring to his Yabloko faction in parliament.
	   ``We plan our strategy so as to run on our own in the
presidential and parliamentary elections,'' he said on Russian NTV
television on Sunday night. ``We aren't envisaging any coalition.''
	   Yavlinsky, 46 finished fourth in the 1996 presidential
elections. He has remained one of Russia's leading politicians, but
trails other potential contenders in public opinion polls. The next
presidential election is scheduled for sometime in 2000.
	   A nationwide poll of 1,500 people conducted on Oct. 17-18 by the
respected Public Opinion Foundation, had Yavlinsky ranked fourth
with the support of eight percent of respondents, behind Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Krasnoyarsk
Gov. Alexander Lebed.
	   The NTV ``Itogi'' current affairs program, which carried the
poll, did not give its margin of error.
	   Yavlinsky shrugged off the poll results, saying it's too early
to discuss such numbers and expressing confidence that Russians
would support his policies.
	   Yavlinsky said he had fully recuperated after a mild heart
attack he suffered on Sept. 18. He spent three weeks in a Moscow
hospital and one week in Germany for additional treatment before
returning to work Oct. 19.
	   Yavlinsky said he would not join other politicians calling for
the early resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, saying that
``everything must proceed within the framework of the constitution
and the law.''
	   Yeltsin has said he will not seek a third term in 2000.

Philippine stocks surge on stronger peso; index up 4.1 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks finished sharply
higher Monday, although below their highs for the day, on the
peso's continuing appreciation and expectations of a further
softening of domestic interest rates, traders said.
	   The peso came close to testing the key level of 41.50 pesos per
dollar. For the day, the dollar averaged 41.806 pesos, down from
Friday's 42.245 pesos, on strong dollar inflows to the stock market
and remittances from Filipinos working abroad, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 62.42 points,
or 4.1 percent, to 1,586.40 after gaining 29.36 points Friday.
	   The index had soared by as much as 107.76 points, or 7.1
percent, to 1,631.74 in Monday trading before profit-taking
emerged.
	   The broader All Shares Index was up 17.55 points to 518.26 after
gaining 13.61 points Friday. Gainers outnumbered losers 100 to 19,
with 26 stocks unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. led the most active
stocks because of renewed talk of a possible takeover bid. Its
shares rose 65 pesos to 930 pesos.
	   Metro Pacific Corp., whose parent company, Hong Kong-based First
Pacific Group, is rumored to be close to sealing a deal for a
substantial stake in PLDT, rose 12 centavos to 1.08 pesos.
	   Analysts had expected the market to succumb to profit-taking
Monday after several days of gains, interrupted only by a slight
correction last Wednesday.
	   ``We're pleasantly surprised. It seems all the right ingredients
are here,'' said Cilette Liboro, research head at Orion Squire
Securities, referring to the stronger peso and declining interest
rates.
	   The peso's steady appreciation is expected to help drive
interest rates lower. Just last week, the central bank reduced its
key overnight rates by a quarter-percentage point.
	   Interest rates have been the central bank's main weapon in
efforts to quell speculative attacks on the peso.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said foreign
brokerage houses led the buying spree Monday, an apparent
indication that foreign investors' sentiment is improving.
	   In currency trading, a trader with a foreign bank said overseas
Filipino workers, fearing a further appreciation of the peso, have
started remitting part of their earnings early this year. Generally
the largest amount of money is sent home before Christmas.
	   Millions of Filipinos work overseas, and their foreign-exchange
remittances provide an important contribution to the Philippine
economy.
	   A trader said he believes the peso will continue to strengthen
over the coming days.
	   The peso also has been underpinned by the stable Japanese yen,
which has also benefited other regional currencies.

Dagestan offers help to fight kidnappings in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS accusation of Russian prosecutor in 6th graf.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Leaders in the southern Russian region of Dagestan
offered Monday to help combat hostage-taking in neighboring
Chechnya, a day after the top anti-kidnapping official in the
breakaway republic was killed by a bomb.
	   The Interior Ministry in Dagestan offered round-the-clock
assistance to their Chechen colleagues, the Interior Ministry press
department said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. It gave no
other details.
	   The offer comes after the killing of Shadid Bargishev, who had
played a role in the release of a number of hostages recently from
Chechnya. He was fatally injured when a remote-controlled bomb
ripped through his car Sunday in the Chechen capital of Grozny.
	   Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
promise to launch an all-out offensive against hostage-takers, and
his recent success in securing the release of several captives,
among them a British couple and 24 Russian soldiers.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   Chechnya's first deputy security minister, Abu Movsayev, said
Monday that the Russian military may have been behind the killing.
Bargishev had recently challenged a claim by the Russian prosecutor
general's office that it had freed the Russian servicemen from
captivity, Movsayev said.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also
been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in
Chechnya.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.

Netanyahu says he won't apologize for playing Pollard card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
that he will not apologize for pushing for the release of Israeli
spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. prison in the final moments of
last week's Mideast summit.
	   Netanyahu was harshly attacked at home for linking the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians to the release of
Pollard, a move that delayed the festive signing for several hours
and reportedly infuriated Clinton administration officials.
	   Asked to comment on those reports, Netanyahu told Israel army
radio Monday: ``Not only will I not apologize. I am proud that I
stand up for him (Pollard) and I will continue to do so.''
	   Netanyahu said he was confident he will eventually win the
release of Pollard who is serving a life term in the United States
for spying for Israel.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst who was
granted Israeli citizenship earlier this year, has been in prison
since 1985. He handed classified U.S. military documents to Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Israel had a moral obligation to try and get
Pollard released.
	   ``The man worked for us and our security,'' Netanyahu said. ``He
made a mistake. He should not have done what he did and Israel made
a mistake by doing what it did against the United States. But he
has been paying the price for 13 years and we need to get him out
of there.''
	   Netanyahu denied press reports that he sprung the Pollard card
on Clinton during the last day of summit negotiations. He said he
pressed for Pollard's release throughout the talks.
	   In the end, Clinton promised to review the Pollard case, but
emphasized he was making no promises regarding the outcome.
	   Netanyahu said this in itself was an achievement.
	   ``I heard the response of President Clinton who for the first
time said that he would look into the matter seriously. This is
something no president has ever said before.''

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Aborigine has been elected to the
Australian Parliament for the first time in 15 years and only the
second time ever, latest counting for the Oct. 3 national poll
showed Monday.
	   Australian Electoral Commission figures show lawyer and land
rights activist Aden Ridgeway has won a place in the Senate for the
state of New South Wales.
	   Claiming victory, Ridgeway said he would devote himself to
achieving reconciliation between black and white Australians and
the forging of ``new national identity for the new millennium.''
	   He said he hoped for progress on reconciliation before the
Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and Australia's centenary of federation
in 2001.
	   Ridgeway is a candidate for the left-of-center Australian
Democrats party, which the figures released Monday show will hold
the balance of power in the Senate, where Prime Minister John
Howard's conservative government failed to win a majority.
	   The results come so long after the Oct. 3 election because of
complex and time-consuming vote-counting procedures.
	   Earlier this month, Ridgeway said a victory for him would be ``a
moral victory for indigenous Australians.''
	   The only other Aborigine elected to parliament is Neville
Bonner, who was a senator in Howard's party, the Liberals, from
1972-1983.
	   Ridgeway's election follows a damaged relationship between
Aborigines and Howard's government and the rise of the right-wing
politician Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, which has been
criticized as racist for comments against Aborigines and Asian
migrants.
	   Howard has angered Aboriginal leaders with new laws to restrict
Aborigines' rights to claim a limited form of title to some
government-leased land, and by his refusal to apologize on behalf
of the nation for past government policies that saw about 100,000
Aboriginal children separated from their families on the basis of
race.
	   ``The fabric of Australian society has been torn in the last
three years, particularly the rise of One Nation, and I think that
they're the things that ought to be repaired,'' Ridgeway said.
	   Ridgeway, 35, was born on New South Wales' north coast to a
Scotswoman who survived a shipwreck on her way to Australia and a
leader of the Gumbayynggir tribe. He was raised as a Catholic on a
mission before he moved to Sydney at age 10.
	   In a profile in The Sydney Morning Herald in August, Ridgeway
recalled being segregated from whites at the local cinema and being
shunned by students at school in Sydney.
	   He became a park ranger and worked as a public servant before
becoming a lawyer, executive director of the state Aboriginal Land
Council and a member of the National Indigenous Working Group,
which lobbied the government on its native title laws.
	   Under Australia's electoral law, Ridgeway and the 39 other
senators elected in the October poll will not replace sitting
members until July 1.
	   With the Democrats holding the balance of power, the government
will be forced to negotiate some bills to have them passed.

Serb troop movements as NATO measures compliance with peace deal
</HEADLINE>

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles were
reported rumbling down Kosovo's roads Monday as the government
sought to convince NATO it is trying to meet the deadline for
complying with the peace deal to avoid airstrikes.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors were hearing a briefing
Monday from the alliance's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark, on
his weekend talks in Belgrade, where he pressed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said in Washington that Clark
``made clear the need for significant compliance on the ground by
Tuesday.'' That is NATO's latest deadline for Milosevic to comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis without airstrikes.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the government's Serb Media
Center said three military units were returning to their barracks
Monday in the towns of Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
who fled the fighting can return to their homes safely.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying the with
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim Serb-led forces
withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return after they
leave to harass civilians.
	   On Sunday, mourners ran away or dived for cover when gunfire
whistled overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence wouldn't protect
the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind the mountain village Krajkova,
30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina.
	   His father, Rashit Elshani, blamed Serb police, saying his son
died simply because he's Albanian. Police have been shooting in the
area every night to try to scare off villagers, he said. Serb
officials were unavailable for comment.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about 1,000 meters (yards) away, the same
area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several times after
the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   On Sunday, President Clinton, while on a fund-raising trip in
California, spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair about the need to keep the pressure on
Milosevic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''

Head of Asian Rugby Football Union to step down over tournament

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The head of the Asian Rugby Football Union said
Monday he will step down from his post because of a tournament
squabble involving Thailand during this week's rugby championships.
	   Decho Sariputra, who is a Thai and secretary-general of the
regulatory body, at first banned the Thais from the Asian Rugby
Championships when they refused Oct. 24 to play against Singapore.
He reinstated them a day later.
	   The controversy has overshadowed the tournament and Decho
acknowledged, ``I failed to get my members together.''
	   Thailand had objected to Singapore fielding four non-citizens,
despite a pre-tournament ballot by nine participating nations to
allow the city-state to use them on the squad.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia voted against the move, but
then agreed to abide by the majority decision. At least until the
tournament began, it appears.
	   The Asian Rugby Football Union is due to elect officers on
Saturday, when Decho will relinquish his post after six consecutive
one-year terms.
	   ``I was hoping to do two more, but that is not a question now,''
Decho said in an emotional news conference.
	   ``I'm not going to stand for re-election,'' he said, adding that
he had enough support to win if he did. ``I'm not blowing my
trumpet, but I've tried my best for Asia.''
	   `` This is an honorary position, by the way,'' he said. ``It
really should go to a professional guy, but we can't afford to pay.
We don't have the money.''
	   On Oct. 24, Decho condemned Thailand's forfeit, saying it
``cannot pick and choose who it wants to play against.'' But
following a long and heated discussion between officials and
managers Sunday, he reversed his stance.
	   In a press release issued Monday, Decho said Thailand is willing
to remain in the competition and the tournament will proceed ``in
its present state,'' with Singapore's four non-citizens playing and
Thailand's forfeit standing.
	   ``To save further embarrassment to the tournament, the countries
have taken an undertaking that there will be no more forfeits or
walkovers for the rest of this tournament,'' his statement added.

33-year-old looks to Bangkok games for last glory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Twenty years ago, a shy, 13-year-old
bucktooth girl with a pigtail took many of India's athletic pundits
by surprise.
	   Payyoli Tevaraparampil Usha won gold in the 100 meters, 80-meter
hurdles, 4x100-meter relay and long jump. She wanted to compete in
more events, but officials at the under-14 Indian National
Athletics Champions told her to give others a chance.
	   Now the woman known as India's ``sprint queen'' is looking to
stun the world again at the Asian Games, which kick off in Bangkok
in December.
	   Usha reigned supreme for more than a decade. During the 1982 New
Delhi Asian Games, she won silver in the 100 meters and 200 meters.
A year later, she won gold in her favorite 400 meters in the Asian
Track and Field meet in Kuwait. She also bagged a silver in the 200
meters.
	   At the New Delhi Asian Track and Field meet in 1989, she won
gold in the 200 meters, 400 meters, 400-meter hurdles and
4x400-meter hurdles. Her 23.27 seconds in the 200 that year is
still India's national record.
	   Then came the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, where she failed to win
a single medal. At an age when many runners have long since
retired, 33-year-old Usha is looking at the forthcoming Asian Games
at Bangkok for her last glory.
	   ``I will definitely win gold,'' Usha said in a recent interview.
	   Taking everyone by surprise, Usha came out of her self-imposed
retirement and took part in the Asian Track Championship meet in
Fukuoka, Japan last July. She anchored India's 4x100-meter relay
team to a gold, led her country's silver medal team in the 4x400,
and earned an individual bronze in the 200 meters.
	   ``I'm more than happy,'' Usha told The Associated Press then.
``Hopefully I'll be better fit and run faster in the Asian Games.''
	   In Bangkok, Usha will run in the 200 meters and may try the 400,
as well as the 4x400 and 4x100 relays.
	   Usha stands out in a country of 980 million people that has
produced surprisingly few runners able to compete at the
international level.
	   No Indian has won a medal in an Olympic track or field event. It
was Usha who came closest to an Olympics medal when she missed the
bronze by 0.01 seconds in 1994.
	   One year after going into what turned out to be a short-lived
retirement in 1991, Usha married S. Sreenivasan, also an athlete
who plays the traditional Indian tag-like game of kabbadi. He
brought her back to the track and became her coach.
	   The couple has a 6-year-old son, Ujwal.

Four South Koreans indicted in alleged plot with North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A former head of South Korea's
intelligence agency and three others were indicted Monday in an
alleged plot to get North Korea to stage a brief border skirmish to
sway the result of last year's presidential election.
	   Former presidential aide Oh Jong-eun and businessmen Han Sung-ki
and Chang Sok-jung were indicted on charges of illegally contacting
and meeting North Korean officials.
	   Kwon Young-hae, former head of the Agency for National Security
Planning, was indicted on a charge of dereliction of duty in not
investigating the case.
	   If convicted, each of the four could receive up to 10 years in
prison.
	   Kwon is already serving a five-year prison term after being
convicted in a separate plot to destroy President Kim Dae-jung's
election campaign last year by depicting him as a communist.
	   Prosecutors said the other three intended to help the campaign
of Lee Hoi-chang, the then ruling party's candidate to succeed
outgoing President Kim Young-sam. They said the president's aide
was the ringleader.
	   The two businessmen met North Korean officials in Beijing eight
days before the presidential election and asked them to provoke a
brief gun fight with South Korean troops at the truce village of
Panmunjom, prosecutors said.
	   In return, the three allegedly promised the famine-stricken
nation a large amount of food and fertilizer if Lee won the
election.
	   North Korea declined the offer, and President Kim eventually won
the Dec. 18 election by a margin of 300,000 votes, or less than 1
percent.
	   Prosecutors said Kwon learned of the plot as agency officials
looked into the matter, but did not order a formal investigation.
	   Since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, military threats from
North Korea, either real or rumored, have sent voters rallying
around the conservative ruling party.
	   Under national security laws, South Koreans are not allowed to
meet North Koreans unless they have government approval, which is
rarely given.

Taliban launch inquiry into charges of terrorism against bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, ADDS three end grafs about fighting in northern
Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The leader of Afghanistan's Taliban
army has launched a judicial inquiry into allegations of terrorism
against Osama bin Laden, a spokesman said Monday.
	   ``The whole world is accusing bin Laden of terrorism, but we are
saying he is not involved in this,'' said Abdul Hai Muttmayan, a
Taliban spokesman reached by satellite telephone at his
headquarters in southern Kandahar. ``We have given power to the
Supreme Court inquiry to hear evidence against Osama from anywhere
in the world.''
	   The inquiry was set up by a decree issued by Mullah Mohammed
Omar, the Taliban's reclusive leader and self-declared Amir
ul-Momineen or leader of the Muslim faithful.
	   The United States charges bin Laden masterminded the deadly
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa in August that killed
more than 200 people and wounded thousands others.
	   Bin Laden, a millionaire Saudi Arabian, was exiled from his
homeland after threatening to overthrow the Saudi monarchy for
allowing U.S. soldiers to be stationed in Saudi Arabia, home to
Islam's two holiest sites at Mecca and Medina.
	   ``After the attacks in East Africa, this propaganda against
Osama has become more severe . . . we have clarified that Osama was
not involved in these blasts,'' said Muttmayan. ``But there are
still allegations against him so we feel we should clear up the
whole situation.''
	   The Supreme Court judicial inquiry will be headed by the
Taliban's Chief Justice Mullah Noor Mohammed Saqib, a graduate of
one of Pakistan's largest religious schools, Dar-ul Aloom Haqqania.
	   On Aug. 20 the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan aimed at suspected terrorist camps belonging to
bin Laden.
	   While the death toll has varied, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers
say 26 people were killed, including several Pakistanis belonging
to Harakat-ul Ansar an Islamic group on Washington's list of
terrorist organizations.
	   Muttmayan said the inquiry also will investigate the killings in
August of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The killings sent already poor relations into a tailspin and
Tehran deployed more than 200,000 soldiers on its border with
Afghanistan threatening to take revenge for the death of its
nationals.
	   The United Nations sent its special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to the
region to soothe tempers and defuse tensions, something he
accomplished after a visit to Tehran and southern Kandahar, where
he was the first U.N. envoy to meet Omar.
	   Muttmayan said the inquiry will compile evidence in both cases
and decide whether charges will be laid.
	   If charges are laid, Muttmayan said a trial would be held in
Afghanistan in keeping with Islamic laws, imposed throughout the 90
percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban.
	   Meanwhile, there were reports of heavy fighting in northern
Afghanistan between the Taliban and their opponents who control the
remaining three percent.
	   According to opposition sources there was heavy fighting in Imam
Sahab, near Afghanistan's northern border with Tajikistan. The
Taliban were still in control of the area, but according to the
opposition dozens of people have been killed.
	   In the Afghan capital, eyewitnesses said dozens of fighter jets
have taken off from the combined military and civilian airport
apparently heading north toward the front line areas.

	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   On Sunday, President Clinton, while on a fund-raising trip in
California, spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair about the need to keep the pressure on
Milosevic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''

Philippines' House of Representatives OKs dlrs 13.8 billion budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with budget secretary saying budget could be approved
in December, officials proposing accord with Congress to allow
faster approval in new grafs 9-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' House of
Representatives passed on second reading Monday a 579 billion peso
(dlrs 13.8 billion) national budget for 1999.
	   House Speaker Manuel Villar described the budget as
``pro-poor,'' noting that basic services were given substantial
allotments.
	   The Education Department received the biggest slice of the
budget, at around 81 billion pesos (dlrs 1.9 billion), or 14
percent of the total.
	   The Defense Department and the Public Works Department took the
next biggest allocations, at around 52 billion pesos (dlrs 1.2
billion) and 37 billion pesos (dlrs 880 million) respectively.
	   The budget will have to go through a third and final reading
before it is considered formally adopted by the lower chamber.
However, the third reading is usually a formality, and the budget
is likely to be passed by the House as it was presented in the
second reading, a spokesman said.
	   The budget also must be approved by the Senate, where some
lawmakers believe more money should go to agriculture.
	   The Agriculture Department's allocation currently is about 16
billion pesos (dlrs 380 million), or 3 percent of the budget.
	   ``There are suggestions that we allocate more money for
agriculture projects like farm-to-market roads,'' said
Representative Florencio Abad.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said he expects the budget will
be finally approved by Congress in December.
	   He said the administration has proposed an arrangement in which
legislators would be involved in the preparation of the budget so
it can be approved faster by Congress in the future.
	   Congress is not currently involved in budget preparations, and
lawmakers usually make many changes to proposed budgets, delaying
their approval. Diokno said administration and congressional
leaders are discussing the proposed arrangement and an agreement
could be reached in December.
	   In such a setup, the executive department could brief
legislators on the state of the economy and where funds are most
needed. Lawmakers then ``could show us the right way,'' Diokno
said.
	   Meanwhile, the traditional large discretionary fund for personal
projects of legislators, locally known as a ``pork barrel'' fund,
has been eliminated in the 1999 budget.
	   In its place is a maximum of 30 million pesos (dlrs 714 million)
that is to be made available to the approximately 210 legislators
for local projects dealing with basic services.
	   Last year, the House of Representatives gave itself some 55
billion pesos (dlrs 1.3 billion) in pork barrel funds under the
1998 national budget. In July, newly elected President Joseph
Estrada ordered that half that amount be withheld.

Youth violence causes new transit strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike on Paris line after attack

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers were on strike in several cities on
Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation across France, officials said.
	   The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille,
Lille and Chambery, officials said.
	   The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the
west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a
train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on
Sunday.
	   A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a fire
extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the driver to
be hospitalized. On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45
minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
	   Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the
southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout,
officials said. The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked
on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
	   Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille
bus drivers, who began returning to work Monday. But employee
representatives said they would halt service after each attack in
France's second-largest city.
	   Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the
northern city of Lille _ France's fourth-largest metropolis _ and
for a 10th day in the Alpine city of Chambery.
	   Transit workers have demanded that the government put more
police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the
violence.
	   The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from
working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit
unemployment rate. While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the
rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods.

Netanyahu says he won't apologize for playing Pollard card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
that he will not apologize for pushing for the release of Israeli
spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. prison in the final moments of
last week's Mideast summit.
	   Netanyahu was severely criticized at home for linking the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians to the release of
Pollard, a move that delayed the festive signing for several hours
and reportedly infuriated Clinton administration officials.
	   Asked to comment on those reports, Netanyahu told Israel army
radio Monday: ``Not only will I not apologize. I am proud that I
stand up for him (Pollard) and I will continue to do so.''
	   Netanyahu said he was confident he will eventually win the
release of Pollard who is serving a life term in the United States
for spying for Israel.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst who was
granted Israeli citizenship earlier this year, has been in prison
since 1985. He handed classified U.S. military documents to Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Israel had a moral obligation to try and get
Pollard released.
	   ``The man worked for us and our security,'' Netanyahu said. ``He
made a mistake. He should not have done what he did and Israel made
a mistake by doing what it did against the United States. But he
has been paying the price for 13 years and we need to get him out
of there.''
	   Netanyahu denied press reports that he sprung the Pollard card
on Clinton during the last day of summit negotiations. He said he
pressed for Pollard's release throughout the talks.
	   In the end, Clinton promised to review the Pollard case, but
emphasized he was making no promises regarding the outcome.
	   Netanyahu said this in itself was an achievement.
	   ``I heard the response of President Clinton who for the first
time said that he would look into the matter seriously. This is
something no president has ever said before.''

Head of Asian Rugby Football Union to step down over tournament
</HEADLINE>
row &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The head of the Asian Rugby Football Union said
Monday he will step down from his post because of a tournament
squabble involving Thailand during this week's rugby championships.
	   Decho Sariputra, who is a Thai and secretary-general of the
regulatory body, at first banned the Thais from the Asian Rugby
Championships when they refused Oct. 24 to play against Singapore.
He reinstated them a day later.
	   The controversy has overshadowed the tournament and Decho
acknowledged, ``I failed to get my members together.''
	   Thailand had objected to Singapore fielding four non-citizens,
despite a pre-tournament ballot by nine participating nations to
allow the city-state to use them on the squad.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia voted against the move, but
then agreed to abide by the majority decision. At least until the
tournament began, it appears.
	   The Asian Rugby Football Union is due to elect officers on
Saturday, when Decho will relinquish his post after six consecutive
one-year terms.
	   ``I was hoping to do two more, but that is not a question now,''
Decho said in an emotional news conference.
	   ``I'm not going to stand for re-election,'' he said, adding that
he had enough support to win if he did. ``I'm not blowing my
trumpet, but I've tried my best for Asia.''
	   `` This is an honorary position, by the way,'' he said. ``It
really should go to a professional guy, but we can't afford to pay.
We don't have the money.''
	   On Oct. 24, Decho condemned Thailand's forfeit, saying it
``cannot pick and choose who it wants to play against.'' But
following a long and heated discussion between officials and
managers Sunday, he reversed his stance.
	   In a press release issued Monday, Decho said Thailand is willing
to remain in the competition and the tournament will proceed ``in
its present state,'' with Singapore's four non-citizens playing and
Thailand's forfeit standing.
	   ``To save further embarrassment to the tournament, the countries
have taken an undertaking that there will be no more forfeits or
walkovers for the rest of this tournament,'' his statement added.

New Miss Croatia chosen in new voting

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Two weeks after a Muslim was proclaimed
Miss Croatia, the contest jury reversed itself and gave the title
to runnerup, Ivana Petkovic.
	   In a somber atmosphere, broadcast live on national television
late Sunday, 12 members of the jury chose Petkovic, while five
voted for Lejla Sehovic, 22.
	   Sehovic left in tears, after she was not allowed to give a
statement.
	   ``I wanted to say that this was a set-up, that the new voting is
a farce,'' Vecernji list daily quoted Sehovic as saying.
	   This year's beauty contest, highly popular among the Croats,
turned into a national scandal, when organizers decided to strip
Sehovic of title, citing voting irregularities.
	   But in the country where many people do not consider Muslims
``real'' Croats, the contest became a political issue. Sehovic,
Croatian media and some human rights organizations charged that she
was ousted just because she's a Muslim.
	   Croatia, which has a small Muslim minority, supported Croats in
neighboring Bosnia during their 1993-4 conflict with Muslims there.
Relations between the two nations remained tense.
	   After the first contest, media reported that a part of the
public and some of the organizers, could not live with the Muslim
representing Croatia at the Miss World contest.
	   The chief organizer, Milan Seckovic, denied politics played a
role in the reversal. He insisted that the first voting was
irregular and turned to the Miss World organizer, Eric Morley, for
advice. Morley recommended new voting.
	   Four members of the jury, who earlier openly supported Sehovic,
refused to appear at Sunday's voting.
	   Without music, fireworks or an audience, Petkovic received the
traditional lace and flowers. She was also left without the crown,
because it is still with Sehovic, who threatens to sue the
organizers.

Police capture 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Three Turkish men were arrested after
customs officers found 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of heroin in a
refrigerated fruit truck headed to Germany, police reported Monday.
	   The truck owned by a Dutch company entered Romania late Sunday
at the southern Danube port of Giurgiu, 70 kilometers (44 miles)
south of Bucharest.
	   ``There were suspicions about this transportation and border
police carried out a thorough search,'' said a statement from the
interior ministry.
	   Customs officers found two travel bags in the drivers cabin
filled with plastic bags containing brown powder which tests showed
was heroin.
	   Three Turkish drivers traveling in the truck told police they
got the bags from another Turk citizen. He gave them the bags in
Istanbul and said they were to be transported to the Netherlands,
they said.
	   Police arrested them and they will be charged with drugs
smuggling, the statement said.
	   Drugs smuggling has increased in recent years, especially after
the war broke out in Yugoslavia in 1991. Romania is a point on the
drugs route from the Middle East and Africa to Western Europe.

Eight more arrested in one-day revolt against Shevardnadze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Shevardnadze's comments, context in new three
final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Police arrested eight more people
accused of being involved in a one-day revolt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia's security minister said Monday.
	   The arrests on Sunday bring to 31 the number of people detained
in connection with the Oct. 19 revolt by mutinous soldiers in
western Georgia, said State Security Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze.
	   The leader, Akakiy Eliava, remains at large. Eliava is a
military commander who supported the late Georgian president, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died under mysterious circumstances in 1994.
His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
	   Shevardnadze, speaking in a radio interview on Monday, said the
revolt might have been staged by unspecified ``foreign secret
services'' conspiring to destabilize Georgia to thwart an
international pipeline project.
	   Georgia is competing with Russia and others for the right to
transport oil from Azerbaijan's rich Caspian Sea oil fields to
Europe. One of the pipelines to carry early oil is being built in
western Georgia, the same region where the mutiny took place.
	   ``Our enemies have been unable to gain the upper hand, and they
never will,'' Shevardnadze said, without mentioning any names.

Sudanese plane reportedly bombs southern Sudan town

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Sudanese air force plane dropped seven
bombs around a hospital in the country's south, killing three
people and damaging a community corn flour mill, a relief official
said Monday.
	   The raid by an Antonov, which had been converted into a bomber,
occurred Friday in Yei, about 120 kilometers (74 miles) southwest
of Juba, said Dan Effie, a spokesman for the Norwegian People's
Aid.
	   The Norwegian humanitarian organization runs the hospital and
the mill, Effie said. The hospital treats civilians, rebels and
government troops captured by the SPLA.
	   ``This is totally a civilian target,'' Effie said. ``Yet they
continually bomb it. ``A person once wounded is no longer a
combatant.''
	   It was the fifth time government planes have bombed Yei since it
was captured by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in March
1997. Effie said the hospital appeared to be the target in every
raid.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the bombing on Friday,
but NPA has in the past provided reliable reports.
	   Juba, a provincial capital about 1,200 kilometers (744 miles)
south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, is the largest town in
southern Sudan still under government control.
	   Government forces and rebels are fighting 72 kilometers (45
miles) east of Juba.
	   The SPLA said its forces on Saturday shot down a Russian-built
MiG 23 fighter of the Sudanese air force near al-Jabalain, 64
kilometers (40 miles) east of Juba, while the jet was on a mission
supporting a government ground attack.
	   On Sunday, the Sudan military said the plane did not fall to
rebel fire but crashed due to a ``technical fault.'' The pilot died
in the crash, the command said.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for autonomy from the
Muslim and Arab-dominated north for southern Sudan where Christians
and followers of traditional religion form the majority. The rebels
have never been able to capture Juba, a strategic goal in their
campaign.

Two Ukrainian miners killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two miners were killed in Ukraine's
crumbling coal mines over the weekend, bringing to at least 305 the
number of coal industry workers who have died on the job so far
this year, officials said Monday.
	   One miner died at the Stashkova mine in the southeastern
Dnipropetrovsk region due to an unspecified violation of safety
rules, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Another miner was killed by falling pieces of rock at the
Komsomolets Donbasa mine in eastern Donetsk region.
	   Work and safety conditions at the former Soviet republic's coal
mines have deteriorated in recent years as the cash-strapped
government has failed to provide sufficient funds to support the
largely unreformed industry.
	   With practically no money allocated for modernizing equipment
and improving safety conditions at the underground coal shafts, the
number of Ukrainian miners killed on the job has been steadily
rising.

Alan Sainsbury, supermarket pioneer, dead at 96
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alan Sainsbury, who pioneered supermarkets in
Britain and who helped build a family grocery empire, has died. He
was 96.
	   Lord Sainsbury, made a life peer in 1962, died Oct. 21 at his
home in Toppesfield, a village in Essex county, east of London.
Cause of death was not announced.
	   The family business, founded by his grandparents in 1869 with a
single shop in London, was already successful when Alan Sainsbury
was born Aug. 13, 1902. He was instrumental in transforming the
business into a giant retailer which now has nearly 400 stores and
sales of 11.6 billion pounds (nearly dlrs 20 billion) a year.
	   Sent by the government after World War II to investigate food
retailing innovations in the United States, Sainsbury returned home
with what was then a revolutionary concept _ self-service grocery
stores.
	   In June 1950, he opened Britain's first self-service store to a
mixed reaction. Handed a wire basket at the store entrance, one
shopper threw it right back at Sainsbury on being told she was
expected to carry around her own purchases _ normally the job of a
shop assistant.
	   Educated at Haileybury, a private school, Alan Sainsbury joined
the family business in 1921, starting behind the counter.
	   With his younger brother, Robert, he took over running the
company in 1938. Both brothers retired in 1967 to become joint
presidents, and the next generation, including Lord Sainsbury's
three sons, took over. The company was launched on the stock
exchange in 1973.
	   Sainsbury took a keen interest in public affairs. Three times he
tried unsuccessfully to get elected to the House of Commons for the
centrist Liberal Party. In the unelected Lords he was active on
consumer issues, and sat on government advisory committees relating
to food and commerce.
	   He supported charities, including medical research and
furthering of Jewish-Christian understanding.
	   He married twice, first to ballet dancer Doreen Adams, by whom
he had three sons. They were divorced in 1939. He had a daughter by
his second wife, Anne Lewy.
	   Both wives died before him and he is survived by his children.

Reactor stopped at Ukraine's Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was stopped for scheduled repairs
at Ukraine's Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, officials said
Monday.
	   The plant's only operational reactor was shut down Sunday and is
to be restarted by Friday, the state nuclear energy company
Energoatom said.
	   No radiation leaks were reported during the shutdown.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power facilities have 14 reactors, five
of which are currently undergoing repairs, Energoatom said.
	   The country's nuclear officials said last week the number of
malfunctions at nuclear power plants, which was steadily growing in
the first half of 1998, had fallen in the past several months.

Embattled Bangladeshi author won't bow to her critics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS latest protest in graf 4. Has moved to some points.
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima
Nasrin said Monday she will never bow to the Islamic extremists who
have vowed to kill her because of her alleged blasphemy.
	   ``I'll never be silenced. Nor shall I compromise my ideas and
thoughts,'' Nasrin, 36, told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from her hide-out.
	   The author has been in hiding since her return to Bangladesh in
September to care for her mother, who is dying of colon cancer. She
had spent the previous four years in exile in Europe and America
after her critics offered a reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to
anyone who would kill her. She also faces arrest for allegedly
offending the religious sentiments of Muslims in this predominately
Islamic country.
	   Thousands of angry Muslims have poured into the streets in
renewed protest against the author since her return. In the most
recent demonstrations, scores of anti-Nasrin protesters attacked a
government office and smashed windows in Sunamganj, a town 110
miles (176 kilometers) northeast of Dhaka, the capital, on Sunday.
	   ``I've not done anything wrong. I've told the truth and will
continue to do so,'' she said, angrily denying a report that she
was considering apologizing to her critics and seeking their
forgiveness.
	   ``The question of seeking any apology does not arise,'' she
said.
	   Nasrin, a poet, essayist and novelist, became a target of
Islamic extremists after a newspaper quoted her as saying the
Koran, Islamic holy book, should be rewritten.
	   She denied making the comment, but said she favored changes in
Islamic laws to give women in her conservative society more rights.
	   ``I still believe that if any religion keeps women under slavery
I can't accept that religion,'' Nasrin said in her telephone
interview.
	   Her novel, ``Lajja'', or ``Shame'', criticized Muslims for
persecuting minority Hindus in Bangladesh in retaliation for the
destruction of a mosque by Hindu zealots in neighboring India in
1992. The book was banned in Bangladesh.

Asian stock markets close mostly lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets closed mostly lower Monday,
with share prices tumbling in Tokyo on profit-taking.
	   Bucking the trend was the Philippine Stock Exchange, where the
key index surged 4.1 percent on the back of a stronger peso and
expectations of a further softening of domestic interest rates.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 301.24
points, or 2.13 percent, closing at 13,843.46. On Friday, the
average had fallen 150.86 points, or 1.06 percent.
	   Investors took profits following the Nikkei's 10 percent surge
in the five days leading up to Friday.
	   Traders also said foreign investors were selling to make up for
Wall Street's losses Friday, when the benchmark Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 80 points.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.02 yen in late
afternoon, down 0.12 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above its
New York level of 117.95 yen late Friday.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 62.42 points
to 1,586.40 after gaining 29.36 points on Friday.
	   The peso came close to testing the key level of 41.50 pesos per
dollar. For the day, the dollar averaged 41.806 pesos, down from
Friday's 42.245 pesos, on strong dollar inflows to the stock market
and remittances from Filipinos working abroad, dealers said.
	   The market was closed in New Zealand for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed slightly lower as some investors
took profits following recent sharp gains. The Hang Seng Index fell
38.84 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 9,778.91.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index fell 5.14 points, or 0.07 percent, to
7,050.32.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher on expectations of
a cut in interest rates. The All Ordinaries Index rose 19.4 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 2,563.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking following
recent sharp gains. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 7.49
points, or 1.9 percent, to 373.32.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed generally lower, but late buying in
some big capitalization shares caused the index to finish higher.
The Composite Index edged up 1.896 points, or 0.6 percent, to
315.311.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower in listless trading.
The Composite Index slipped 0.61 point to 419.11.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed flat to higher. The Straits Times Index
slipped 0.09 point to 1,113.50.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower in heavy
trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 2.55 points, or
0.7 percent, to 319.02.

Georgia expects more EBRD loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia has negotiated a dlrs 200
million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to help build an oil pipeline, President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Monday.
	   Georgia is building a pipeline that would carry some of the
early oil produced by an international consortium off Azerbaijan's
Caspian Sea shelf to Western Europe.
	   The EBRD loan would help complete the pipeline and build an oil
terminal at Georgia's Black Sea port of Supsa, Shevardnadze said in
a radio interview.
	   Georgia hopes that oil transit fees will help rebuild its
economy, weakened by political unrest and a war in the secessionist
province of Abkhazia.
	   The London-based EBRD, which is supporting development projects
in Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, is also helping to
modernize Georgia's railway and power plants.
	   The EBRD has already earmarked dlrs 85 million in loans to
Georgia so far this year, said Vazha Kapanadze, head of the
government's department for economic reform.
	   Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who returned to
lead his native Georgia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, has
successfully used his connections in the West to obtain financial
aid.

Nigerian leader orders army to support civilian rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar has warned soldiers not to intervene in the West African
country's planned transition to democracy unless called on by
politicians.
	   ``The Nigerian army must remain a stabilizing factor ready to do
our best to ensure continuity,'' Abubakar said in a leaflet of
military guidelines handed out recently to troops. ``Military
action is subordinate to political will.''
	   In the leaflet, which stressed the need to restore
professionalism to Nigeria's military ranks, Abubakar accused
officers of vying amongst themselves for power and prestige.
	   Some officers ``resort to intrigues and disrespect of the
military way of doing things,'' Abubakar said adding that cover-ups
of military failures were common.
	   Since taking power in June following the sudden death of his
predecessor, the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Abubakar has
promised sweeping reforms of the country's political landscape.
	   Civilian elections are planned for Feb. 27 and a handover of
power at the end of May.

Cambodian opposition urges ADB to stop loans to government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's two-party opposition
asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to
the incumbent government, which it calls illegal.
	   Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked,
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from
strongman Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make
its members' return an international issue.
	   Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in
July, but the opposition _ claiming widespread intimidation and
fraud _ has denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament
required to approve the next government. Meanwhile, it says, the
old government is holding power illegally.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying
campaign against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB
President Mitsuo Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to
it.
	   ``We respectfully advise the Asian Development Bank not to
provide any new loans to the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two
party leaders wrote. ``At best the current regime could be
considered a caretaker government as it has not been approved by
the National Assembly.''
	   After a meeting between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to
Cambodia, Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had
repeated calls for the opposition to return, but expressed concern
that the international community may be asked for security
guarantees.
	   ``There have been reports that there is an attempt to
internationalize the return of those members of parliament on the
excuse of security problems,'' Prak Sokhonn said. ``Some
(opposition politicians) have wanted the United Nations to help
guarantee a safe return for them.''
	   The U.N. secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh
provided monitors to opposition politicians after they returned to
Cambodia to participate in the July election. The monitoring ended
Sept. 30.
	   ``Our office has not received any official request for that
operation to be started up again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice
said Monday in reaction to Prak Sokhonn's statement.
	   The opposition has insisted that any further talks on the next
government must take place outside the country, but the ruling
party has rejected allegations of intimidation and recently
guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country.
	   Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear
fruit Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State
Nobutaka Machimura said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia.
	   Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that he could
influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is now
``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of the
three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said.

Pakistan hopes to strike deal with IMF to avoid default
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan expects an economic bail out
package because ``it's not in the interest of lenders to see
Pakistan default on its payments,'' a senior government official
said Monday.
	   Pakistan has restarted stalled negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund, according to Ashan Iqbal, deputy chief
of Pakistan's Planning Commission.
	   ``I am optimistic that the country will get a bailout package
because it's not in the interest of lenders to see Pakistan
defaulting on the loan repayments,'' he said.
	   The package will have to come in the next few weeks if Pakistan
is to avoid a default on repayment of its dlrs 32 billion external
debt.
	   ``We are in negotiations with the international lending agencies
and we hope that an agreement will be reached in the next few
weeks,'' Iqbal said in an interview Monday. ``The government has
arranged for all essential debt servicing in the coming weeks. . .
by that time we will be able to reach an agreement with the IMF.''
	   Pakistan, hurt by international sanctions after conducting
nuclear tests in May and suffering from falling foreign exchange
reserves, is trying to get a bail out package of dlrs 5 billion
from global lenders.
	   Earlier Pakistan warned it will request a moratorium if it
doesn't get the international help it needs.
	   Western economists say Pakistan desperately needs to restructure
its loans and receive emergency funds to keep its ailing economy
afloat.
	   ``Our economy was improving during the last one year until it
was hit by sanctions. . . but it is a temporary crisis which will
be managed,'' Iqbal said.
	   Last week, the IMF deferred loan talks with Pakistan after Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's government slashed electricity tariffs by
30 percent despite a demand by global donors that he increase
utility rates.
	   The government also is in the middle of a feud with private
power companies accusing them of charging inflated rates to the
state utility company, Water and Power Development Authority.
	   Iqbal said Sharif has ordered the dispute settled amicably, but
it wasn't immediately clear how that was to occur. The government
wants the rates charged by the power companies reduced, but so far
they are resisting.
	   Iqbal said Pakistan's beleaguered economy also is the result of
51 years of neglect and distorted policies.
	   ``The government is taking steps, but there are no quick fixes.
. . . it requires sustained efforts to implement the reform
program,'' he added.

Government takes over bank after mafia scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Central Bank has taken over a private
bank after depositors began withdrawing money following allegations
that its owner has ties to a mafia boss.
	   The bank's owner, Korkmaz Yigit, was quoted by the daily
newspaper Milliyet on Monday as saying depositors dlrs 200 million
in the week following the release of a taped conversation between
himself and mafia boss Alaattin Cakici.
	   The government issued a statement Sunday saying the Central Bank
would take over Bank Ekspres and appoint new directors and
auditors. It cited ``recent developments'' as the reason for the
takeover, without elaborating.
	   The scandal also forced Yigit to decide to sell off his recently
acquired TV stations and newspapers. And last week, the government
suspended the privatization of another bank, Turkbank, because of
Yigit's alleged mafia ties.
	   In the taped conversation, Yigit is heard asking Cakici to help
him fend off rival bidders. Yigit, the winning bidder for Turkbank,
has said he did nothing wrong.
	   A government minister has also resigned after a tape linking him
to Cakici was released.

Muslim leader in Chechnya escapes attempt on life

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a car carrying a senior Muslim
cleric in breakaway Chechnya on Thursday, but he was not hurt,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Mufti Akhmad Khadzhi Kadirov was approaching his home in the
Chechen capital of Grozny when the bomb went off under his Mercedes
600, wounding his driver, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   Kadirov and his bodyguard managed to scramble out of the burning
car after the blast, which also destroyed a small building and blew
out windows nearby.
	   The attack came one day after a similar car bomb killed
Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid Bargishev.
	   Anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
promise to launch an all-out offensive against hostage-takers, and
his recent success in securing the release of several captives,
including a British couple and 24 Russian soldiers.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   Chechnya's first deputy security minister, Abu Movsayev, said
that the Russian military may have been behind the killing.
Bargishev had recently challenged a claim by the Russian prosecutor
general's office that it had freed the Russian servicemen from
captivity, Movsayev said.
	   Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry in the southern Russian region
of Dagestan offered Monday to help combat hostage-taking in
neighboring Chechnya after the attack on Bargishev, ITAR-Tass said,
citing the ministry's press center.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also
been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in
Chechnya.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.

Retail sector squeezed as Hong Kong tightens its belt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The arrival of fall fashion hasn't sparked the
usual buying frenzy at Ting May Lung's shoe store this season.
	   In fact, sales are down 30 percent from last year, and Ting has
slashed prices on the new merchandise to try to sell it.
	   It's not the predominance of platform heels that is putting
customers off.
	   ``The economy's bad,'' the 35-year old shop-owner said. ``We've
ordered a little less stock, but not that much less because you
earn as much as you sell.''
	   Ting's plight is similar for retailers across Hong Kong, from
the small, family-run shops, to the retail chains, to the high-end
boutiques.
	   As the territory tightens its belt in a recession, the retail
sector is getting squeezed, if not strangled.
	   Profits have dwindled, and some companies are reporting losses.
The sector has taken a ``double whammy,'' said Arthur Woo, an
economist at HSBC Securities Asia Ltd.
	   Tourism has waned, while local consumers, faced with diminishing
asset values and soaring interest rates on mortgages, are spending
less in this former shopping mecca.
	   Retail sales, which include clothing, electronic goods, watches
and jewelry _ items often on the shopping lists of visitors to the
territory _ declined for the 10th consecutive month in August. For
the first eight months this year, retail sales fell by 15 percent
from the same period in 1997, the government said Monday.
	   Plunging retail sales don't bode well for the economy as a
whole. The retail sector only represents a small percentage of Hong
Kong's gross domestic product, but in some ways it is a key part of
the territory's identity.
	   The streets of Causeway Bay, a popular shopping center, are
littered with vacant shops, while most of those remaining are
plastered with signs advertising sales.
	   The streets are still bustling, just not with big spenders. Even
discounts of up to 90 percent aren't luring some people to pry open
their purses.
	   Just one year after retailers were bursting at the seams with
expansion plans, the plummeting sales have forced retailers to
close shops, cut salaries and lay off workers.
	   That has resulted in a 17 percent unemployment rate in the
retail sector, according to a recent survey by one union, compared
with the 5 percent total unemployment, a 15-year high.
	   Hoping to boost sales, several shops have even resorted to
deception. They hang up ``Last Ten Days'' signs outside, but 10
days pass and the stores remain open.
	   Makeshift stores have set up in recently vacated spaces, paying
half the regular rents for short-term leases and selling discounted
items for as long as they can make a profit.
	   For instance, Yan Jin Zhi has been renting a non-air conditioned
shell of a store with plaster walls and cement floors for several
months.
	   One evening, running his fingers down a notebook of the daily
tally, the 60-year-old bookseller shook his head.
	   At 7 p.m., the day's sales were about 1,000 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 130) shy of the 3,000 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 387)
daily rent for his shell of a store in one of the city's popular
shopping districts, Mong Kok.
	   ``We've cut prices by half, rented out space in front of the
shop to umbrella and cell phone accessory vendors, which looks bad,
but there's no other way,'' Yan said. ``There's just no money to
earn.''
	   Several retailers, unable to make ends meet after closing shops
and laying off staff, asked employees to take pay cuts. That led
the Labor Department to issue public statements reminding stores
about workers' rights in the territory.
	   When 16 employees of casual clothes retailer Apple Shop refused
to sign agreements on salary cuts, they were fired, local
newspapers reported. Management refused to even discuss the case.
	   Meanwhile, at the top of the line, luxury retailer Dickson
Concepts (International) Ltd., whose operations include the Warner
Brothers Studio Stores and Polo/Ralph Lauren outlets in Hong Kong,
fell victim to the recession and cut salaries by 10 percent.
	   Yet for as many retailers cut back or fold, there may be a
silver lining to the downturn, or maybe a silver-plated lining.
	   Discount stores, once an exception in this name-brand conscious
city, are taking advantage of cheaper rents and more cost-conscious
consumers to finally set up shop.
	   ``Ten dollar'' stores, where everything costs just 10 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.30), are doing a brisk business with choosier,
cost-conscious customers.
	   For instance, although it is reluctant to brand itself a
``discount'' store, Watson's Wine Cellar opened a few months ago to
offer wines at prices as low as 39 dollars (U.S. dlrs 5).
	   ``There's still growth, but maybe the growth is not at the top
end,'' said Jeanette Peterson, the store's wine liaison. ``In the
retail sector across the board, people are looking for a price
point, and if they don't find it they don't buy it.''

Electricity company cuts power to stretch of Trans-Siberian

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional electrical company cut power Monday to
a 1,230-kilometer (765-mile) stretch of the Trans-Siberian Railway
because the railway hasn't paid its bill.
	   Seventy-six freight trains were stranded on the Trans-Baikalian
part of the railway, a dispatcher told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Chitaenergo electrical company cut power from the Petrovsky
Zavod Station in the Chita region of eastern Siberia to the Mogocha
station.
	   ITAR-Tass said the energy company is demanding payment of an 8
million ruble (dlrs 470,000) bill. The railway said it has no money
because shipments have dwindled recently and cargo rates for
vegetables were reduced by a government decree.

Serb troop movements as NATO measures compliance with peace deal0

pullbacks &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo's roads Monday as the government tried to convince NATO
it is meeting the deadline for complying with the peace deal to
avoid airstrikes.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors were hearing a briefing
Monday from the alliance's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark, on
his weekend talks in Belgrade, where he pressed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said in Washington that Clark
``made clear the need for significant compliance on the ground by
Tuesday.'' That is NATO's latest deadline for Milosevic to comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis without airstrikes.
	   As the deadline approached, the government's Serb Media Center
said three military units were returning to their barracks Monday
in the towns of Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   Later, a convoy of more than two dozen green Yugoslav tanks,
other armored vehicles and trucks was seen rolling through the
Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the Komorane checkpoint, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina,
but the policemen manning the small house at the intersection
remained on duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic at the intersection.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
who fled the fighting can return to their homes safely.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying the with
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim Serb-led forces
withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return after they
leave to harass civilians.
	   On Sunday, mourners ran away or dived for cover when gunfire
whistled overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence wouldn't protect
the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind the mountain village Krajkova,
30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina.
	   His father, Rashit Elshani, blamed Serb police, saying his son
died simply because he's Albanian. Police have been shooting in the
area every night to try to scare off villagers, he said. Serb
officials were unavailable for comment.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about 1,000 meters (yards) away, the same
area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several times after
the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   On Sunday, President Clinton, while on a fund-raising trip in
California, spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair about the need to keep the pressure on
Milosevic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''

Hong Kong discloses government stock holdings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two months after a highly criticized foray into
the stock and futures markets, Hong Kong's investment company
disclosed Monday that the government spent U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion
in its unprecedented buying spree.
	   The government bought shares in all 33 stocks that make up the
the blue chip Hang Seng Index, officials said after the market had
closed Monday.
	   The government now holds more than 10 percent of issued shares
of three big companies _ the property conglomerates Cheung Kong
Holdings and New World Development, and the aviation-to-insurance
holding company Swire Pacific A.
	   After coming under sharp attack from critics who warned that the
intervention could ruin Hong Kong's status as a free-wheeling
market, Hong Kong officials promised to be more open in the future.
	   Any changes in share holdings of 1 percent or more will be
disclosed, said Ti-Liang Yang, chairman of the Exchange Fund
Investment Ltd., which was set up to manage the government's stock
holdings.
	   In a two-week period in August, the government snapped up the
shares in an effort to drive what it called ``market manipulators''
out of the stock, futures and currency markets.
	   Hong Kong officials contended that big investors were selling
the Hong Kong dollar, which forced monetary authorities to raise
interest rates to preserve the currency's fixed link with the U.S.
dollar.
	   At the same time, the speculators were selling shares on the
Hong Kong stock market, then cashing in when the higher interest
rates helped to push shares lower.
	   The intervention was met with sharp criticism from analysts who
said Hong Kong could be driving away long-term investors by going
against its free market traditions.
	   Politicians also criticized the government for spending its
reserves without consulting the legislature.
	   The government later introduced a series of regulations to
restrict speculative activity and stabilize the markets.
	   Officials had not previously disclosed the holdings because
existing regulations on disclosure do not apply to the government.
They also said any premature disclosure could wreak further havoc
in the markets and that they would disclose the details only after
speculators had left the Hong Kong markets.

Yeltsin at country residence preparing for trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin newspaper interview. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has recovered from a
recent illness, worked at his country residence on Monday in
preparation for a trip to Austria, his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has recovered from the respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this month.
But he has still not returned to work full time in the Kremlin, and
he is limiting his Austrian trip to one day instead of the two
originally planned.
	   Press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working Monday
at his Gorky-9 residence outside of Moscow, getting ready for his
trip to Vienna on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeltsin's agenda in Vienna includes a meeting with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two are expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin was quoted as telling an Austrian newspaper that he was
``absolutely convinced'' that Russia would overcome its problems.
	   ``We will move neither from the reforms which are directed
toward the building of socially oriented market economy, nor from
further democratization of society,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Neue Kronen Zeitung newspaper.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin is also scheduled to meet with International
Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss economic
assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Officials accompanying Yeltsin will sign a number of economic
agreements that should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment
to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has serious
health problems.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

Seaman dies during rescue operation

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ One seaman died early Monday as
Danish and German navy rescuers evacuated the crew of a burning
freighter in the stormy North Sea.
	   The fire aboard the Italian-owned freighter ''Pallas'' broke out
Sunday about 110 kilometers (70 miles) off the west coast of
Denmark. The ship was en route to Morocco with a load of timber,
the Danish navy said.
	   The crew tried to get the fire under control, but requested
evacuation after it appeared the ship was foundering.
	   The navy said all of the 17 crew members except the captain
leaped into the sea to be picked up by helicopters, but one of them
was crushed against the ship's hull.
	   The victim's name and nationality were not immediately released.
The crew included seamen from Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and the
Philippines.
	   The captain, a Pole, remained aboard for several hours, then was
evacuated. The burning ship was left drifting and the Danish navy
said the seas were too high to try towing it.
	   The ship is owned by Bugatti Shipping Services of Italy and
registered in the Bahamas, the navy said.

Wife of jailed dissident says rioters acted in self-defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Chris Patten &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of Malaysia's jailed
dissident leader said Monday violent riots over the weekend were
sparked by growing frustration with police brutality and the
17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   An anti-government protest at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur Saturday
night turned into a violent clash when police lobbed tear gas and
shot chemical-laced water jets into the Muslim house of worship as
demonstrators hurled stones and bricks.
	   It was the first time demonstrators had retaliated against
police, who have banned rallies supporting ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim. Police arrested 268 people for rioting.
Some appeared to be weekend shoppers caught in the middle of the
afternoon demonstration.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, called the rioting ``a violent
tragedy,'' and a ``manifestation of the people's anger toward Dr.
Mahathir, which could not be contained any longer.''
	   She warned that more disruptions could break out.
	   ``They have no other avenue,'' Azizah told reporters, adding she
believed demonstrators acted out of self-defense after being
provoked by riot police.
	   ``Trouble may probably occur if the people have to defend
themselves from the brutal actions of the riot squad.''
	   Peaceful anti-government demonstrations have gained momentum
since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20. Thousands have mobbed the streets of
the capital in what have become weekly Saturday affairs, demanding
the resignation of the 72-year-old Mahathir.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy Sept. 2, saying his former
protege was morally unfit to lead. Anwar goes on trial Nov. 2 on 10
charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, which he says
were trumped up to stem his rising popularity.
	   On Saturday, protesters and police blamed each other for coming
to blows. Police said they spotted protesters with homemade
explosives, and violence started when some threw stones. Protesters
said that police fired first.
	   Azizah, who was appointed by Anwar to lead his reform movement
while he is in custody, denied any role in organizing Saturday's
protests.
	   ``Neither I nor Anwar Ibrahim has ever directed, asked or urged
the people to hold any kind of illegal gathering, what's more, to
instruct the people to act violently while destroying public
property,'' Azizah said. ``This is a total contradiction to what we
stand for.''
	   Anwar's case drew concern from the United States, Australia and
many Southeast Asian neighbors when he appeared in court with a
black eye and bruised right arm. Anwar said the injuries resulted
from a police beating.
	   On Monday, Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last colonial governor,
voiced his support for Anwar, while his wife paid a house call to
Azizah.
	   ``He is a friend of mine and to many around the world,'' Patten
told a group of international editors. ``The whole world will be
watching what happens in his case.''
	   Patten compared Anwar to Myanmar's dissident leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He said the two represented
``the best Asian arguments for universality of values ... that
freedom and democracy aren't merely Western values.''
	   Mahathir, meanwhile, accused Anwar of instigating Saturday's
street protests in hopes of toppling Asia's longest-serving ruler.
	   ``We cannot be brought down by demonstrations in the streets,''
said Mahathir, who spoke after Patten at the same conference.
	   The city's police chief, Kamarrudin Ali, called the Saturday
riot ``the most serious incident to date.''
	   ``We have no choice but to take stern action against them. If
their actions are left unchecked, innocent bystanders might fall
victim,'' the police chief said Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A month after Germany's left swept to power
in elections, the new parliament is setting out toward
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's agenda for change.
	   With the Social Democrats and ecology-minded Greens jointly
running the country for the first time, both parties have pledged
to buttress the social welfare state while promising continuity in
foreign policy.
	   On the eve of the legislature's opening session Monday,
Schroeder promised ``a new beginning for Germany'' after 16 years
of conservative rule by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Schroeder, 54, is to be formally elected chancellor Tuesday by
the new 669-seat chamber, which has a four-year term. He will lead
the nation through historic changes: the government's return to the
prewar capital, Berlin, next year, and the Jan. 1 debut of Europe's
single currency, the euro.
	   On Monday, parliament was expected to elect its first president
from former communist East Germany. Wolfgang Thierse, a 55-year-old
Social Democrat, was active in the democracy movement that brought
down the Berlin Wall in 1989.
	   Kohl, who united Germany in 1990, received a medal Monday from
President Roman Herzog honoring his ``service to Germany and
Europe.'' Only one other chancellor, postwar leader Konrad
Adenauer, has previously received the special order of merit.

Report: Some Singapore banks won't issue credit cards to
</HEADLINE>
expatriates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Local banks in Singapore have mostly stopped
issuing credit cards to expatriates, citing difficulties in
recovering unpaid debts after they leave, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Two of Singapore's four largest local banks now reject all
applications by foreigners outright, said The Straits Times, while
the other two demand credit histories and local guarantors before
issuing cards to many expatriates.
	   These banks fear unpaid credit card bills will aggravate
mounting bad corporate debt from the regional economic crisis, a
banker told the newspaper.
	   They also lack the international network to pursue foreigners
who leave without settling their personal debts.
	   About 450,000 foreigners _ mostly laborers and maids, but also
well-heeled professionals _ work and live among Singapore's 3.1
million permanent population. But high salaries don't seem to
preclude irresponsible use of credit cards.
	   One banker told the newspaper that a high-ranking foreign
executive at a bank in Singapore left the country with 30,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 18,400) in unpaid debt.
	   Expatriates now rely on foreign institutions operating in
Singapore _ including Citibank, Standard Chartered bank and
American Express _ for their credit card needs, the report said.

IMF official: Asia on road to recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most battered Asian economies appear headed
toward recovery, and further aggressive U.S. interest rate cuts may
not be necessary to help lift the region out of its crisis, a
senior International Monetary Fund executive said Monday.
	   Flemming Larsen, the IMF's deputy director of research, said
market confidence seems to be returning to Asia and most economies
could begin to recover early next year.
	   ``Financial markets are finally getting convinced that the
reforms are beginning to work,'' Larsen told a Hong Kong news
conference. ``This news is clearly very positive.''
	   ``The crisis in Asia will begin to bottom out in the next three
to six months and next year we expect the recovery to begin,'' he
said.
	   The IMF is most hopeful about recovery in South Korea and
Thailand, but Indonesia's recent market strength is also
encouraging, Larsen said. Concerns remain about Malaysia, he said.
	   Convinced that Asia is about to bounce back, foreign investors
have been pouring money back into the region's financial markets in
recent weeks.
	   Investors are generally encouraged by the strengthening of the
Japanese yen, seen as crucial to the financial health of the
region, as well as the country's apparent determination to fix its
ailing banking sector.
	   Although the credit crunch that has been choking emerging
markets is unlikely to ease until next year, Larsen said he sees no
immediate need for the United States and major European nations to
cut interest rates again.
	   Even without further easing of its monetary policy, the United
States can retain positive growth, though at a slower, healthier
pace, Larsen said. The IMF forecast 2.0 percent worldwide growth
this year and 2.5 percent in 1999.
	   Larsen said Hong Kong will continue to face a difficult
operating environment into next year. Larsen said the IMF forecasts
a 5.0 percent contraction in the Hong Kong economy this year, but
he added it could even be worse.

Greek Cypriots to build naval base, threatening tension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ In a move certain to anger Turkey and
stoke tension on this Mediterranean island, the Cypriot government
said Monday that construction work has begun on a naval base.
	   Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou did not specify the location
of the base, but the area around the western resort town of Paphos
has been mentioned as a possible site.
	   ``Preliminary infrastructure work'' has started at the site, he
said on state radio. He added that the government was seeking
additional funds to finance the construction, but gave no details.
	   The base appears destined for use by Greek warships since the
Greek Cypriots only have a small force of maritime police based at
commercial ports in the southern towns of Larnaca and Limassol.
	   The facility would be the second on the island built almost
exclusively for use by the Greek armed forces under the provisions
of a 1993 defense pact between Cyprus and Greece.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided since Turkey invaded and
occupied its northern third in 1974 following a coup on the island
by supporters of union with Greece. The island's Greek and Turkish
communities have lived apart since, separated by a U.N.-patrolled
cease-fire line. Tension, in recent months, has risen.
	   The Greek Cypriot government, the only internationally
recognized administration on the island, completed an air base near
Paphos in February for use by Greek warplanes.
	   The air base was first used by Greek jets in March, prompting
angry protests from Turkey. Greek planes again landed there during
six days of war games with Greek Cypriots that ended Sunday.
	   Omirou said two of six Greek fighter-jets that took part would
remain at the Paphos air base after the exercises ended ``to deal
with any eventual Turkish provocation.''
	   Omirou also revealed that Greek jets, for the first time, took
off from the Paphos air base Sunday to intercept and chase away
Turkish aircraft violating the island's air space.
	   Cyprus and Greece claimed Turkish aircraft repeatedly violated
their airspace during the exercises. Ankara denied the charges and
said Saturday the games threatened the region's security.
	   Beside warplanes, Greece sent five navy warships to participate
in the exercises. About 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops took part.

Party No. 2 steps up bid in power struggle with Le Pen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The No. 2 leader of the far-right National Front,
Bruno Megret, has ratcheted up his bid to head the party list in
next year's Europarliamant election, and prevent leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen's wife from running instead.
	   Le Pen has proposed his politically inexperienced wife, Jany, to
replace him if declared ineligible Nov. 17 for roughing up a woman
Socialist candidate in last year's legislative election campaign.
	   But the decision, part of a trend of Front leaders having their
wives run for them, has caused a split in the party. Megret, who
just released the book ``The New Europe,'' said in an interview
published Monday that it would be a mistake.
	   If Le Pen is barred from politics for two years, ``I would not
consider the candidacy of his wife to be a good idea, and in that
scenario I am a candidate for the candidacy,'' he told Le Parisien.
	   ``Having said that, I will follow the decision that is made,''
he added.
	   Megret acknowledged he was under fire from some Front leaders
but said he remained confident ``because I feel strong and
well-supported by the movement.''
	   Megret insisted his relations with Le Pen ``are normal,'' and
asked if he feared a party split, he said: ``Of course not!''
	   In announcing his wife's eventual candidacy last month, Le Pen
reminded his supporters of the Front's opposition to the new
European single currency, and he again demanded an end to
immigration to France, which he said led to higher unemployment.
	   The party has garnered about 15 percent in recent elections,
though it scored as high as a third of the vote in some regional
races earlier this year.
	   It wouldn't be the first time the wife of a National Front
politician has stood for election to get around a ban.
	   Catherine Megret was elected mayor of the southern town of
Vitrolles after her husband was declared ineligible there due to
vote fraud.
	   Cendrine Le Chevallier won a legislative by-election in Toulon
earlier this year after her husband, Jean-Marie, was found guilty
of breaking financing rules. She was later defeated in a new vote
held last month.

Armenian jazz festival raises money for devastating 1988 quake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Jazz musicians from around the world
held an impromptu morning jam session Monday at a small cafe to
wrap up a five-day jazz festival celebrating the 60th anniversary
of jazz in Armenia.
	   More than 50 jazz musicians from Armenia, the United States,
Russia, and Israel gathered for the festival in the former Soviet
republic. Proceeds went to repair damage from a 1988 earthquake
that ravaged northwestern Armenia.
	   The performers, including the popular New York-based vocal
quartet New York Voices, pianist Armen Donelian and popular Russian
musician Georgy Garanyan, were mostly of Armenian origin.
	   They played music based on ``ancient Armenian melodies,
spiritual and folk music,'' according to musician Datevik
Hovanesian, and also covered classics by Charlie Parker, Louis
Armstrong, and Percy Smith.
	   On Sunday some of the musicians gave a performance in Duymri,
one of the towns ruined by the Dec. 7, 1998 quake.
	   The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.9, killed 25,000
people and destroyed more than 345 villages and towns. The country
still has not fully recovered from the damage.

Romanian president leaves for Norway, Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
is in Norway hoping to get support for his country's bid to join
NATO, on the first leg of a Nordic tour, national radio reported
Monday.
	   ``We shall try to show Norway that Romania is a reliable
country,'' said Constantinescu before taking off Sunday evening. he
also hopes to persuade Norwegian businesses to invest in Romania's
ailing economy which is struggling to transform to a market
economy.
	   Norway opposed Romania's membership during the Madrid summit
where Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, also former
communist countries, were invited to join.
	   Constantinescu argued that Romania which is in southeast Europe,
can reinforce the eastern flank of the military alliance.
	   During his one-day visit to Oslo, Constantinescu will meet
Norway's King Harald V and Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
	   Romania's Industry and Trade Minister Radu Berceanu and
Communications Ministry Sorin Pantis were accompanying

Jose Cardoso Pires, award-winning Portuguese author, dies at 73

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Cardoso Pires, a best-selling
Portuguese author and winner of the country's prestigious Pessoa
Prize last year, died Monday in a Lisbon hospital following a
stroke, his agent said. He was 73.
	   Cardoso Pires had been in a coma since suffering a stroke July
8, his agent Nelson Matos said. The exact cause of death was not
immediately known.
	   Fame came to Cardoso Pires with his 1982 novel; ``Balada da
Praia dos Caes'' (Ballad of Dogs' Beach). He had already been
writing novels, essays and plays for over three decades.
	   In 1991, Cardoso Pires won the Latin Union Prize for Literature
and over the years racked up numerous minor domestic awards.
	   His works have been translated into 15 languages, although some
of his later publications remain only available in Portuguese such
as ``De Profundis - Valsa Lenta'' (De Profundis - Slow Waltz) that
was inspired by an earlier stroke in Jan. 1995 and published last
year.
	   Born in Castelo Branco, 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of
Lisbon, Cardoso Pires spent most of his life in the capital. In
1997 he published ``Livro de Bordo,'' (Lisbon Log Book) a deeply
personal view of the city that has also not been translated.
	   He was survived by his wife and two daughters.
	   The funeral was to take place later Monday in Lisbon.

Air force remains on alert ahead of NATO deadline Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day before a NATO deadline for
Kosovo compliance expires, Yugoslav air force and anti-aircraft
defense remained on full alert, the independent Glas Javnosti
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Quoting an anonymous high-ranking military source, the daily
said it was ``logical'' to expect the state of high alert to remain
in force at least until Tuesday.
	   NATO has warned it would reimpose the threat of airstrikes on
Serbian military targets if Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic
fails to abide by his pledges from a U.S.-brokered Oct. 12
agreement on strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   In capital Belgrade, a top NATO delegation met Milosevic Sunday
to demand more pullbacks of army and police units from the
separatist province, where scattered skirmishes continue.
	   Milosevic had also agreed to a NATO air-surveillance mission
over Kosovo, entitled Eagle Eye, whose flights began Oct. 17, and a
2,000-strong unarmed monitors mission on the ground to observe the
withdrawal.
	   ``Nothing has changed as far as our attitude is concerned... we
shall defend ourselves if attacked,'' the anonymous army source
told Glas Javnosti.
	   The source added it was widely expected that NATO would push
back its deadline for a second time and that some form of airstrike
threat would remain beyond Tuesday.
	   According to the Oct. 12 agreement Yugoslav army radar and air
defense systems are to be dismantled on the territory of the
province as well as within a 25-kilometer (7.5 miles) zone beyond
the province.
	   ``From a safe distance, our radars will keep checking if the
Alliance honors the agreement, too'' the army source said, adding
the army's air-tracking systems in capital Belgrade can register
and trail NATO aircraft the moment they enter Yugoslav air space.
	   ``We shall not sit with our hands crossed,'' the source was
quoted as saying.

Indonesian preachers urge government to push ahead with atrocity
</HEADLINE>
probe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Islamic preachers in a northern
province have urged the government to thoroughly investigate
alleged military atrocities and prosecute suspects, a report said
Monday.
	   An eight-year military operation against a separatist rebel
group in Aceh province left hundreds of people dead and many
villagers harbor deep resentment toward the military.
	   The official Antara news agency said preachers from the
influential Dayah Inshafuddin Association urged the military to
prosecute any soldiers suspected of rape, murder or torture.
	   They appealed to the local government to invite President B.J.
Habibie and armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto to see evidence of
alleged military wrongdoing for themselves.
	   Investigators have dug up mass graves of people reputedly killed
by the military, and some women have alleged they were raped by
soldiers.
	   In a conciliatory move, the government has withdrawn some troops
from Aceh and is trying to undo the bitter legacy of the military
campaign that former President Suharto launched. The authoritarian
leader resigned in May amid riots and protests.
	   Antara quoted the preachers' association as saying community
leaders would invite United Nations human rights workers to
investigate Aceh atrocities if the national government's probe
stalled.
	   ``If this effort does not yield satisfactory results, we will
ask the provincial government along with non-governmental
organizations to invite the U.N. Human Rights Commission to
thoroughly resolve this matter,'' the statement said.
	   A fact-finding team led by the military found that a total of
760 soldiers, rebels and civilians were killed during the operation
against the rebels of the Free Aceh Movement.
	   Aceh is 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta on
the northern tip of Sumatra Island.

Title but no crown for new Miss Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo ZAG-101, 102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ She has the title, but not the crown.
	   Two weeks after a Muslim was proclaimed Miss Croatia, the jury
reversed itself and crowned runnerup, Ivana Petkovic.
	   In a somber atmosphere, broadcast live on national television
late Sunday, 12 members of the jury chose Petkovic, while five
voted for Lejla Sehovic, 22.
	   The new winner said she was ``as excited as during the first
voting'' and that she entered the new round of voting ``with
pure...motives.''
	   Sehovic left in tears, after she was not allowed to give a
statement.
	   ``I wanted to say that this was a set-up, that the new voting is
a farce,'' the newspaper Vecernji List quoted her as saying.
	   This year's beauty contest, popular among Croats, turned into a
national scandal, when organizers stripped Sehovic of her title,
citing voting irregularities.
	   But in the country where many people do not consider Muslims
``real'' Croats, the contest became a political issue, with
Croatian media and some human rights groups saying Sehovic was
ousted just because she's a Muslim.
	   Croatia, which has a small Muslim minority, supported Croats in
neighboring Bosnia during their 1993-4 conflict with Muslims there
and relations between the two remain tense. About 80 percent of
Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman Catholics.
	   After the first contest, media reported that organizers were
unhappy with a Muslim representing Croatia at the Miss World
contest.
	   But chief organizer, Milan Seckovic, denied politics played a
role in the reversal. He insisted that the first voting was
irregular and turned to the Miss World organizer, Eric Morley, for
advice. Morley recommended new voting.
	   Four members of the jury, who earlier openly supported Sehovic,
refused to appear at Sunday's voting.
	   Without music, fireworks or an audience, Petkovic received the
traditional lace and flowers. She also left without the crown,
because it is still with Sehovic, who threatens to sue the
organizers.

Sudan promises to pursue thousands of draft dodgers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Suffering an apparent shortage of men to
fight southern rebels, the Sudanese government began a campaign
Monday to arrest thousands of men evading conscription.
	   The campaign is the latest by the country's Islamic government
to force men to take part in what it calls national service to
fight in the increasingly unpopular 15-year civil war.
	   ``Employees who resigned their jobs (to evade conscription) or
refused to receive notice to join the army will be arrested while
they are at home,'' said Kamal Hassan Ali, spokesman of the
National Service Coordination Committee.
	   Evaders will face three years imprisonment, Ali was quoted as
saying by the independent daily Alwan.
	   All Sudanese men are required to undergo military training, and
President Omar el-Bashir announced in April that the government
planned to recruit 655,000 students for the army.
	   Southern rebels, mainly Christians and adherents of tribal
faiths, have fought the government since 1983 in hopes of winning
more autonomy for the long-neglected south. Some 1.5 million people
have been killed in the fighting and famines caused by it.
	   The conscription system provoked a national outcry after at
least 52 students were killed on April 2 while trying to escape a
military training camp before being sent to the front.

Indonesian president meets oil association delegates

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Monday met a
delegation from the International Petroleum Association to discuss
productivity and competitiveness.
	   IPA officials said tax reductions will attract foreign
investment in one of Indonesia's major export industries.
	   But Habibie did not offer any tax reductions to foreign oil
companies during the meeting, said Sugianto, president of
Pertamina, the state-run oil company.
	   ``Indonesia must do anything possible to reduce the cost of
production, cut bureaucracy and encourage efficiency to enable the
country to compete with other oil-producing countries,'' Mines and
Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said.
	   Pertamina will sponsor a three-day oil conference beginning
Tuesday in Jakarta. Some 2,000 people, including more than 600
foreign delegates, are expected to attend.

Bhutto seeks global body to unite Islamic and Western leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Warning of a ``growing
confrontation'' between Islamic and Western societies, Pakistan's
former prime minister Benazir Bhutto called Monday for the
establishment of a global body to bridge the gap.
	   Ms. Bhutto sent letters calling for this new world body to 40
heads of state, including U.S. president Bill Clinton, the
presidents and leaders of most African and Middle Eastern
countries, as well as European and Asian leaders.
	   In her letter to the world leaders dated Oct. 21 but released on
Monday, Ms. Bhutto warned of future trouble in relations between
western and Islamic governments.
	   She cited the U.S. missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan last
August as ``harbingers of a new and dangerous era in relations
between the West and Islamic societies.''
	   The missiles targeted suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan
and a factory allegedly producing chemical weapons ingredients in
Sudan -- both operations of Saudi Arabian dissident Osama bin
Laden. Sudan says the factory produced only medicines.
	   Washington accuses bin Laden of masterminding the attacks on
U.S. Embassies in East Africa in August.
	   Ms. Bhutto was the first woman to lead a modern Islamic state
when she was first elected prime minister of Pakistan in 1988 in
the first free and fair elections in a country emerging from 11
years of military rule.
	   But Ms. Bhutto was dismissed from power barely 20 months later,
her government disgraced and accused of rampant corruption.
	   However within three years she was back in power. Again her term
was cut short when in 1996 her government was abruptly dismissed on
fresh charges of corruption and economic mismanagement.
	   Ms. Bhutto's call for a summit of leaders from the West and
Islamic nations comes as Pakistan's best organized religious party,
Jamaat-e-Islami, concluded a three day convention Sunday in the
Pakistani capital.
	   At the conference, which organizers say attracted more than
100,000 people, Jamaat-e-Islami leader Qasi Hussain Ahmed urged his
followers to shun western culture, boycott western products and
overthrow Pakistan's rulers in an Islamic revolution that would
impose a new Islamic order in the country.
	   In her letter to the 40 heads of state Ms. Bhutto warned that
``current efforts to build democratic, moderate Islamic societies
will be set back if nothing is done to counter negative actions and
impressions.''
	   Ms. Bhutto also has strongly criticized Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's attempts to pass sweeping Islamic laws that would
give the federal government the authority to ``prescribe what is
right and forbid what is wrong'' in line with its interpretation of
Islam.
	   Government spokesmen, quoted by the state-run Associated Press
of Pakistan, have warned Ms. Bhutto to seek God's forgiveness for
opposing the Islamic law.
	   In her letter Ms. Bhutto says ``in Pakistan we are confronted
with a regime intent on installing a dangerous brand of
dictatorship, cloaked in religious garb . . other Muslim nations
are also feeling the pull of a growing militancy of extremist
groups.''

United States optimistic gap With EU on data privacy can be

bridged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United States is optimistic it can
settle its differences with the European Union over how to protect
private data about citizens, a U.S. diplomat said Monday.
	   On Sunday, an EU law came into effect to protect data privacy.
The law has already been written into the statute books of Greece
and Portugal, and is also being implemented in Britain, Sweden and
Italy along with additional rules.
	   The diplomat, who requested anonymity, said that the U.S.
approach to data protection is much more hands off, with industry
bodies providing ground rules for the buying and selling of
personal data.
	   ``The U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' he said,
adding that the difference could turn into a trade dispute if the
15-nation EU started blocking data flows.
	   In that case, he said, Washington would file a complaint at the
World Trade Organization.
	   However, talks will continue on the issue. ``We expect to
continue our dialogue with the EU and we are optimistic we will
reach a mutually acceptable solution,'' the diplomat said.
	   Personal data including addresses, ages, buying habits, and
income brackets are bought and sold by list brokers in the EU as
well as in the United States. Brokers sell lists on to companies
that are looking for specific demographic groups at whom to market
their products.

Taliban ask games organizers to amend laws for bearded sportsmen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Version also moved on news circuits

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The orthodox Taliban army, which
publicly beats men who trim their beards, asked organizers of the
Olympics and Asian Games to revise its laws to allow boxers to wear
beards.
	   Accusing sports organizers of discrimination, the Taliban's
sports minister said its bearded athletes have been barred from
competing in international competitions, including in neighboring
Pakistan.
	   ``The bearded sportsmen should be allowed to take part in all
sports events. . . the organizations should explain to us why there
are restrictions on them,'' the Taliban's Minister of Sports, Mulla
Abdul Shakoor Muttmayan, told reporters in the Afghan capital.
	   The Taliban militia, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan,
including the capital Kabul, follow a strict version of Islam that
forces men to wear long beards, bars women from work and education
and bans most forms of light entertainment.
	   Men are publicly beaten if their beards are trimmed. A beard is
in keeping with the Taliban's demands that Afghan men emulate
Islam's prophet Mohammed, who was unshaven.
	   Men also are required to wear a head covering, such as a turban,
although it wasn't immediately clear if the Taliban exempted its
athletes from this requirement.
	   Muttmayan complained bitterly that three of his boxers were
barred from competition in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi
this month because of their beards.
	   Although Pakistan also is a mostly Muslim country, it does not
adhere to the same strict interpretation espoused by Afghanistan's
Taliban army, which also does not allow women to participate in
sports.
	   Muttmayan said his boxers were unfairly treated.
	   ``The international sports bodies should respect the laws of the
Islamic government of Afghanistan,'' he said.
	   Muttmayan said the Taliban will be sending 40 athletes to
participate in the Asian Games in Thailand in December.
	   ``We have been invited to these games and will send our
sportsmen to participate in the events including wrestling, boxing
and body building,'' he said.
	   Muttmayan said the Afghan competitors will wear trousers in all
sports events because it is against the Taliban's version of Islam
to display legs.
	   When asked whether there were any swimmers going to the games
and whether they also would be bound by the dress code, Muttmayan
said:
	   ``We have to think about the issue, when we will be having
swimmers. . . it is a bit complicated issue.''

Singapore and China establish direct Internet link
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore and China have established a direct
Internet link to open the way for greater data exchange and
encourage more business collaboration between the two countries.
	   The two megabytes per second link ``will further enhance
existing Internet data exchange, and encourage the sharing of
Internet content, facilitate business and even research and
development collaboration between the two countries,'' the
Telecommunications Authority of Singapore said Monday.
	   Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan and Chinese
Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan will also sign a
memorandum of understanding Wednesday in Beijing outlining areas of
Internet cooperation, the statement added.
	   The agreement will map ways of developing, promoting and
increasing Chinese-language content on the Internet, and boost
electronic commerce between the two countries.
	   Singapore has three Internet service providers, and has recently
opened the market to an unlimited number of public access
providers.
	   The high-tech island republic has worked hard to bring the
Internet into as many homes as possible, and has established
high-speed Internet links with various countries in Asia and the
West to streamline access to foreign sites.
	   China has one of the fastest growing Internet communities in
Asia, and will have more Internet users than any other country in
the region _ excluding Japan _ by 2001, according to
market-research company International Data Corp. Asia-Pacific.
	   IDC said the Internet user population in China will reach about
9.4 million by 2002, up from 1.4 million in 1997.

Serb troop movements as NATO measures compliance with peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with details of Serb troop
pullbacks &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo's roads Monday as the government tried to convince NATO
it is meeting the deadline for complying with the peace deal to
avoid airstrikes.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors were hearing a briefing
Monday from the alliance's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark, on
his weekend talks in Belgrade, where he pressed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said in Washington that Clark
``made clear the need for significant compliance on the ground by
Tuesday.'' That is NATO's latest deadline for Milosevic to comply
with the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis without airstrikes.
	   As the deadline approached, the government's Serb Media Center
said three military units were returning to their barracks Monday
in the towns of Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   Later, a convoy of more than two dozen green Yugoslav tanks,
other armored vehicles and trucks was seen rolling through the
Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the Komorane checkpoint, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina,
but the policemen manning the small house at the intersection
remained on duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic at the intersection.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
who fled the fighting can return to their homes safely.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying the with
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim Serb-led forces
withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return after they
leave to harass civilians.
	   On Sunday, mourners ran away or dived for cover when gunfire
whistled overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence wouldn't protect
the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind the mountain village Krajkova,
30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina.
	   His father, Rashit Elshani, blamed Serb police, saying his son
died simply because he's Albanian. Police have been shooting in the
area every night to try to scare off villagers, he said. Serb
officials were unavailable for comment.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about 1,000 meters (yards) away, the same
area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several times after
the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   On Sunday, President Clinton, while on a fund-raising trip in
California, spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair about the need to keep the pressure on
Milosevic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''

UN: Rwandan genocide convict free to hire own attorney
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A Rwandan genocide convict on a hunger
strike to protest the U.N.'s refusal to hire the lawyer he wants is
free to hire any attorney at his own expense, a court official said
Monday.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former mayor, quit eating Thursday because
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda refused to pay for a
Canadian attorney Akayesu wants.
	   The tribunal has said John Philpot lacks the necessary
credentials.
	   Akayesu was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison for
his role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government. He has appealed.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when Tutsi-dominated rebels defeated government forces.
	   The tribunal ``will not be intimidated or blackmailed by
Akayesu,'' spokesman Kingsley Moghalu said.
	   Moghalu said the tribunal offered Akayesu a choice of six
lawyers, but he failed to respond by a court-set deadline on
Friday.
	   Asked whether Akayesu could hire his own attorney, Moghalu said:
``We have no objection to that.''
	   Moghalu said the tribunal was operating ``within the framework
of U.N. system and its established courts'' in insisting Akayesu
pay for his own lawyer or accept one appointed to him by the
tribunal.
	   Akayesu doing well despite his hunger strike, Moghalu said.
	   Court sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Akayesu
was not eating solid foods, but was smoking heavily at a U.N. jail
in the northern Tanzania town of Arusha, where the tribunal is
based.
	   Akayesu has fired attorneys three times.
	   Speaking in his own defense at his sentencing, Akayesu said he
had been unable to stop the genocide, and begged for forgiveness
from Rwanda's people.

Skiing trip costs Bayern veteran a fine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Lothar Matthaeus has joined a growing
list of Bayern Munich stars being fined for off-field activities.
	   Matthaeus, the 37-year-old sweeper of the runaway Bundesliga
leader, has been fined 10,000 marks (dlrs 6,000) for taking an
unauthorized skiing trip while officially on the injured list, the
Kicker magazine reported Monday.
	   Matthaeus, who has a record 129 appearances for Germany, was
photographed on skis last week in Soelden, Austria, while making an
advertising movie.
	   ``I can't tolerate this,'' said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   Matthaeus has not played for Bayern for three weeks because of a
muscle strain.
	   Mario Basler and Stefan Effenberg, Bayern's two mercurial
midfielders, also have been fined a similar amount in recent weeks,
Basler for staying up late in a disco while also officially injured
and Effenberg for driving drunk.
	   Bayern Munich is dominating the Bundesliga this season with
eight wins and one draw in nine games.

Police disperse jobless college grads outside Parliament

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Riot police charged hundreds of unemployed
college graduates who protested outside Parliament on Monday, and
at least six people were injured.
	   About 300 protesters demanding jobs were outside Parliament when
police charged into the crowd to disperse it, arresting at least 12
people. Police roughed up several foreign and domestic journalists
and seized their film.
	   The demonstrators went on to the regional government prefecture,
then to the local Moroccan Labor Union headquarters, where police
chased them out. Hundreds of police were deployed in central Rabat
to prevent further unrest.
	   Moroccan students and graduates have periodically staged
protests demanding more aid for training and job placement.

Horrors leave their scars on Kosovo's victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After months of running from
Kosovo's violence and worrying about her family, Lumnije's mind
snapped when she was told _ wrongly _ that her guerrilla husband
had been killed.
	   She lies sedated in a hospital bed far from the shooting, the
running, the terror. But her eyes are blank, and her mind needs
mending.
	   ``I want my children,'' Lumnije moans. ``I want my husband.''
	   Her case shows what anguish can do to the minds of refugees
traumatized by the Yugoslav government crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo province.
	   Of the hundreds of thousands who fled the offensive, thousands
are believed mentally scarred by their experiences.
	   Lumnije's two children are safe with relatives, and her
guerrilla-fighter husband is believed alive. But the damage is
done, even though the 34-year-old woman from the war-torn Drenovac
region is improving, say psychiatrists, who won't give her full
name.
	   She screamed abuse and was out of control when relatives brought
her in two weeks ago. Before that, her kin kept her penned up so
she couldn't harm herself or others.
	   No one knows for sure how many others like Lumnije are out in
the mountains, the valleys, the destroyed villages sheltering many
Kosovo refugees.
	   Humanitarian agencies are trying to keep them fed, warm and
physically healthy. But tight budgets mean they don't have
psychologists and other mental health workers out in the field
helping refugees cope with the anguish of losing relatives and
homes, of running for months, of realizing that former Serb
neighbors are now enemies.
	   ``We expect to have lots of work after the war,'' said Dr.
Nijazi Macula, a psychiatrist in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Preliminary estimates by the World Health Organization, based on
similar conflicts elsewhere, suggest more than 15,000 people need
counseling of the 300,000 who have fled.
	   ``We should start to work as soon as possible ... to fight
panic, terror and its aftereffects,'' said Maria Petevi, a WHO
specialist in war-related trauma among refugees.
	   Petevi said the time for help is now, in a period of relative
calm.
	   ``During the crisis period, the major goal is to survive,'' she
said. ``Once that pressure is over ... they start reviewing the
catastrophe. That's when the psychological problems appear.''
	   But help is available only to the few dozen who manage to make
their way to Pristina Hospital.
	   Many fear they might be arrested trying to cross police
checkpoints en route to Pristina. And most folk in backward
villages are ashamed to admit there is something wrong.
	   ``A huge number don't want to come ... they don't want to be
considered crazy,'' said Macula.
	   An additional problem is lack of identity documents. The
Serb-run hospital refuses to treat people without such papers,
which many lost or left behind in their rush for safety.
	   The few who do come carry heavy emotional baggage.
	   Psychiatrist Ava Kurtesi _ like Macula, an ethnic Albanian _
told of a 9-year-old girl and her 6-year-old brother who witnessed
days of fierce fighting in the Drenica region southwest of Pristina
before being brought to the capital by their mother three months
ago. They are jumpy, aggressive and speak of being attacked, she
said.
	   Kurtesi recited a poem the girl recently composed:
	   ``I am only a small girl
	   ``But my heart is tall
	   ``Strong as a lion
	   ``Strong enough to kill them all.''
	   Macula talked about a 16-year-old girl who witnessed her ethnic
Serb neighbors applauding while other Serbs burned the homes of
Albanians.
	   ``Worse then the flames were the townspeople she knew
clapping,'' said Macula. ``Now, she's built a wall around herself.
She's apathetic, unresponsive.''
	   Milenko Karan, an ethnic Serb psychologist, said Pristina's
Serbs are coping well, considering the pressures of being a
dwindling minority in Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   ``So far, there has been a remarkably low level of serious
mental disorders,'' he said.
	   Macula said Albanians in Pristina also are generally doing well,
since the city has been spared violence, but the crisis is gnawing
at them.
	   ``Discussions that used to be normal turn into fights,
depression. Unhappiness is eating away at people,'' he said. ``I'm
seeing about 20 people a day now, compared to five or six a year
ago.''

Romania to send observers and non-combat plane to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania will send observers and an
AN-30 non-combat airplane to the international mission to monitor
the Kosovo peace agreement, newspapers reported Monday.
	   Romania, which is a traditional ally of Serbia also wants to
join NATO. The decision reached Sunday by the Supreme Defense
Council was seen as a way to show its willingness to contribute to
stability in the Balkans.
	   The decision needs the vote of parliament for it to be enacted,
daily Cotidianul reported.
	   Two weeks ago, parliament approved the use of Romania's airspace
in emergency situations if airstrikes were launched against
Yugoslavia to punish President Slobodan Milosevic for provoking
unrest in the strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   President Emil Constantinescu, the prime minister, the foreign
and defense ministers, intelligence and army chiefs form the
Supreme Defense Council.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Salesman Carlos Castillo still shudders at the
rebel car bomb that sprayed glass from his apartment's windows over

	   He hasn't forgotten the hyperinflation that ate away his salary
by the minute, and he remembers living in fear as Peru teetered on

	   His savior arrived through the ballot box in 1990 with the
election of Alberto Fujimori as president.
	   Wielding the iron hand that won him the nickname ``The
Emperor,'' Fujimori shut down Peru's hostile Congress and corrupt
judicial system, imposed drastic economic restructuring and gave
the military free rein to crush leftist rebels. Peruvians
re-elected him in a landslide in 1995.
	   ``He made Peru livable again. Maybe a full democracy works in
the United States, but not here, not yet. We need someone strong or
else there is chaos,'' said Castillo, 37, who lives near Lima's
Tarata Street, where a car bomb killed 21 people and wounded 168 in
1992.
	   As democracy lays down roots from Mexico to Argentina, Latin
Americans sick of rampant corruption and crime are voting for
authoritarian figures, even former dictators, in hopes of restoring
order.
	   In Venezuela, a former paratrooper who tried to overthrow an
elected government in 1992 has a strong lead heading into the Dec.
6 presidential election. Retired Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez has broad
support among poor Venezuelans sick of corrupt and ineffective
politicians.
	   ``Go ahead, call me a coup leader,'' Chavez bellowed at a recent
campaign rally. ``Raise your hands if you think the coup was
justified.''
	   A sea of hands went up.
	   Chavez, who has been denied a visa to the United States because
of his role in the coup, has vowed to fight corruption and govern
for the poor majority. Business leaders fear investors will flee
the country if he wins, and his critics call him a
dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``We must be careful with this authoritarian tendency in
Venezuelan society, which comes from those who call for order,
economic well-being and safety,'' said former President Ramon J.
Velasquez.
	   Last year, Bolivians voted back to power a former dictator who
promised ``a war against poverty, corruption and injustice.'' Gen.
Hugo Banzer, who led a military regime accused of human rights
abuses in 1971-78, won the vote narrowly and formed a coalition
government.
	   Despite the abuses, many Bolivians remember Banzer's government
as a period of relative political and economic stability.
	   In Paraguay, a former armed forces commander who in 1996
rebelled against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy held a wide lead in
opinion polls before last May's presidential election, but the
Supreme Court blocked his candidacy. The court ruled that Gen. Lino
Oviedo had to serve a 10-year prison term for the rebellion.
	   Some Latin Americans recall past dictatorships as providing
higher living standards and streets that were safe to walk at
night.
	   ``There is a nostalgia for the security of authoritarianism in
some sectors, especially in countries where democratic institutions
are new or shaky,'' said retired Gen. Jaime Salinas, director of
the Lima-based Latin American Institute of Civil/Military Studies.
	   A 1998 U.S. government study of global political attitudes found
widespread support for the idea of democracy in Latin America.
	   But it also found that most Latin Americans were unhappy with
their own countries' democracies. More than seven in 10 had little
or no confidence in their political parties, legislatures or police
forces.
	   The study also found a widespread belief that crime and
corruption have increased significantly in the past five years
under democratic governments.
	   ``The large majority of Latin Americans want democracy. But if
they perceive it as threatening their security or economic
well-being, many will look to the barracks,'' Salinas said.
	   Elected leaders in Latin America often use sweeping executive
powers to bypass hostile congresses and courts, arguing they impede
efforts to develop the country.
	   In Argentina, which emerged from a seven-year military
dictatorship in 1983, critics accuse President Carlos Menem of
trampling democratic procedures by using emergency decrees to
bypass congressional opposition. When Congress blocked his plan to
sell 33 state-owned airports, for example, Menem privatized them by
decree.
	   In Peru, Fujimori reportedly governs in an alliance with the
armed forces and the feared National Intelligence Service,
overriding democratic institutions that get in his way.
	   The Fujimori-controlled Congress disbanded Peru's top
constitutional court after it ruled he could not run for a third
term in 2000.
	   ``He rules like the European kings of the 16th century. He
controls everything and accepts little dissent,'' said Luis
Jochamowitz, author of the biography ``Citizen Fujimori.'' ``A lot
of the region's leaders look at him with envy.''

Malaysia's Petronas starts crude oil production in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national petroleum
corporation, Petronas, said Monday it has started producing crude
oil from Vietnam's offshore Ruby Field.
	   The production, averaging 8,000 barrels a day, began last
Thursday, 10 days ahead of schedule, the company said in a
statement.
	   It said commercial production from the field represents a
significant milestone for Petronas as it is the first overseas
exploration and production project the company undertook as an
operator.
	   Petronas operates the Ruby Field under a production-sharing
contract signed Sept. 9, 1991, with PetroVietnam, Vietnam's state
oil company.
	   Petronas holds an 85 percent share in both blocks. The remaining
15 percent is owned by PetroVietnam Exploration and Production Co.,
a subsidiary of PetroVietnam.
	   It said the production comes from two wells drilled and
completed from a single conductor, a drilling technology developed
by Petronas and applied for the first time in Vietnam.
	   Petronas said production from the Ruby Field is planned at
20,000 barrels a day next year.

Parliament hardliners begin process of holding early elections

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with date for parliament debate on agreement, quote

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced his
first political test Monday following his land-for-security deal
with the Palestinians, with parliament likely to defeat a motion of
no confidence in the government.
	   However, another _ perhaps more serious _ threat to Netanyahu's
rule appeared on the horizon, with parliament's Law Committee
convening to discuss an early elections bill.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat, who staunchly opposes the new
peace agreement, said he expected to get a majority in the panel
for approving the bill for a first reading in parliament. Three
readings are required for the bill to become law.
	   ``I believe that the process we are beginning will conclude with
the dispersal of parliament and early elections ... around February
or March,'' Porat told Israel radio.
	   Monday's motion of no confidence was submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet. Netanyahu was expected to survive the
vote, since the dovish opposition said it would not vote with
Moledet.
	   Parliament Speaker Dan Tichon scheduled a two-day debate on the
peace accord, starting Nov. 3. Parliament was expected to approve
the deal overwhelmingly.
	   The opposition, meanwhile, was walking a political tightrope of
trying to topple Netanyahu without endangering Israel's withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank. The pullback is to take 12 weeks,
in exchange for Palestinian security gestures.
	   The coalition chairman, Meir Shetreet, on Monday accused the
opposition of putting partisan interests before the peace process
by supporting the early elections bill in the Law Committee.
	   ``Any date that you set today means that the election campaign
is starting ... and this means endangering our ability to carry out
the peace agreements,'' Shetreet told Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu was to present the accord to his Cabinet on Monday,
but the radio said he postponed the session first until Wednesday,
then until Thursday, apparently concerned he didn't have the
necessary support yet among his ministers.
	   Netanyahu met Monday morning with ministers from his Likud Party
to try and win their backing for the agreement which has broad
public support.
	   In an interview with Israel army radio, Netanyahu dismissed
charges by hardliners that he had caved in on several issues,
including Israel's initial demand that 31 Palestinians be
extradited to Israel.
	   Netanyahu said he had won assurances from the United States that
Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis would serve long terms
in Palestinian jails. ``We know that all ... will do time for
dozens of years,'' he said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel retained the right to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Army radio reported that the government would soon begin
construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, apparently to blunt hardline
opposition to a withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu did not deny the report, saying only that he had not
decided when to start building. ``We have said that building will
take place in Har Homa by 2000, and this will happen,'' he said.
	   With an eye on his right-wing critics, Netanyahu issued a stern
warning to Arafat that no land would be handed over without keeping
their promises.
	   On Monday, a general strike was observed in the West Bank town
of Ramallah to protest the death of an 16-year-old supporter of
Arafat's Fatah faction who was shot in the head in clashes
following a raid of Fatah headquarters in the city by Palestinian
military intelligence.
	   Intelligence agents were searching for illegal weapons in the
Fatah offices, though it was not immediately clear whether Sunday's
raid was part of an internal feud or a first sign that Arafat is
honoring a promise in the agreement to confiscate illegal weapons.
	   Meanwhile, the Palestinians made it clear that they have not
relinquished one of their main bargaining chips _ the threat to
declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999 _ if Israel fails to
implement the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said that the Palestinians
were ``still committed to a May 4 announcement.''

Mary Servaes-Beij, queen of Dutch tearjerkers, dead at 79
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Mary Servaes-Beij, the Dutch
tearjerker queen whose trademark sentimental tunes sold more than
16 million copies, has died. She was 79.
	   Best known simply as the ``Singer Without a Name,'' Servaes-Beij
died Friday of cardiac arrest in a nursing home in the southern
Dutch town of Horn. She had long suffered from Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases.
	   Servaes-Beij's repertoire included some 600 popular folk songs
such as ``Oh Daddy Dear,'' ``Mexico'' and ``Mandolin in Nicosia,''
many containing doleful lyrics mirroring her own difficult life.
	   She was born in the western Dutch city of Leiden in 1919, the
eighth of 10 children. Plagued by a hip disease, she was often
bedridden. ``Bitter poverty, an abusive father and bad health _ she
was spared little,'' the daily De Volkskrant wrote Monday.
	   Many of the sorrows in her life naturally found their way into
her songs.
	   In one of her hits, she sings with a trembling voice:
	   ``Oh, daddy dear drink no more,
	   ``I've asked for so many times,
	   ``For mummy cries time and time again
	   ``Oh, daddy dear drink no more.''
	   Servaes-Beij will be buried in the southern Dutch town of
Stramproy on Friday. Family details were not disclosed.

Two Jordanians arrested in Syria, complicating bigger release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Syrian authorities arrested two Jordanians,
complicating efforts to secure the release of hundreds of others
who were either detained or went missing in the Syrian capital.
	   Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh told reporters on Monday that
Jordan is ``in contact with Syrian authorities regarding the Sunday
arrest of the two Jordanian engineers.''
	   He declined to identify them or disclose other details. Other
government officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Jordan says more than 500 Jordanians in Syria have been jailed
without trial in the past few years or went missing during business
or private visits. Some are government officials.
	   Syria has not admitted it has any Jordanian detainees _ an issue
which has worsened already lukewarm relations between the
neighbors.
	   A Jordanian group comprising of the family members of Jordanians
in Syria, lawyers and political activists says the detainees are
held at Palmyra and Maza jails near Damascus.
	   It said the detainees were either affiliated with Marxist
Palestinian groups or Jordan's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood
Movement, whose branch in Syria was outlawed in the 1970s.
	   Some were members of the National Command of Syria's ruling
Baath Party who were detained following the coup that brought
President Hafez Assad to power in 1971.
	   Relations with Syria chilled when Jordan signed a peace treaty
with Israel in 1994. Damascus says the accord weakened its
bargaining position in peace negotiations with Israel.

Thai troops kill four Cambodian soldiers at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai soldiers killed four Cambodian
government troops Monday in a brief gunfight on Thai territory,
said a senior Thai army officer monitoring border security.
	   One Thai soldier was wounded in the leg in the fighting, one
kilometer (0.6 miles) from the border in Thailand's northeastern
Sisaket province, said the officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Thai military task force for the border region suspected the
intruding soldiers were involved in efforts to force Cambodian
refugees in the area to return home, he said. Most of the 14,866
Cambodians at the Pusing refugee camp are family members of
guerrillas belonging to the nearly defunct Khmer Rouge rebel
movement.
	   ``We have heard that the Phnom Penh government has offered
reward money to their troops if they could get the refugees back to
Cambodian soil,'' the officer said.
	   Low-level fighting continues in the area because the remaining
Khmer Rouge forces refuse to come to terms with the Phnom Penh
government.
	   ``In this kind of warfare, it's important to have the control of
civilians,'' said the officer.
	   The Thai army suspected that the troops who intruded Monday
carried out their mission without instructions from the government
in Phnom Penh, he said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Wrapped in white shrouds, a dozen
people accused of dabbling in black magic recited Islamic prayers
in a test to see whether they were sorcerers.
	   According to belief, they would die on the spot if guilty. If
innocent, preachers said, they would escape the wrath of God and
were free to return to their homes.
	   The suspects survived. Despite their relief after the mosque
ceremony Sunday in the town of Panti in eastern Java island, fear
grips much of the region after a wave of mysterious attacks that
many villagers believe is tied to occult forces.
	   More than 150 people have died, some of them Muslim clerics
accused of sorcery. Police have set up checkpoints at night, and
groups of civilians armed with sickles roam streets.
	   On Saturday, mobs went on a rampage after police refused to turn
over a suspect in the killing spree. Angry residents in the town of
Pasuruan tried to seize a mentally ill homeless man who was being
held in a police car.
	   Police fired warning shots to fend off the stone-throwing crowd,
which damaged the car, some shops and several cash machines, the
newspaper Media Indonesia said. Two people were injured and four
were arrested.
	   Vigilante groups have roamed the streets of Pasuruan, 750
kilometers (470 miles) east of Jakarta, and other towns in their
search for the assailants. They have often targeted mentally ill
people, who have become the scapegoats for the terror.
	   About 330 people have been arrested and 22 people convicted in
mob attacks have been sentenced to five years in prison.
	   The dozen people who were forced to recite prayers from Islam's
holy book, the Koran, had taken refuge in a police station to
escape attack.

United Nations envoy due in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A special United Nations envoy will
arrive in Myanmar Tuesday for talks with leaders of the military
government, a U.N. official said.
	   Alvaro de Soto, an assistant U.N. secretary-general, will make a
four-day visit, said the official, who asked not to be named.
	   The office of the U.N. Development Program, which coordinates
the international agency's activities in Myanmar, did not release
details of the planned visit, saying it had been arranged by the
Foreign Affairs Ministry.
	   De Soto last visited Myanmar, also known as Burma, in January in
a failed effort to facilitate a dialogue between the ruling State
Peace and Development Council and Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the
opposition National League for Democracy.
	   De Soto met the council chairman, Gen. Than Shwe, and other
senior government leaders, as well as Suu Kyi during his January
visit.
	   Relations between the government and the opposition deteriorated
afterward, with the military increasing its repression of the
pro-democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party increasing its
challenges to the government's legitimacy.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.
	   Western nations, including the United States, and private groups
such as Amnesty International say the junta is responsible for
substantial human rights abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Commission
also has reported abuses and sought to encourage governmental
reforms in Myanmar.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
canceled a visit to Vienna for talks with European Union officials,
the Austria Press Agency reported Monday.
	   Yeltsin was due here Tuesday for the EU-Russia summit. He and EU
officials were to discuss Russia's economic crisis as well as
Kosovo and other European issues.
	   In a dispatch from Luxembourg, APA quoted a foreign ministry
spokesman, Johannes Peterlik, as saying the Austrian government was
informed Monday that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would be
making the visit instead.
	   No reason was given for the cancellation. Monday is Austria's
main national holiday and officials here could not be reached for
comment.
	   In Moscow, Primakov's spokesman Andrei Korotkov said he had no
information on the report.
	   Peterlik was in Luxembourg for a meeting of EU foreign ministry
officials.

Execution team ready for Philippines' first execution in two
</HEADLINE>
decades &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Prison officials said Monday a
39-member team is ready to carry out the first execution of a
criminal in the Philippines in two decades.
	   Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of repeatedly
raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, is the first of more than 700
death-row inmates scheduled to die under a law that restored
capital punishment in 1994.
	   His impending execution by lethal injection has triggered a
debate on the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   National prison superintendent Venjo Tesoro said the team, which
he heads, is composed of medical technicians who will administer
the lethal injection and examine the inmate, security personnel and
a priest.
	   The team has been trained at a lethal injection chamber outside
the national prison in Muntinlupa City, south of Manila, where the
execution is to take place.
	   Echegaray's lawyers said they plan to file a final appeal before
the Supreme Court after several other petitions delayed but failed
to stop the execution.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, upheld Echegaray's death sentence last year.
	   Echegaray's lawyers previously tried to stop the execution by
questioning the constitutionality of lethal injections.
	   Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that lethal injections are an
acceptable method of carrying out the death penalty, removing the
last obstacle to Echegaray's execution.
	   A local court that tried Echegaray said it is awaiting Supreme
Court authorization so it can set a date for the execution.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Philippine Roman Catholic Church leaders and other civic groups
oppose the death penalty, arguing there is no concrete proof that
it deters crime. Opponents also say the poor are disadvantaged
because they cannot afford good lawyers for their defense.
	   Proponents say it is still too early for the death penalty to
serve as a deterrent to crime because no one has been executed
under the new law.
	   A spokesman said President Joseph Estrada was sticking to an
earlier decision not to pardon Echegaray.
	   ``He has indicated a preference against granting clemency. The
death penalty has to be applied,'' said presidential spokesman
Jerry Barican.

West Indies seeks return to form in Wills Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-Wills Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Short of three front-line bowlers but
high on spirit, the West Indies team is looking for a return from
the sidelines of international cricket as it gears for its first
Wills Cup match against Pakistan this week, captain Brian Lara said
Monday.
	   Lara will be without Courtney Walsh, Ian Bishop and Curtly
Ambrose but the team for the match on Thursday is the best
available, he told reporters.
	   Lara said Pakistan was a good side but lacked consistency. The
teams clash on Thursday.
	   ``They are beatable and our bowlers should be able to do their
job,'' he added.
	   The West Indies bowling attack will be led by the relatively
inexperienced Merv Dillon and Nixon McLean, backed by spinner Carl
Hooper.
	   The other participants in the dlrs 100,000 Wills International
Cup are Zimbabwe, New Zealand, England, Australia, India, South
Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies.

Cyprus orders probe into police beatings of illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The government ordered an investigation
Monday into the police beating of illegal immigrants who rioted
last week after learning some of them would be deported.
	   Attorney General Alecos Markides told state radio that he
appointed two investigators to carry out the probe. The move
followed charges by human rights groups on the Mediterranean island
that police used excessive force in putting down the protest.
	   Police said Friday that the immigrants, thought to number
between 30 and 50, set their blankets ablaze in a block of cells in
the southern town of Larnaca where they have been held since
August.
	   Riot police used tear gas and the ``necessary force'' to break
up the riot, in which two immigrants and a police officer were
hospitalized for respiratory problems, police said.
	   Local television stations, however, showed several policemen
repeatedly hitting an immigrant on the ground with truncheons and
another immigrant being led away with blood covering his face.
	   The immigrants are among a group of more than 110 rescued from a
Syrian trawler in June that had drifted in the Mediterranean for
nine days. The immigrants, most of them from the Middle East and
Africa, paid thousands of dollars to be taken to Italy or Greece.
	   Last August, police moved up to 50 of the immigrants to Larnaca
in preparation for their deportation after the United Nations
determined that they did not qualify for refugee status.

Yeltsin at country residence preparing for trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Austrian report trip canceled. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin worked at his country
residence on Monday in preparation for a trip to Austria, his press
secretary said.
	   The Austrian Press Agency said Yeltsin had canceled the one-day
trip. It quoted Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Johannes
Peterlik as saying Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would come
instead.
	   Yeltsin's office refused to comment on the report and Primakov's
spokesman, Andrei Korotkov, said he had no information.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has recovered from the respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this month.
But he has still not returned to work full time in the Kremlin, and
he is limiting his Austrian trip to one day instead of the two
originally planned.
	   Press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working Monday
at his Gorky-9 residence outside of Moscow, getting ready for his
trip to Vienna on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeltsin's agenda in Vienna includes a meeting with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two are expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin was quoted as telling an Austrian newspaper that he was
``absolutely convinced'' that Russia would overcome its problems.
	   ``We will move neither from the reforms which are directed
toward the building of socially oriented market economy, nor from
further democratization of society,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Neue Kronen Zeitung newspaper.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin is also scheduled to meet with International
Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss economic
assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Officials accompanying Yeltsin will sign a number of economic
agreements that should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment
to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has serious
health problems.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced his
first political test Monday following his land-for-security deal
with the Palestinians, with parliament likely to defeat a motion of
no confidence in the government. However, another _ perhaps more
serious _ threat to Netanyahu's rule appeared on the horizon, with
parliament's Law Committee convening to discuss an early elections
bill. Monday's motion of no confidence was submitted by the
far-right opposition party Moledet which rejects the agreement with
the Palestinians. Netanyahu was expected to survive the vote, since
the dovish opposition said it would not vote with Moledet. Still,
the opposition, led by Labor Party chief Ehud Barak, appeared to be
divided over whether to bring down Netanyahu as quickly as possible
or to wait until the promised West Bank troop withdrawal is carried
out. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Before a packed High Court Monday. lawyers for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued that the former Chilean dictator's
arrest on a Spanish warrant is illegal because ex-rulers have
immunity from prosecution for acts committed in an ``official
capacity.'' He said the warrant issued by a Spanish magistrate was
also illegal because Pinochet is not Spanish. As Nicholls led a
phalanx of lawyers appearing for Pinochet, a Chilean military
aircraft with medical personnel and equipment was on standby at
Brize Norton, a Royal Air Force base northwest of London, to take
the 82-year-old general home if he wins the case. The hearing was
expected to last through part of Tuesday. British police arrested
Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed in a private London clinic at the
instigation of the Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule
which ended 1990. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo roads Monday as the Yugoslav government tried to
convince NATO it is meeting the deadline for complying with the
peace deal to avoid airstrikes. In Brussels, Belgium, NATO
ambassadors were hearing a briefing Monday from the alliance's
military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he pressed President Slobodan Milosevic for further
troop withdrawals from the Kosovo province. Oct. 12 is NATO's
latest deadline for Milosevic to comply an agreement or face
airstrikes. NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or
returned to barracks so that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return to their homes safely.
The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying the with
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim Serb-led forces
withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return after they
leave to harass civilians. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The leader of Afghanistan's Taliban
army has launched a judicial inquiry into allegations of terrorism
against Osama bin Laden, a spokesman said Monday. The inquiry was
set up by a decree issued by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's
reclusive leader and self-declared Amir ul-Momineen or leader of
the Muslim faithful. The United States charges bin Laden
masterminded the deadly bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East
Africa in August that killed more than 200 people and wounded
thousands others. Bin Laden, a millionaire Saudi Arabian, was
exiled from his homeland after threatening to overthrow the Saudi
monarchy for allowing U.S. soldiers to be stationed in Saudi
Arabia, home to Islam's two holiest sites at Mecca and Medina. An
Aug. 20 U.S. cruise missile attack on eastern Afghanistan aimed at
suspected terrorist camps belonging to bin Laden killed 26 people
were killed, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers say. (AFGHANISTAN-BIN

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed Basque separatists
declared a cease-fire, regional elections have shown voters still
sharply divided over creating an independent Basque state in
northern Spain. With 99.7 percent of Sunday's vote counted, the
pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party had won 21 of Basque
Parliament's 75 seats, earning the right to form the next area
government. Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the militant ETA,
gained three seats for a total of 14, said Basque Interior Minister
Jose Maria Atutxa. Two national parties with branches in the Basque
country opposed to independence _ The Socialist Party and Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's ruling Popular Party won 30 seats
between them. Analysts said the results reflect a profound rift in
the prosperous, picturesque region, which is home to one of Western
Europe's last regional armed rebels. (SPAIN-BASQUE-ELECTION)

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly lower Monday,
with share prices tumbling in Tokyo on profit-taking. Tokyo's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 301.24 points, or
2.13 percent, closing at 13,843.46. Investors took profits
following the Nikkei's 10 percent surge in the five days leading up
to Friday. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.02 yen in
late afternoon, down 0.12 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above
its New York level of 117.95 yen late Friday. Bucking the trend of
lower markets across Asia was the Philippine Stock Exchange, where
the key index surged 4.1 percent on the back of a stronger peso and
expectations of a further softening of domestic interest rates. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 62.42 points to
1,586.40. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
efforts to halt Brazil's growing economic turmoil have received a
strong boost with the election of a key ally as governor of
Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state. Of the 13
gubernatorial runoff elections Sunday, Sao Paulo's was perhaps the
most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity measures,
expected to be announced Tuesday. The measures, which include
spending cuts and tax hikes, must be approved by Congress, and
state governors have enormous sway over local delegations. Sao
Paulo's incumbent governor Mario Covas was re-elected to a second
term in office with 56 percent of the vote against 44 percent
tallied for two-time former governor Paulo Maluf. Sao Paulo,
Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, has a population of
more than 34 million _ nearly equal to all of neighboring
Argentina. It alone accounts for more than one-third of Brazil's
economic output. (BRAZIL-ELECTay. Lee did not
predict, as many international analysts have done, that Singapore
would fall into a full recession next year, for the first time
since 1985-86. But he left open the possibility. Growth next year
``could be slightly positive or slightly negative,'' he said.
Recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative Gross
Domestic Product. Singapore's economy is clearly shrinking
dramatically, with growth at 1.6 in the second quarter of this
year, down from 6.1 percent in the first quarter.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers were on strike in several French
cities on Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation. The latest walkouts affected transit lines in
Paris, Marseille, Lille and Chambery, officials said. The Paris A
line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the west and east
including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a train driver was
injured in the financial district of La Defense on Sunday. Only one
in five commuter trains were in service around the southern port of
Marseille on the second day of a walkout, officials said. Other
attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille bus
drivers, who began returning to work Monday. Transit workers have
demanded that the government put more police on buses, subway cars
and commuter trains to halt the attacks, part of a rising crime
rate among unemployed youths from working class suburbs.

	   VAIL, Colorado (AP) _ Militant environmental activists in the
United States used to target mining and logging, the traditional
industries that built the West. Now they're going after tourism,
torching a mountaintop building at the busiest U.S. ski resort to
protest development of wilderness areas. Targeting so-called
``industrial tourism,'' the Earth Liberation Front admitted setting
fires last week that caused more than dlrs 12 million in damage.
The goal: to halt another expansion of Vail because of fears it
could harm a potential habitat for the lynx, a threatened species
of mountain cat. The mainstream environmental movement denounced
the arson, but some are surprised such an attack didn't happen
sooner. ``I know in my heart there has been an environmental
time-bomb waiting to go off in Vail and other ski areas for a long
time,'' said environmental writer J.D. Braselton. (US-TOURISM AS

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Basque regional elections, the first held
since armed separatists declared a cease-fire five weeks ago,
opened the door wider to peace, the Spanish government said Monday.
	   Basques crowded the polls in record numbers Sunday, favoring the
more extreme versions of the region's traditional split between
those who seek independence and those who oppose it.
	   But Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told national Spanish
radio that the result was ``the best possible for peace,'' because
the Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was now an
undisputed major force within the regional Basque Parliament.
	   Mayor Oreja said that with the rise of the Popular Party, the
Basque parliament could not disregard that ``plurality is the
essence of the Basque Country.''
	   The government has not indicated what Aznar's next step will be.
He had taken a tough stance since the armed separatist group ETA
declared an open-ended cease-fire, insisting that the group accept
the election results and give up its arms for talks to go forward.
	   ETA supporters have urged the government, as a gesture of
goodwill, to transfer separatist prisoners scattered around the
country to institutions in the Basque country.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, politically allied with the ETA commandos,
said the election favored independence. The party is a new name for
the traditional Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The party spokesman, Arnaldo Otegi, told the Barcelona daily La
Vanguardia that the strong support for Basque nationalist parties
was a vote for ``peace, liberty and self-determination,''
	   Otegi said his party would not join any coalition government,
but would be an active participant in Parliament, La Vanguardia
reported Monday.
	   Although the lineup in the 75-seat Parliament between
pro-independence and anti-independence seats basically stayed the
same, there were important changes in the makeup on each side of
the aisle.
	   The voters, more than 70 percent of those registered turned out,
cast ballots giving three separatist parties a total of 41 seats
and four parties opposed to breaking up Spanish union, 35 seats,
similar to the existing lineup.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist (separatist) Party dropped a
seat, but won 21, enough to give it the right to form the
government.
	   Juan Jose Ibarretxe, Nationalist Party leader charged with
seeking a coalition government, said Monday, ``Let's see what we
can do in this country without excluding anybody.''
	   But the political map's variations are what encouraged Mayor
Oreja and others to see the elections as the curtain raiser to a
more vigorous peace process.
	   The big winners were Aznar's Popular Party and the Euskal
Herritarrok (Herri Batasuna) political coalition linked to the ETA.
	   Aznar's Popular Party jumped from 11 to 16 seats to become the
second most popular party in the regional Parliament.
	   The party is strongly identified with the Spanish government's
tough anti-terrorist policies and totally opposed to making
concessions to ETA or changing the constitution to allow Basque
secession.
	   The Socialist Party, the main opposition to Aznar's government
in the national parliament but on the same side of the fence in the
Basque country, gained two seats to total 14, although it fell from

	   Euskal Herritarrok gained two seats to 14, becoming the third

Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since 1968, but

Report: Dutch striker ready to return to Nottingham Forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Pierre van Hooijdonk, the Dutch
striker who has refused to play for Nottingham Forest this season
because of a contract dispute, is about to return to the club, a
Dutch newspaper reported Monday.
	   Van Hooijdonk reached an agreement with the club last week and
straightened out the last details in a telephone conversation
Sunday night with Forest manager Dave Basset, the Algemeen Dagblad
reported.
	   ``I'm going to do my very best for the club,'' Van Hooijdonk
told the Algemeen Dagblad. ``The club needs me _ it's second from
bottom in the league.''
	   Van Hooijdonk, whose goals last season helped lead Forest win
promotion back to the Premier Division, was refused a summer
transfer by the club and has refused to play ever since.
	   He is currently keeping in shape by training with his old Dutch
club NAC Breda.
	   ``I want to show that I haven't lost any of my quality,'' he
said.
	   Without the tall striker, Forest has made a disastrous start to
the season. It stands 19th in the 20-team Premiership and has
scored just seven goals in 10 matches.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The body of a man believed to be an
Israeli was thrown from a moving car in the Israeli-controlled area
of Hebron on Monday, said Palestinian reporters who witnessed the
incident.
	   The man was dressed like a jogger, wearing white shorts, blue
shirts and one tennis shoe. His sunglasses were held around his
neck by a black strap with Hebrew writing. Rivulets of blood were
flowing from several areas of the body.

Long-forgotten amateur movies of Hitler found in U.S. home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Four reels of amateur movies shot by
Adolf Hitler's personal pilot showing the Nazi leader touring
occupied Paris and consoling war wounded have surfaced in the
Tennessee basement of a former U.S. Army officer, a newsmagazine
reported Monday.
	   Sgt. Herbert St. Goar headed an intelligence branch of the U.S.
military government in Germany when he came across the 12 tin cans
containing the movies in the winter of 1945-46, Der Spiegel
reported.
	   Most were sent back to the War Ministry in Washington, but four
he sent home to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where they eventually ended
up gathering dust in his basement.
	   The candid movies show Hitler's travels around Europe in the
1930s, from meetings with Benito Mussolini in Rome in 1938 to a
quick tour of just-occupied Paris on June 28, 1940.
	   The Paris trip includes the only known shots in color of Hitler
visiting with German war wounded, Spiegel said. Such scenes were
usually not allowed by the German Propaganda Ministry.
	   Der Spiegel said St. Goar recently remembered the rolls of film
and decided to make them available to researchers.
	   Hans Guenther Voigt from the Berlin Federal Film Archive called
the reels ``authentic'' and ``extremely interesting as
contemporaneous documentation.''
	   Christian Hartmann from the Munich Institute for Contemporary
History called them ``an important addition'' to other film
material about Hitler.

Reports: British nurse seeks meeting with murder victim's brother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Gilford and his lawyer, CORRECTS
spelling to McLauchlan throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A British nurse jailed in the killing
of an Australian colleague in Saudi Arabia wants to meet the
victim's brother to apologize for past animosity and to gather
evidence that may quash her conviction, reports said Monday.
	   In interviews from Dundee, Scotland, with The Australian
newspaper and the Australian Broadcasting Corp., Lucille McLauchlan
said she wants to personally express her sympathies to Frank
Gilford for the murder of his sister Yvonne in a hospital in Saudi
Arabia in December 1996.
	   She also said Gilford has banking records that may prove her
innocence.
	   McLauchlan, 32, was convicted of being an accessory to Gilford's
murder and was sentenced to eight years in prison and 500 lashes. A
second British nurse, Deborah Parry, was convicted of the murder
and sent to death row.
	   For months, Gilford refused to rule out exercising his right to
call for the death penalty. He eventually received U.S. dlrs 1
million (1.7 million Australian dollars) compensation for waiving
that right.
	   Parry and McLauchlan were released in May after Saudi King Fahd
commuted their sentences to the 17 months already served in prison.
	   ``I would like the opportunity, obviously if Mr. Gilford was in
agreement, to meet (him) and basically apologize for what's
happened to Yvonne,'' McLauchlan told the ABC.
	   ``I state I was not responsible for Yvonne's death.''
	   McLauchlan said she was sorry for saying in a diary written in
prison that Gilford was a ``greedy, selfish bastard,'' explaining
that reports she heard of Gilford's position were inaccurate.
	   ``I cannot deny that I felt very angry with him when I was in
prison in Saudi Arabia,'' McLauchlan said in The Australian.
	   ``When Frank Gilford's lawyer stood up in court in May 1997 and
said that his client wanted to exercise his right to call for the
death penalty my blood chilled.
	   ``Up until then, I had heard the expression before but I never
knew what it meant until that moment. My heart sank into my
stomach, my blood froze and I literally went numb. I could not
believe that somebody would want your head cut off _ not on the
basis of the pathetic evidence against me.''
	   McLauchlan said that since her release, her lawyers and family
had collected a large amount of evidence to prove her innocence.
	   ``We believe (Frank Gilford) has evidence that could clear me,''
she told The Australian.
	   Gilford said Monday there was no way he would meet McLauchlan,
accusing her of seeking seeking to boost sales of a book she has
written about her experience.
	   ``I just believe she's out to get publicity for her book,''
Gilford said on commercial television.
	   Gilford's lawyer Michael Abbott said a precondition for any
meeting should be that McLauchlan explain her involvement in Yvonne
Gilford's slaying.
	   Evidence used in the Saudi court included that Parry and
McLauchlan had used bank cards belonging to Yvonne Gilford shortly
after the murder.
	   ``I completely deny ever having Yvonne's bank cards after her
death and I understand that (Frank Gilford) has her bank records
for that period.
	   ``The Saudis maintain that they show withdrawals of 5,000 riyals
(about U.S. dlrs 8,600) but if they do not, a large part of the
case against me fails.''
	   McLauchlan confirmed she and Parry had fallen out since their
release from prison.
	   ``All I can say is that since Deborah's returned home her
campaign to prove her innocence has basically focused on
discrediting me and believing some of the Saudi evidence ...
against me,'' McLauchlan told the ABC.
	   ``I now find myself in the situation where I'm defending myself
not against the Saudis but against Deborah Parry.'

Dutch cycling union chairman calls for release of TVM team leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The chairman of the Royal Dutch
Cycling Union Monday called on French authorities to allow a
cycling team leader arrested during this summer's Tour de France to
return home.
	   Cees Priem has not been allowed to leave France since July 23
when he and TVM team doctor Andrei Mikhailov were arrested
following the discovery of drugs in the team's hotel.
	   TVM cyclists were taken to a hospital in Albertville for
extensive medical checks and later dropped out of the Tour saying
they did not have the physical or mental strength to finish the
race.
	   Royal Dutch Cycling Union President Joop Atsma said in an
interview published in Monday's De Telegraaf newspaper that Priem
has been held too long.
	   ``We've waited long enough,'' he said. ``Our patience with the
French is running out. It is time for the Foreign Minister to tell
our ambassador in Paris to express our displeasure.''
	   An investigating judge is due to review the case Tuesday and
could order the release of Priem who has been placed under formal
investigation, a step short of being formally charged.
	   Although Priem was freed from jail in August, he was not allowed
to leave France and must report daily to police.
	   Atsma, a Christian Democrat member of Dutch parliament, said
there is support across parliament for action to relieve ``Priem's
hopeless looking situation.''
	   Atsma even suggested French authorities were holding Priem to
protest the Dutch government's liberal drugs policy, which often
has led to diplomatic rows between the two nations.
	   The investigation of the TVM team actually began last March,
when French customs agents found about 100 doses of EPO, which
increases oxygen to the red blood cells, in a team car.
	   But that find only came to light following the outbreak of the
scandal involving the Festina team which was kicked off the Tour
after some of its riders admitted taking performance enhancing
drugs.

Austria Press Agency says Yeltsin cancels Vienna visit

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
canceled a visit to Vienna for talks with European Union officials,
the Austria Press Agency reported Monday.
	   Yeltsin was due here Tuesday for the EU-Russia summit. He and EU
officials were to discuss Russia's economic crisis as well as
Kosovo and other European issues.
	   APA gave no reason was given for the cancellation. Monday is
Austria's main national holiday and most officials here could not
be reached for comment.
	   But a source in Chancellor Viktor Klima's office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed that Yeltsin would not be coming.
He said an official statement had been delayed because authorized
spokesmen were busy with national holiday festivities.
	   Yeltsin, 67, had been suffering from a respiratory infection
that forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this
month. Doctors pronounced him fit after a medical checkup last
week, but the Russian president still has not returned to work full
time in the Kremlin.
	   In a dispatch from Luxembourg, APA quoted a foreign ministry
spokesman, Johannes Peterlik, as saying the Austrian government was
told Monday that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would be making
the visit instead.
	   Peterlik was in Luxembourg for a meeting of EU foreign ministry
officials.
	   In Moscow, Primakov's spokesman Andrei Korotkov said he had no
information on the report. Yeltsin's press secretary said earlier
that Yeltsin was working at his country residence, preparing for
the Austrian trip.
	   On Sunday, the Vienna newspaper Die Neue Kronen Zeitung
published an interview with Yeltsin in which he repeated claims
that Moscow will not veer from its reform program despite its
economic crisis.
	   But Yeltsin added that ``reforms must be made in the interests
of the majority of the people and have broad political support.''
	   He also dismissed concerns in the West that Russia might
secretly sell nuclear materials and technology to would-be nuclear
powers as a ``bad joke.''
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but the Interfax news agency said today
that a visit to India in December was still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli lawmakers discussed a bill Monday that
calls for early elections and were considering a no-confidence vote
over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's signing of a new Mideast
peace deal.
	   Hanan Porat, chairman of parliament's Law Committee and a
staunch opponent of the deal to grant Palestinians land in exchange
for security assurances, said he expected a majority of his panel
to approve the early elections bill and send it to parliament.
	   ``I believe that the process we are beginning will conclude with
the dispersal of parliament and early elections ... around February
or March,'' Porat told Israel radio. Three readings are required
for the bill to become law.
	   Netanyahu also faces a no-confidence motion in the 120-seat
parliament submitted by the tiny, extreme right-wing Moledet party,
which opposes peace with the Palestinians. The Knesset begins
debating the motion later Monday.
	   Netanyahu is expected to easily beat the no-confidence motion
with the help of Israel's dovish Labor party. Still, Labor appeared
divided over whether to bring down Netanyahu as quickly as possible
or wait until the West Bank troop withdrawal is carried out.
	   Parliament Speaker Dan Tichon scheduled a two-day debate on the
peace accord, starting Nov. 3. Parliament was expected to approve
the deal with Labor's support.
	   Under the agreement, Israel has 12 weeks to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in exchange for an accelerated Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants. The clock starts ticking next week.
	   Monday is Netanyahu's first day back at work after returning
from the grueling nine-day summit in Maryland where he and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat renewed the peace deal.
	   Netanyahu postponed a Cabinet session until Wednesday,
apparently concerned he didn't have the necessary support yet among
his ministers.
	   In an interview Monday with Israel army radio, Netanyahu said he
got assurances from the United States that Palestinians who kill
Israelis would serve long terms. ``We know that all ... will do
time for dozens of years,'' he said.
	   The prime minister also said Israel retained the right to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Army radio reported that the government would soon begin
construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, apparently to blunt hard-line
opposition to a withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu did not deny the report, saying only that he hadn't
decided when to start building. ``We have said that building will
take place in Har Homa by 2000, and this will happen,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu also issued a stern warning to Arafat that no land
would be handed over unless Palestinians make good on their
security commitments.
	   ``With the completion of each step, they will receive. They give
and only then we give,'' Netanyahu said Sunday night.
	   Honoring the deal won't be easy for Arafat, either.
	   On Monday, a general strike was held in the West Bank town of
Ramallah to protest the death of a 16-year-old supporter of
Arafat's Fatah faction who was shot in the head during a raid of
Fatah headquarters by Palestinian military intelligence.
	   Intelligence agents were searching for illegal weapons in the
Fatah offices. It was not immediately clear whether Sunday's raid
was part of an internal feud or a sign that Arafat is honoring a
promise in the agreement to confiscate illegal weapons.
	   Meanwhile, the Palestinians made it clear that they have not
relinquished one of their main bargaining chips _ the threat to
declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999 _ if Israel fails to
implement the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians were
``still committed to a May 4 announcement.''

	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin was quoted as telling an Austrian newspaper that he was
``absolutely convinced'' that Russia would overcome its problems.
	   ``We will move neither from the reforms which are directed
toward the building of socially oriented market economy, nor from
further democratization of society,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Neue Kronen Zeitung newspaper.
	   Yeltsin's itinerary also called for him to meet with
International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss
economic assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Other Russian officials, who will now accompany Primakov, were
expected to sign a number of economic agreements that should bring
dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has serious
health problems.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

Kinkel bids farewell, gives vote of confidence to Fischer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Klaus Kinkel met for the last time as German
foreign minister with his European Union counterparts Monday and
assured them his successor, Joschka Fischer, would pursue the same
foreign policy.
	   ``I am certain that the main pillars of German foreign policy
will remain in place,'' he told a news conference at an EU foreign
ministers' meeting in Luxembourg.
	   Fischer will formally replace Kinkel as German foreign minister
during a ceremony on Wednesday, a day after Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder's new center-left government is sworn in.
	   Kinkel, who has held the post for more than six years, said the
handover was running smoothly and that he had met with Fischer many
times over the past few days to brief him on issues such as the
conflict in Kosovo and EU enlargement.
	   Kinkel said he was leaving office with a feeling of concern for
the situation in Russia and the Ukraine.
	   Kinkel was due to leave Luxembourg after a lunch with EU
counterparts during which the ministers will be discussing the
results of the weekend summit in Poertschach, Austria.

Hong Kong discloses government stock holdings

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two months after a highly controversial foray
into the stock and futures markets, Hong Kong's investment company
disclosed Monday that the government spent the equivalent of U.S.
dlrs 15.1 billion in its unprecedented buying spree.
	   The government bought shares in all 33 stocks that make up the
blue chip Hang Seng Index, officials said after the market had
closed Monday.
	   The government's holdings include stakes of more than 10 percent
in three big companies _ the property conglomerates Cheung Kong
Holdings and New World Development, and the aviation-to-insurance
holding company Swire Pacific A.
	   Hong Kong officials may have jolted markets and drawn harsh
criticism by their intervention _ which they say was intended to
halt speculative assaults on the territory's markets _ but they
also have shown they aren't the best stock pickers.
	   Since the end of August, when the government stopped buying
shares, Hong Kong's stock market has gained 34 percent in value,
while the government's shares increased by only 24 percent,
according to an analysis by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng index closed down 38.84 points Monday at
9,778.91 _ but it remains 47 percent higher than the five-year low
of 6,660.42 that it hit on Aug. 14, the day before the intervention
began.
	   After coming under sharp attack from critics who warned that the
intervention could ruin Hong Kong's status as a free-wheeling
market, Hong Kong officials promised to be more open. Opposition
politicians also criticized the government for spending billions in
the market without consulting the legislature.
	   In the future, any changes in shareholdings of 1 percent or more
will be disclosed, said Ti-Liang Yang, chairman of the Exchange
Fund Investment Ltd., which was set up to manage the government's
stock holdings.
	   In a two-week period in August, the government snapped up the
shares in an effort to drive what it called ``market manipulators''
out of the stock, futures and currency markets.
	   Hong Kong officials contended that big investors were selling
the Hong Kong dollar, which forced monetary authorities to raise
interest rates to preserve the currency's fixed link with the U.S.
dollar.
	   At the same time, the speculators were selling shares on the
Hong Kong stock market, then cashing in when the higher interest
rates helped to push shares lower.
	   The government later introduced a series of regulations to
restrict speculative activity and stabilize the markets.
	   The government's stock holdings had previously remained an
official secret because disclosure regulations did not apply,
although many investment banks have tried to estimate the figures.
	   The widely anticipated official disclosure of Hong Kong's stock
portfolio is not expected to send the market diving or rallying,
analysts say.
	   ``Much of this strikes me as clarification rather than major
revelation,'' said David Shairp, head of Asian economics at Paribas
Asia Equity Ltd.
	   The Exchange Fund Investment will not try to make money by
actively trading shares, but will try to maintain the value of the
shares before selling them over a long period of time, Yang said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin canceled a one-day
trip to Austria on his doctors' advice, the Interfax news agency
said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip on Tuesday
instead, Interfax said, quoting presidential press spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. Doctors said last
week he had recovered, but Yeltsin had still not returned to work
at the Kremlin full time and he had reduced the trip to Vienna to
one day from the originally scheduled two days.
	   Yakushkin said earlier Monday that the Russian leader was
working at a country residence outside of Moscow and was preparing
for the trip to Austria.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP)_ Spanish club Betis was searching for a
little stability Monday after losing its third coach since the end
of last season with the resignation of Vicente Cantatore.
	   Chilean Cantatore presented his resignation late Sunday after
Betis took a 5-1 beating from Valencia and fell to bottom-place in
the Spanish premier league.
	   With seven rounds played Betis has only managed to garner five
points, despite some notable international stars including the
world's most expensive player Denilson of Brazil. Betis finished
No. 8 last season.
	   Club chairman Manuel Ruiz de Lopera told reporters he had
accepted Cantatore's resignation because the former coach of
Chile's national squad ``has nothing more to offer the club,''
	   National Spanish radio reported that Cantatore's replacement
could be announced later Monday. The radio floated the possibility
that the recently sacked Spanish national coach Javier Clemente was
in the running for the job.
	   Cantatore took over at Betis with just three days to go before
the start of the Spanish league.
	   His appointment followed the surprise resignation of Portugal's
former coach Antonio Oliveira who had been at Betis for just a
month. Oliveira had joined up after Luis Aragones sent shock-waves
through the club by resigning after just a year on the job.
	   Cantatore was sacked by Spanish side Valladolid last year before
resigning from Sporting Lisbon two weeks after starting in the job
for 'personal reasons'.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The body of a man believed to be an
Israeli was thrown from a moving car in the Israeli-controlled area
of Hebron on Monday, said Palestinian reporters who witnessed the
incident.
	   Palestinian paramedics who arrived at the scene said the man had
been shot in the neck. The victim, dressed in white shorts and a
blue T-shirt, lay sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of
blood spread below the head.
	   The victim wore one tennis shoe. The black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing.
	   A group of Palestinian journalists was walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street sometime after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) when a car drove by
at high speed and someone hurled the body from the vehicle.
	   The car drove away. The journalists said they immediately
notified Israeli and Palestinian police forces. The first to arrive
at the scene was an ambulance from a nearby Palestinian hospital.
Paramedics tried to revive the victim and then declared him dead.
	   The body was dumped in a Hebron neighborhood called Shaaba,
which is in the Israeli-controlled sector of the divided city and
about 400 meters (yards) away from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat
Arba.

	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch lashed
Jamaica with heavy rain and flooded parts of the Cayman Islands
with huge sea swells Monday as it slowly plowed through the western
Caribbean.
	   The full force of Mitch's 155-mph (250-kph) winds did not strike
Jamaica and the Caymans, but rain squalls from the huge storm
flooded streets in the Jamaican capital of Kingston. Under a
tropical storm warning, hotel workers in the Caymans boarded up
windows and moved tourists to safer shelter.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a hurricane
warning for eastern Honduras, and authorities in Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula urged residents to monitor the progress of the dangerous
storm, which is between a Category 4 and Category 5 hurricane.
	   At 7 a.m. EST, Mitch was 105 miles (170 kilometers)
east-southeast of Honduras' Swan Islands and was moving west at 7
mph (11 kph). It had swelled to nearly 300 miles (480 kilometers)
across and U.S. forecasters said it could grow even stronger
Monday.
	   Honduran officials declared an alert Sunday and warned that
Mitch could hit the coast Monday. Officials prepared to evacuate
residents and asked fishermen to keep their boats in port.
	   In Grand Cayman, a British colony of about 28,000, schools
closed Monday, boat owners secured their vessels and residents
stocked up on food, water, batteries and other essentials. A
planned release of 400 endangered green sea turtle hatchlings was
postponed indefinitely.
	   ``There are guests who don't take lightly to this kind of
thing,'' said Annette Beaumont, a clerk at Morritt's Tortuga Club
and Resort on Grand Cayman, where tourists were moved to upper
floors. ``We're turning back everyone who comes, unless they can't
get a flight out.''
	   Mitch disrupted flights, flooded streets, knocked down trees and
forced church services to be canceled Sunday in Jamaica, but no
injuries were immediately reported.
	   ``We have managed to cope with what has happened,'' said Barbara
Carvy, head of Jamaica's disaster preparedness agency.
	   Sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards as squalls
pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern districts. Authorities warned
of mudslides and flash floods, especially in the mountains.
	   At a Kingston prison, guards used tear gas to quell a brief
protest by inmates upset because the storm forced authorities to
close the jail, preventing relatives from bringing food.
	   In Negril, on Jamaica's west coast, some tourists took advantage
of a choppy sea to go body surfing along the city's 7-mile-long
(11-kilometer-long) beach.
	   ``I think this is as rough as it's going to get,'' said O'mar
Robinson, manager of the Point Ciana Beach Resort, as he pointed to
waves crashing within 10 feet (3 meters) of a seaside bar.
	   The western Caribbean had been spared by Hurricane Georges, a
storm that killed more than 500 during its rampage through the
northeast Caribbean last month.

Chinese police question, detain democracy campaigners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police called in two democracy
campaigners for questioning Monday and were detaining another over
efforts to set up an opposition party, a human rights group said.
	   Li Zongshang was taken away Saturday from the home of another
dissident, and his whereabouts remained unknown Monday, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   Li was among four dissidents in central Henan province who
signed an application last week to officially register the China
Democracy Party, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said.
	   Wang Bing, another of the four, was called in by police for
questioning Monday, as was Zeng Ning, a dissident from Guizhou
province, south China, who also joined efforts to register the
party, the Information Center said.
	   Since July, dissidents have tried the register branches of the
party in at least nine provinces and major cities, challenging a
virtual 49-year ban on organized opposition to the ruling Communist
Party.
	   Authorities have rejected all the applications and detained at
least 20 dissidents who took part, mostly for short periods of
time.
	   Also Monday, Beijing police ordered the disbanding of an
independent association of intellectuals and questioned three of
the group's organizers for about three hours, the Information
Center said.
	   Police searched the offices of the China Development Union and
confiscated a fax machine, computer and documents, the center said.
Police said the group's activities were illegal because it had not
registered with authorities, the center said.

NATO discusses weekend deal that could stave off airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO has given Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic 24 hours to reduce his forces in Kosovo to pre-crisis
levels or face airstrikes, officials said. Early Monday, the Serb
leader started moving in the right direction.
	   ``He knows the direction he has to move in if he wants to avert
airstrikes,'' said a NATO officials after the 16 ambassadors were
briefed on 16 hours of weekend talks between Milosevic and two top
Alliance generals.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in Luxembourg said
that if Milosevic sticks to the deal ``that will certainly be a
significant advance, but we want to see the evidence first.''
	   Intelligence reports on Monday showed that ``there is some
indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal,'' said the
NATO official. He said NATO remained resolved to use military force
once a deadline on withdrawal runs out at 8 p.m. (1900GMT) Tuesday.
``He has to get his skates on for the next 24 hours,'' the
officials said.
	   Milosevic ``agreed in very detailed terms to the withdrawals''
during talks with NATO Generals Wesley Clark of the United States
and German General Klaus Naumann. The generals were in Belgrade
over the weekend to reinforce a strong letter from NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, stressing the Alliance would not
hesitate to use military action if necessary.
	   ``The planes are still on the runway. If Milosevic does not want
them to take off then it is up to him to comply, he knows what he
has got to do,'' said Cook ahead of a meeting of EU Foreign
Ministers.
	   NATO will assess the level of withdrawal Tuesday afternoon
before a NATO Council will meet just hours before the deadline
expires.

Day 2 at Italy's new international air hub: Still a mess
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALPENSA, Italy (AP) _ Flights four or more hours late. Waits of
up to five hours for baggage. Scarce taxis and no shuttle buses.
Not enough parking places for planes.
	   In short, the debut of Italy's new international air hub outside
Milan, Malpensa 2000, on Sunday was chaos. And things weren't much
better on Monday.
	   Day 2 dawned with passengers still waiting for planes, or bags.
Airport officials reported serious glitches in the computer
systems.
	   By midday 64 flights had been canceled and six diverted to other
airports. About 2,000 pieces of luggage were yet to be reunited
with their owners.
	   The average flight delay was predicted to be at least an hour,
with 90-minute average waits for baggage. At one point, Malpensa
was closed to air traffic for about half an hour because it had run
out of parking places for planes.
	   Airport officials have tried to make the best of things,
pointing out the chaos suffered when Hong Kong and Oslo opened new
airports this year. At the same time, they admitted to a ``series
of dysfunctions.''
	   Malpensa has been controversial from the outset, in great part
because it is much farther from Milan than the city's other
airport, Linate. The European Commission, troubled by the lack of
good rail and road links, gave Italy permission to shift flights to
Malpensa only last week.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the center of Milan,
compared to 10 kilometers (6 miles) for Linate. A rail link won't
be finished until at least mid-1999 and the widening of the
Milan-Malpensa highway won't be complete until next year.
	   With double the number of gates and check-in counters as Linate,
Malpensa is expected to handle 18 million passengers a year
compared to Linate's 10 million and 58 flights an hour compared to
Linate's 32.

Yeltsin cancels one-day trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Yeltsin suffering from extreme fatigue &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
cancel a one-day trip to Austria because of extreme fatigue, the
Interfax news agency said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip for talks
with the European Union on Tuesday instead, Interfax said, quoting
presidential press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was suffering from a condition that made
him very weak and tired.
	   The Kremlin would not comment on the report.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. Doctors said last
week he had recovered, but Yeltsin has still not returned to work
at the Kremlin full time. The trip to Vienna had been reduced to
one day from the originally scheduled two days.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has crippling
health problems.
	   Yakushkin said earlier Monday that the Russian leader was
working at a country residence outside of Moscow and was preparing
for the trip to Austria.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin was quoted as telling an Austrian newspaper that he was
``absolutely convinced'' that Russia would overcome its problems.
	   ``We will move neither from the reforms which are directed
toward the building of socially oriented market economy, nor from
further democratization of society,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Neue Kronen Zeitung newspaper.
	   Yeltsin's itinerary also called for him to meet with
International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss
economic assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Other Russian officials, who will now accompany Primakov, were
expected to sign a number of economic agreements that should bring
dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Czech military helicopter
with three officers on board that disappeared on a routine flight
was found crashed in a remote field, NATO officials said Monday.
	   The Czech Mi-17 ``Hip'' helicopter was on a routine transport
flight from Gornji Vakuf in the northwest of Bosnia to the Croatian
port of Split late Sunday when it disappeared.
	   British helicopters spotted the helicopter Monday, crashed into
a hillside near Tomislavgrad, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest
of Sarajevo, Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo
said.
	   ``At this point NATO doesn't know what the condition of the
three member crew is,'' he said.
	   The helicopter and its crew were based out of northwestern town
of Velika Kladusa, as part of the Czech Battalion which belongs to
the 36,000 strong multinational peacekeepers.
	   According to NATO the Czech brigade is preparing to launch a
rescue operation, but they have not reached the field yet, as it is
it is far from accessible roads and in an area that has not been
cleared of landmines.
	   Since NATO deployed it's multinational peace force in Bosnia
three years ago, 86 participants have died while on duty in
non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic accidents or land-mine
blasts.

Dane gives dead dad a last journey on motorbike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish man wanted to have one last
outing with his dad, so he took him for a motorcycle ride _ even
though the father had died two days earler, police said Monday.
	   Flemming Petersen, 36, went to the morgue in Frederikssund, 40
kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Copenhagen on Saturday, dressed
his father's corpse in leather motorcyle gear and smuggled it out
to his bike, where he strapped the body onto the passenger seat,
police said.
	   Several hours later, he ended the farewell journey by going to
the Frederikssund police station and turning himself in. He was
charged with indecent handling of a corpse, but was not detained.
	   The newspaper B.T. reported Monday that the ride included a
stopoff at a Copenhagen bar, where Petersen propped up the body in
a seat, stuck a cigar in its mouth, ordered a couple of beers and
had a one-sided chat.
	   Police said they could not confirm that incident and the
newspaper did not give the name of the bar.
	   ``I really felt great afterwards. It helps to be with the
deceased, to sit and chat although he couldn't hear what I was
saying,'' the newspaper quoted Petersen as saying.
	   The newspaper said that at one point during the nearly four-hour
ride, the bike stalled and Petersen passerby to help push,
explaining that his father ``had a couple of beers and was dead
tired.''
	   Petersen also reportedly stopped by his mother in Frederikssund
and took a few snapshots of the father on the bike before turning
himself in.

Youth violence causes new transit strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike in Caen after attack; Marseille workers
ending walkout; ADDS byline
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers were on strike in several cities on
Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation across France, officials said.
	   The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille,
Lille, Caen and Chambery, officials said.
	   The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the
west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a
train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on
Sunday.
	   A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a fire
extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the driver to
be hospitalized. On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45
minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
	   Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the
southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout,
officials said. The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked
on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
	   The workers voted to end their job action Monday afternoon.
	   Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille
bus drivers, who also began returning to work Monday. But employee
representatives said they would halt service after each attack in
France's second-largest city.
	   Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the
northern city of Lille _ France's fourth-largest metropolis _ and
for a 10th day in the Alpine city of Chambery.
	   In the Normandy city of Caen, 400 bus drivers held a two-hour
strike Monday morning and afternoon due to an attack Friday. The
drivers' union leaders left open the possibility of restaging the
walkout Tuesday.
	   Union leaders demanded the immediate hiring of 15 more security
guards and the installation of TV cameras on buses.
	   Transit workers have demanded that the government put more
police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the
violence. Drivers, ticket agents and passengers have been beaten
and robbed, and trains and buses have been stoned, firebombed or
even fired upon.
	   The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from
working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit
unemployment rate. While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the
rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods.

Uganda seeks leaders' views on proposed amnesty law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Authorities Monday began seeking local
leaders' views on a proposed law that would grant amnesty to rebels
in the East African nation who lay down their arms.
	   A team headed by State Minister for Local Government Kahinda
Otafiire went to western districts of Bundibugyo, Kasese and Fort
Portal where rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces are active.
	   The rebels have bases on the slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains,
which stride the country's border with the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has admitted Ugandan
troops are inside eastern Congo to seek and destroy the rebels and
their bases.
	   The government recently appointed five Cabinet ministers to head
teams that will solicit views from local leaders in rebel infested
regions. Some of the views would then be incorporated in the new
legislation.
	   The government is also fighting rebels in northern and
northwestern Uganda, where teams are expected to seek opinion.
	   There is already in place a presidential pardon for rebels who
surrender, but parliament wants a comprehensive legislation.
	   Meanwhile, the government-controlled newspaper, New Vision,
reported that a 5-year-old and two soldiers were killed Friday when
the Lord's Resistance Army rebels ambushed a passenger truck.
	   The privately-owned Central Broadcasting Service radio said the
truck was apparently hit by a rocket-propelled grenade near Pawell
village, about 400 kilometers (248 miles) northwest of Kampala.

Serb troop movements as NATO measures compliance with peace deal0

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo's roads Monday as the government tried to convince NATO
it is meeting the deadline for complying with the peace deal to
avoid airstrikes.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors were hearing a briefing
Monday from the alliance's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark, on
his weekend talks in Belgrade, where he pressed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo.
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
during the weekend meeting, Milosevic agreed ``in very detailed
terms'' to withdrawing his forces by Tuesday's deadline.
	   As the deadline approached, the government's Serb Media Center
said three military units were returning to their barracks Monday
in the towns of Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   Later, a convoy of more than two dozen green Yugoslav tanks,
other armored vehicles and trucks was seen rolling through the
Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the Komorane checkpoint, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina,
but the policemen manning the small house at the intersection
remained on duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic at the intersection.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
who fled the fighting can return to their homes safely.
	   In Luxembourg, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said
that if the Serb withdrawals are followed through, ``that will
certainly be a significant advance, but we want to see the evidence
first.''
	   ``The planes are still on the runway. If Milosevic does not want
them to take off then it is up to him to comply, he knows what he
has got to do,'' Cook said.
	   In Brussels, the NATO official said intelligence reports confirm
``some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal.
	   He said NATO remained resolved to use military force once a
deadline on withdrawal runs out at 8 p.m. (1900GMT) Tuesday. ``He
has to get his skates on for the next 24 hours,'' the official
said.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying the with
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim Serb-led forces
withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return after they
leave to harass civilians.
	   On Sunday, mourners ran away or dived for cover when gunfire
whistled overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence wouldn't protect
the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind the mountain village Krajkova,
30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina.
	   His father, Rashit Elshani, blamed Serb police, saying his son
died simply because he's Albanian. Police have been shooting in the
area every night to try to scare off villagers, he said. Serb
officials were unavailable for comment.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about 1,000 meters (yards) away, the same
area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several times after
the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''

Spain says Basque election results favor peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with government reaction,
comments from interior minister, others. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Basque regional elections, the first since
armed separatists declared a cease-fire five weeks ago, opened the
door wider to peace, the Spanish government said Monday.
	   Basques crowded the polls in record numbers Sunday, favoring
more extreme versions of the region's traditional split between
those who seek independence and those who oppose it.
	   But Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told national Spanish
radio that the result was ``the best possible for peace,'' because
the Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was now an
undisputed major force within the regional Basque Parliament.
	   Mayor Oreja said that with the rise of the Popular Party, the
Basque parliament could not disregard that ``plurality is the
essence of the Basque Country.''
	   The government has not indicated what Aznar's next step will be.
He had taken a tough stance since the armed separatist group ETA
declared a cease-fire, insisting that the group accept the election
results and give up its arms for talks to go forward.
	   ETA supporters have urged the government, as a gesture of
goodwill, to transfer separatist prisoners scattered around the
country to institutions in the Basque country.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, politically allied with the ETA commandos,
said the election favored independence. The party is a new name for
the traditional Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The party spokesman, Arnaldo Otegi, told the Barcelona daily La
Vanguardia that the strong support for Basque nationalist parties
was a vote for ``peace, liberty and self-determination,''
	   Otegi said his party would not join any coalition government,
but would be an active participant in Parliament, La Vanguardia
reported Monday.
	   Although the lineup in the 75-seat Parliament between
pro-independence and anti-independence seats basically stayed the
same, there were important changes in the makeup on each side of
the aisle.
	   The voters, more than 70 percent of those registered turned out,
cast ballots giving three separatist parties a total of 41 seats
and four parties opposed to breaking up Spanish union, 35 seats,
similar to the existing lineup.
	   The separatist Basque Nationalist Party dropped a seat, but won
21, enough to give it the right to form the government.
	   Juan Jose Ibarretxe, Nationalist Party leader charged with
seeking a coalition government, said Monday, ``Let's see what we
can do in this country without excluding anybody.''
	   But the political map's variations are what encouraged Mayor
Oreja and others to see the elections as the curtain raiser to a
more vigorous peace process.
	   The big winners were Aznar's Popular Party and the Euskal
Herritarrok (Herri Batasuna) political coalition linked to the ETA.
	   Aznar's Popular Party jumped from 11 to 16 seats to become the
second most popular party in the regional Parliament.
	   The party is strongly identified with the Spanish government's
tough anti-terrorist policies and totally opposed to making
concessions to ETA or changing the constitution to allow Basque
secession.
	   The Socialist Party, the main opposition to Aznar's government
in the national parliament but on the same side of the fence in the
Basque country, gained two seats to total 14, although it fell from
second to fourth place in the voting.
	   Euskal Herritarrok gained two seats to 14, becoming the third
largest electoral force.
	   ETA _ the letters stand in the Basque language for Basque
Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since 1968, but
declared an open-ended cease-fire on Sept. 18 amid mounting
pressure for a negotiated end to one of Western Europe's last armed
conflicts.

Philippine central bank approves additional banking reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank on Monday
approved two additional measures aimed at strengthening the banking
sector.
	   The banking reforms still must be submitted to Congress for
approval, however.
	   The first gives banks a maximum of 60 days upon declaration of a
bank holiday to re-open. Bank holidays are granted to banks
experiencing severe financial difficulties or excessive
withdrawals.
	   The second gives banks the leeway to go below the required 10
percent statutory reserve requirement for a maximum of 90 days.
	   In both cases, any bank that fails to comply with the
requirement within the specified time frame will be subject to
receivership proceedings with the Philippine Deposit Insurance
System, which insures deposits in banks.
	   More than 20 mostly thrift and savings banks have been placed
under receivership by the central bank this year, largely due to
capital constraints and mismanagement.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities on Monday requested the
arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being held
in Britain on an arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move follows a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double
nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires and it is suspected
that he was kidnapped by the Chilean secret police.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said in a
statement.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities in
Bern, who must now decide whether to pass it on to British
authorities.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
his arrest earlier this month. The arrest came at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including Spaniards, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared. Jaccard's was one of the names on the list.
	   ``The Geneva authorities wish to clarify that their procedure
should not in any way prejudice those already undertaken by the
Spanish authorities, which should remain the priority,'' Bertossa
said.

Man believed to be Israeli thrown out of speeding car in Hebron

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A man believed to be an Israeli was
shot in the neck and his body dumped from a moving car in downtown
Hebron on Monday, paramedics and Palestinian reporters said.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by Palestinian militants hoping to wreck Mideast
peacemaking. The last such killing was in August when a member of
the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks by Islamic militants,
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and about 400 meters (yards) from the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   A group of Palestinian journalists was walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive
by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped on the
pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away. Journalists said they immediately notified
Israeli and Palestinian police forces.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot in the neck.

New Philippine health chief: government still can't halt spread of
</HEADLINE>
AIDS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' new health chief
said Monday that 31 new cases of HIV infections have been reported
in the past three months, indicating that the government has not
halted the spread of the AIDS-causing virus.
	   Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez Jr. said there are now a
total of 1,130 reported infections nationwide, 352 of which have
developed into full-blown AIDS cases.
	   Despite the relatively low level of AIDS in the country,
Romualdez said the government's anti-AIDS program has not been able
to stop or significantly reduce the number of infections.
	   When ``we get this pattern really down, then that is the time
that I can say the program has been successful,'' he told
reporters.
	   Romualdez said 18 of the new cases reported between July and
September were males. Most were infected through sexual
intercourse, but a 5-year-old girl was infected by her mother while
still a baby.
	   The health department estimates that about 33,000 people in the
country are afflicted with the disease without knowing it. A total
of 184 people are known to have died in the Philippines because of
AIDS, health officials said.

U.S. optimistic that gap with EU on data privacy can be bridged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United States is optimistic it can
settle its differences with the European Union over how to protect
private data about citizens, a U.S. diplomat said Monday.
	   An EU law came into effect Sunday to protect data privacy. The
law has already been written into the statute books of Greece and
Portugal, and is also being implemented in Britain, Sweden and
Italy along with additional rules.
	   The U.S. approach to data protection is much more ``hands off''
than the European version, with industry bodies providing ground
rules for the buying and selling of personal data.
	   ``The U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' the
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that
the difference could turn into a trade dispute if the 15-nation EU
started blocking data flows.
	   However, talks will continue on the issue. ``We expect to
continue our dialogue with the EU and we are optimistic we will
reach a mutually acceptable solution,'' the diplomat said.
	   Personal data including addresses, ages, buying habits, and
income brackets are bought and sold by list brokers in the EU as
well as in the United States. Brokers sell lists on to companies
that are looking for specific demographic groups for their
products.

Australian scientists identify fish virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Marine scientists said Monday they
had identified a herpes-type virus responsible for the deaths of
thousands of pilchards along the South Australian coast.
	   State Fisheries director Gary Morgan said the discovery, which
confirms for the first time that a virus is responsible for the
deaths, may allow scientists to predict future pilchard kills
around the world.
	   Marine scientists and veterinary pathologists from across
Australia held a telephone hookup to discuss how to capitalize on
the virus identification, made at the Australian Animal Health
Laboratories in Geelong at the weekend.
	   Morgan said the scientists wanted to develop a DNA probe that
would enable them to check whether the virus was dormant in healthy
fish, or whether imported pilchards or ballast water from foreign
ships carried the virus.
	   ``Everywhere else that pilchards are farmed we see these same
types of mass fatalities,'' Morgan said.
	   ``Up to now it's been almost recognized as an act of God. But I
would suggest the finger of suspicion would be pointed very
strongly at the virus now.
	   ``This is a real feather in the cap of Australian marine
science. If indeed other fish kills around the world can now be
traced back to the same type of virus or similar virus, it gives us
an explanation of why these things happen.''
	   The virus is the same one detected in dead pilchards in 1995,
when tens of thousands of metric tons of pilchards died in waters
stretching along Australia's southern and eastern coasts and to New
Zealand.
	   But Morgan said the virus was found only at the end of the 1995
kill and was not properly isolated.
	   The latest kill began about two weeks ago.

Report: Dutch striker ready to return to Nottingham Forest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from club. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Pierre van Hooijdonk, the Dutch
striker who has refused to play for Nottingham Forest this season
because of a contract dispute, is about to return to the club, the
club confirmed Monday.
	   Van Hooijdonk reached an agreement with the club last week and
straightened out the last details in a telephone conversation
Sunday night with Forest manager Dave Basset, the Algemeen Dagblad
reported.
	   ``I'm going to do my very best for the club,'' Van Hooijdonk
told the Algemeen Dagblad. ``The club needs me _ it's second from
bottom in the league.''
	   Van Hooijdonk, whose goals last season helped lead Forest win
promotion back to the Premier Division, was refused a summer
transfer by the club and has refused to play ever since.
	   He is currently keeping in shape by training with his old Dutch
club NAC Breda.
	   ``I want to show that I haven't lost any of my quality,'' he
said.
	   Forest said Van Hooijdonk plans to return to the City Ground on
Thursday _ against Bassett's wishes.
	   ``In an ideal world, Dave Bassett would not have him back but it
was a corporate decision. He represents an investment of 5 million
pounds (dlrs 8.4 million) and Dave Bassett accepts that,'' a club
statement said.
	   ``If Pierre Van Hooijdonk comes back and behaves himself, Dave
Bassett says he will take it from there.
	   ``Pierre Van Hooijdonk's suspension will finish on Thursday. ...
If he comes in for training on Friday he will be put into an
intensive program and his fitness will be assessed.''
	   Without the tall striker, Forest has made a disastrous start to
the season. It stands 19th in the 20-team Premiership and has
scored just seven goals in 10 matches.

Yeltsin cancels one-day trip to Austria

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of Yeltsin's illness. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors ordered President Boris Yeltsin to cancel
a trip to Austria because of extreme fatigue and recommended he
take a vacation, the Interfax news agency said Monday. The
announcement, two weeks after Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central
Asia, raises new questions about his ability to stay in office.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip to Vienna for
talks with the European Union on Tuesday instead, Interfax said,
quoting presidential press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was suffering from an ``asthenic
condition,'' that made him very weak and tired, both physically and
emotionally. Asthenia refers to a lack of bodily strength.
Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable, Yakushkin said.
	   The Kremlin refused to confirm the reports to The Associated
Press.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has crippling
health problems.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. Doctors said last
week he had recovered, but Yeltsin has still not returned to work
at the Kremlin full time. The trip to Vienna had been reduced to
one day from the originally scheduled two days.
	   Yakushkin said a committee of doctors, that usually meets before
Yeltsin travels, recommended he cancel his visit to Austria. It
said Yeltsin had not followed doctors' advice to stay home and
recuperate from the respiratory infection that curtailed his
Central Asian trip.
	   This, coupled with work pressures, caused him to become
extremely tired, he said.
	   Yakushkin said earlier Monday that the Russian leader was
working at a country residence outside of Moscow and was preparing
for the trip to Austria.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin was quoted as telling an Austrian newspaper that he was
``absolutely convinced'' that Russia would overcome its problems.
	   ``We will move neither from the reforms which are directed
toward the building of socially oriented market economy, nor from
further democratization of society,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Neue Kronen Zeitung newspaper.
	   Yeltsin's itinerary also called for him to meet with
International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss
economic assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after the Russian economic crisis
erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any more
payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping with
the crisis.
	   Other Russian officials, who will now accompany Primakov, were
expected to sign a number of economic agreements that should bring
dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodka.

August retail sales plunge 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Retail sales in Hong Kong fell by 20 percent in
August from the same month last year, marking the 10th consecutive
monthly decline, the government announced Monday.
	   Lower incomes and more unemployment _ now at a 15-year high _
pushed consumer spending sharply lower, Hong Kong's Census and
Statistics Department said. Retailers have been laying off staff
and slashing wages just to survive as the territory struggles
through hard times brought on by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Retail sales fell to an estimated 16.5 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 2.11 billion) in August, compared with 20.6 billion
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.64 billion) a year earlier.
	   The volume of goods sold also fell by 20 percent compared with
August 1997.
	   The sales volume of motor vehicles posted the biggest fall,
losing 49 percent in value and 45 percent in volume year-on-year,
followed by sales of clothing and footwear, which fell 35 percent
in value and 36 percent in volume.
	   For the first eight months of 1998, retail sales declined by 15
percent in value and 16 percent in volume. Hong Kong's economy
contracted 5 percent in the second quarter and is expected to
shrink by 4 percent for this year, compared with 5.3 percent growth
in 1997.

Opel names new chairman amid signs of tension with GM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., Adam Opel AG, named a new chairman of its supervisory
board Monday following the surprise resignation of its long-time
chief.
	   Hans Wilhelm Gaeb resigned from his post Friday after almost 18
years in office in what was seen as a sign of worsening relations
between Opel and its U.S. parent.
	   GM is seeking to merge its two big, independent automotive units
for North America and the rest of the world into one to respond
better to markets worldwide. The new boss is an American, G.
Richard Wagoner Jr.
	   At an extraordinary supervisory board meeting Monday, Opel
tapped Hans Barth, vice president in charge of project and
production support for GM Europe, to take over as chairman,
effective immediately.
	   In a statement, Opel said Michael Burns, head of GM's European
Operations in Zurich, Switzerland, is also to join its supervisory
board.
	   Media reports over the weekend said Gary Cowger, the incumbent
chairman of the management board, has been recalled to Detroit
after just four months at the head of the German subsidiary.
	   Opel has not confirmed those reports, but planned a news
conference for later Monday.

700 employees of closed Thai bank call for government help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 700 employees of a bank being
closed by the government demonstrated Monday to demand that the
finance minister find a way to save their jobs.
	   An estimated 5,000 people will lose their jobs when the Bangkok
Bank of Commerce completely ceases operations by the end of next
year. It has already been suspended from most banking activities as
part of a sweeping restructuring of the debt-laden banking system
announced by the government in August. A government bank will take
over its assets.
	   The bank was at the center of the country's biggest financial
scandal in 1996, when its directors revealed that the bank had bad
debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the time).
	   Investigations showed that the bank made many unsecured loans to
insiders, led by senior bank officers.
	   The case highlighted inadequate lending practices and
supervision, which helped lead to a crash of almost the entire
financial sector last year.
	   Monday's demonstrators demanded that the government find them
jobs or keep them on the payroll for another year once they become
unemployed starting Dec. 1.
	   Employees of the bank from nearby provinces joined in on the
demonstration.
	   They threatened to reveal the names of politicians, including
some in the government, who they claimed borrowed excessively from
the bank with collateral much below the legal requirement.
	   The group also threatened to gather 50,000 signatures from
eligible voters for a petition to oust Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda. Thailand's new constitution allows voters to
present such petitions to the president of Parliament to try to get
rid of officials they consider corrupt or incompetent.
	   Tarrin met with seven representatives of the demonstrators
Monday evening, but details of their talk were not available.
	   Meanwhile, the newly created state-owned Radhanasin Bank took
over the existing 58 branches of troubled Laem Thong Bank.
	   The state bank said in a news release that as of Monday, all
Laem Thong Bank branches had officially changed their name to
Radhanasin Bank.
	   The takeover is part of the comprehensive plan announced in
August to salvage the banking sector.
	   Radhanasin was created earlier this year to take over the good
assets of 56 finance companies that were forced to closed after
going into virtual bankruptcy.

Ovett, Hemery among candidates for president of UK Athletics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Olympic champions and world
record-holders Steve Ovett and David Hemery are among the
candidates for president of UK Athletics, the governing body of
British track and field.
	   Ovett won the gold medal in the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics and is a former record-holder at 1,500 meters, one mile
and two miles. He has been working as a TV commentator.
	   Hemery was the 400-meter hurdles champion at the 1968 Mexico
City Olympics and held the world record in the event. He has since
been a coach, teacher, manager and writer.
	   The three other candidates for the post are Sir Eddie
Kulukundis, who has given financial assistance to athletes since
the early 1970s; former triple jumper and coach Tom McNab, and
former runner and British team manager Mike Turner.
	   All British athletics clubs are eligible to vote, with the
results scheduled to be announced on Nov. 17.
	   UK Athletics took over the running of the sport in Britain after
the financial collapse of the British Athletic Federation. Former
5,000-meter world record-holder David Moorcroft has run the
organization since last year.

Coconut oil prices given a lift by Typhoon Babs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Reports of damage by Typhoon Babs in
the Philippines' coconut-producing region of Bicol have given
global coconut oil trading a boost.
	   Commodity traders reported that European buyers, who have been
slow to purchase during the past several months, returned to the
market for more coconut oil last week, helping to push prices
higher.
	   One trader said coconut oil's spot price was pegged Monday at
dlrs 735 a ton for November-December delivery. This compares with
dlrs 670 per ton two weeks ago.
	   Traders said the market sentiment was speculative, with European
oleochemical companies and dealers stocking up on more coconut oil.
	   With the Philippines still the world's leading supplier of
coconut oil, the typhoon in some of its main coconut-producing
provinces has raised concern among heavy coconut oil users, such as
oleochemical companies and food manufacturers.
	   A trader noted that damage from Typhoon Babs will most likely
affect next year's copra production, since it hit coconut trees
that were still in the flower-bearing stage.
	   Copra is the dried white flesh from a coconut.
	   Another trader said the copra harvest will not be too bad since
Babs only affected the Bicol region.
	   Although Bicol is a major coconut-producing region, other
regions such as southern Mindanao, southern Tagalog and western
Mindanao have bigger coconut harvests. The three regions alone
account for almost 50 percent of total copra production.

Man believed to be Israeli thrown out of speeding car in Hebron

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A man believed to be an Israeli was
shot in the neck and his body dumped from a moving car Monday in
downtown Hebron, paramedics and Palestinian reporters said.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by Palestinian militants hoping to wreck Mideast
peacemaking. The last such killing was in August when a member of
the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks by Islamic militants,
especially since last week's peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians in Washington.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and about 400 meters (yards) from the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   A group of Palestinian journalists was walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive
by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped on the
pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away. Journalists said they immediately notified
Israeli and Palestinian police forces.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot in the neck.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his body thrown from a moving car in downtown Hebron
Monday in what appeared to be an attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The
last such killing was in August when a member of the Islamic
militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive
by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped on the

Palestinian police forces.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot in the neck.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at an electricity station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants had used the victim's
car to escape and requested that Palestinian police help in finding
the vehicle.

Lebanon says peace deal `disappointing,' attacks Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon criticized Monday the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement as ``a big disappointment'' and
accused Palestinians of abandoning Arabs who have supported them.
	   ``The agreement was a big disappointment compared with Arab
aspirations,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said of the deal
reached Friday. ``The Palestinian side is paying a very high
price.''
	   Criticism of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is common since
Lebanon's own talks with the Jewish state have been deadlocked for
more than two years. Negotiations between Israel and Syria, the
dominant power in Lebanon, also have gone nowhere since 1996.
	   Both Lebanon and Syria say they will negotiate simultaneously
and are demanding an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and
from Syria's Golan Heights.
	   President Elias Hrawi, in a speech opening a conference of Arab
engineers Monday, lashed out at the Palestinians for going it alone
and giving up on territory Israel occupies in Lebanon and Syria.
	   ``All the Arabs have carried the burden of their cause for 50
years. They made Lebanon carry the burden of their ambitions and
maneuvering. ... They've undermined the (Arab) confrontation front
and support and destroyed our state,'' Hrawi said.
	   Many Lebanese blame Palestinian guerrillas, who ran a
state-within-a-state in Lebanon in the 1970s, for contributing to
the devastating 1975-90 civil war. Many Palestinians, in turn, feel
Arab states have cynically used their cause.

NATO discusses weekend deal that could stave off airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO has given Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic 24 hours to reduce his forces in Kosovo to pre-crisis
levels or face airstrikes, officials said. Early Monday, the Serb
leader started moving in the right direction.
	   ``He knows the direction he has to move in if he wants to avert
airstrikes,'' said a NATO officials after the 16 ambassadors were
briefed on 16 hours of weekend talks between Milosevic and the two
top Alliance generals.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in Luxembourg said
that if Milosevic sticks to the deal ``that will certainly be a
significant advance, but we want to see the evidence first.''
	   Intelligence reports on Monday showed that ``there is some
indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal,'' said the
NATO official. He said NATO remained resolved to use military force
once a deadline on withdrawal runs out at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT)
Tuesday. ``He has to get his skates on for the next 24 hours,'' the
officials said.
	   Milosevic ``agreed in very detailed terms to the withdrawals''
during talks with NATO Generals Wesley Clark of the United States
and German General Klaus Naumann. The generals were in Belgrade
over the weekend to reinforce a strong letter from NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, stressing the Alliance would not
hesitate to use military action if necessary.
	   ``The planes are still on the runway. If Milosevic does not want
them to take off then it is up to him to comply, he knows what he
has got to do,'' said Cook ahead of a meeting of EU Foreign
Ministers.
	   NATO will assess the level of withdrawal Tuesday afternoon
before a NATO Council will meet just hours before the deadline
expires.

Pakistan draw Test, Australia clinch series 1-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with rest of Pakistani batting. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Ijaz Ahmed's hard fought century and a
gritty 75 from Moin Khan enabled to Pakistan draw the third and
decisive cricket Test against Australia, but the tourists won the
first series on Pakistan soil after 39 years Monday.
	   Before skipper Mark Taylor's 1-0 series victory Monday, only
Richie Benaud had succeeded in beating Pakistan in Pakistan in the
1959-60 season when Australia recorded a 2-0 win in a three-match
series.
	   Pakistan, needing a huge 419 on the last day to square the
three-match series, was 78 for four before lunch and the Aussies
were right on top for their second victory in the three-match.
	   But Ahmed played a superb match-saving knock, scoring an
unbeaten 120 off 230 balls in 327 minutes, hitting 16 fours as
Pakistan finished at 262 for five with Inzamam not out on 21.
	   ``I delivered for the team when it neededed the most,'' Ahmed
said after being adjudged man of the series for Pakistan. He hit
two successive centuries in the second and third Tests.
	   ``It's great feeling to beat Pakistan after long time,'' said
Mark Taylor, who won the man of the series award for Australia.
	   Ahmed and Khan both played resolutely and kept Pakistan's
unbeaten record of 33 matches intact at the National Stadium. They
have won 16 matches here while the remaining 17 were drawn.
	   Ahmed, who scored his career-best 155 against Australia in the
drawn second Test at Peshawar, and Khan, stuck in the middle and
waited for loose deliveries on a slow track.
	   `Crisis Man' Khan gave fine support to Ahmed, who brought up his
fifth Test hundred against the Aussies by lifting off-spinner Gavin
Robertson for his 14th boundary of the innings.
	   Khan was caught in the deep by Stuart MacGill off part-time
spinner Darren Lehmann with only 12 overs remaining in the day. He
made a match-saving 153 for the fifth wicket with Ahmed in 186
minutes and hammered 10 fours in his 75-run knock.
	   Both batsmen had their share of luck with Ahmed being dropped by
skipper Mark Taylor on 2. Australia was still in with a chance
before tea but Mark Waugh could not hold onto a sharp chance off
Khan at second slip with Pakistan at 140 for four.
	   Earlier, Colin Miller grabbed three wickets in just 22 balls
before lunch which ensured either a draw or an Australian victory.
	   It would have been five down for Pakistan had Taylor not spilled
an edge off Ahmed in the first slip off paceman Glenn McGrath when
the batsman had scored just two.
	   Pakistan started off briskly with skipper Aamir Sohail hammering
McGrath for three successive boundaries and the total racing to 20
by the end of third over.
	   However, 34-year-old Miller broke the momentum when debutant
Shahid Afridi departed after six runs. Then 18-year-old Afridi
tried to drive the medium paceman and got a thin edge to
wicketkeeper Ian Healy.
	   Miller further reduced Pakistan to 35 for three when he had
Sohail and veteran Salim Malik trapped leg before wicket. Malik
made a pair in the match after he was out for ducks in both
innings.
	   Yousaf Youhanna also struggled as McGrath passed the outside
edge of the right-hander's bat on a number of occasions. He scored
his first run after 52 minutes and 39 balls.
	   Just before lunch, leg-spinner Stuart MacGill struck and
Youhanna (11) was caught by Mark Waugh at silly mid off.

Police disperse jobless college grads outside Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, 68 reported arrested including youth
leader

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Riot police charged hundreds of unemployed
college graduates who defied a protest ban and gathered outside
Parliament Monday to press their demand for jobs.
	   About 300 protesters were outside Parliament when police charged
into the crowd to disperse it. Official sources said six people
were injured and a dozen arrested, though a youth leader claimed
dozens were hurt and more than 60 people were rounded up.
	   The demonstrators went on to the regional government prefecture,
then to the local Moroccan Labor Union headquarters, where hundreds
gathered inside despite efforts by police to block them.
	   Nearly 1,000 of police were deployed in central Rabat to prevent
further unrest. During the Parliament protest, police roughed up
journalists for several foreign and domestic media and seized their
film.
	   The youth leader, Ahmed Kabil, assistant secretary-general of
the Association of Young Unemployed Graduates, said police arrested
the group's leader, Faber Bensaid, outside the local government
prefecture.
	   Police had banned a march planned by the group, so leaders
instead ``wanted to turn it into a sit-in in front of the
Parliament,'' Kabil said.
	   Moroccan students and graduates have periodically staged
protests demanding more aid for training and job placement.

Dutch cycling union chairman calls for release of TVM team leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The chairman of the Royal Dutch
Cycling Union called on French authorities Monday to allow a
cycling team leader arrested during this summer's Tour de France to
return home.
	   Cees Priem has not been allowed to leave France since July 23
when he and TVM team doctor Andrei Mikhailov were arrested
following the discovery of drugs in the team's hotel.
	   TVM cyclists were taken to a hospital in Albertville for
extensive medical checks and later dropped out of the Tour, saying
they did not have the physical or mental strength to finish the
race.
	   Royal Dutch Cycling Union President Joop Atsma said in an
interview published in Monday's De Telegraaf newspaper that Priem
has been held too long.
	   ``We've waited long enough,'' he said. ``Our patience with the
French is running out. It is time for the foreign minister to tell
our ambassador in Paris to express our displeasure.''
	   An investigating judge was to review the case Tuesday and could
order the release of Priem, who has been placed under formal
investigation, a step short of being formally charged.
	   Although Priem was freed from jail in August, he was not allowed
to leave France and must report to police daily.
	   Atsma, a Christian Democrat member of the Dutch parliament, said
there is support across parliament for action to relieve ``Priem's
hopeless-looking situation.''
	   Atsma even suggested that French authorities were holding Priem
to protest the Dutch government's liberal drug policy, which often
has led to diplomatic rows between the two nations.
	   The investigation of the TVM team actually began in March, when
French customs agents found about 100 doses of EPO, which increases
oxygen to the red blood cells, in a team car.
	   But that find only came to light following the outbreak of the
scandal involving the Festina team which was kicked off the Tour
after some of its riders admitted taking performance-enhancing
drugs.

Official: Vatican wants to attend final status talks on Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - With Mideast peace talks back on track, the
Vatican's foreign minister said Monday the Holy See wants to join
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the future of
Jerusalem and its holy sites.
	   Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran said that Israel and the
Palestinians would only benefit from bringing all those with a
stake in the holy city into the talks.
	   ``The (Israeli and Palestinian) negotiators are expected to
include the participation of the sponsors of the peace process and
other parties could also be invited to contribute,'' Tauran said.
	   His speech opened a two-day conference on Jerusalem attended by
some 40 Catholic clergymen from all over the world.
	   Tauran's comments came just three days after Israel and the
Palestinians cleared a major hurdle on the way to final status
talks by concluding an interim agreement on a West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   Under the original timetable, the talks were to be completed by
May 4, 1999. However, negotiations have not yet begin, and the
deadline no longer seems realistic.
	   In negotiations on a permanent peace agreement, the two sides
will try to tackle the most difficult issues, including the future
of Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the
capital of their would-be state. But Israel, which captured the
Arab sector in the 1967 Middle East war, has maintained it will not
accept a divided capital.
	   Tauran cautioned that any deal must ensure that Jerusalem's
religious and cultural heritage is not changed. The Vatican sees
Jerusalem as ``the symbol and the national center of both the
peoples that claim it as their capital,'' Tauran said.
	   Disputes over the status of Jerusalem soured relations between
Israel and the Vatican for many years, but the two established
diplomatic relations in 1993, the year Israel signed its
breakthrough peace agreement with the Palestinians.

Havel wants materials on Zilk to be declassified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel asked
authorities to declassify documents relating to allegations that
former Vienna mayor Helmut Zilk was an agent of the former
communist secret police, the news agency CTK reported Monday.
	   CTK quoted Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek as saying that
Havel sent the request after Sen. Vaclav Benda, once director of an
institute investigating crimes of the former communist regime, said
there was evidence that Zilk worked for the Czechoslovak secret
police, or STB.
	   Zilk was to receive a high state order Wednesday in a ceremony
marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak
Republic in 1918.
	   Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk spied
for the Czech communist secret service and provided information
that led to several convictions.
	   Zilk said he considers the accusation a nonsense, adding he had
``nothing to do with the secret police in Czechoslovakia.''
	   He also said he would demand that Havel provide ``all materials
and evidence.''
	   Despite the president's claim that he would not provide any
information not even to Zilk, his chancellor Ivan Medek sent a
letter to Benda Monday, asking for his opinion on ``the case Helmut
Zilk.''
	   In his reply sent to the presidential office the same day, Benda
said he considers the affair ``very unfortunate and damaging to
Czech-Austrian relations.''
	   He, however, confirmed that Zilk acted as a paid agent of the
Czechoslovak intelligence service in the second half of the 1960s.
Benda said his statement was based on ``confirmed information.''
	   Both letters were made available to The Associated Press by
Havel's office. Benda could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   On Sunday, many Czech politicians voiced their disapproval to
Havel's decision.
	   ``If I want to award somebody a state order and then put him in
such an unpleasant, embarrassing situation, that's something that
mustn't happen,'' parliamentary speaker Vaclav Klaus told Czech
radio.
	   ``The president should have know that before,'' minister
jaroslav basta said.
	   Eighty-one state orders and medals will be awarded by Havel on
Wednesday, 24 of them posthumously.

Report: Dutch striker ready to return to Nottingham Forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Pierre van Hooijdonk, the Dutch
striker who has refused to play for Nottingham Forest this season
because of a contract dispute, is about to return to the club, the
club confirmed Monday.
	   Van Hooijdonk reached an agreement with the club last week and
straightened out the last details in a telephone conversation
Sunday night with Forest manager Dave Basset, the Algemeen Dagblad
reported.
	   ``I'm going to do my very best for the club,'' Van Hooijdonk
told the Algemeen Dagblad. ``The club needs me _ It's second from
bottom in the league.''
	   Van Hooijdonk, whose goals last season helped lead Forest win
promotion back to the Premier Division, was refused a summer
transfer by the club and has refused to play ever since.
	   He is currently keeping in shape by training with his old Dutch
club NAC Breda.
	   ``I want to show that I haven't lost any of my quality,'' he
said.
	   Forest said Van Hooijdonk plans to return to the City Ground on
Thursday _ against Bassett's wishes.
	   ``In an ideal world, Dave Bassett would not have him back but it
was a corporate decision. He represents an investment of 5 million
pounds (dlrs 8.4 million) and Dave Bassett accepts that,'' a club
statement said.
	   ``If Pierre Van Hooijdonk comes back and behaves himself, Dave
Bassett says he will take it from there.
	   ``Pierre Van Hooijdonk's suspension will finish on Thursday. ...
If he comes in for training on Friday he will be put into an
intensive program and his fitness will be assessed.''
	   Without the tall striker, Forest has made a disastrous start to
the season. It stands 19th in the 20-team Premiership and has
scored just seven goals in 10 matches.

Congo peace talks open amid passion and acrimony
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MILDRED MULENGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba made an
impassioned plea for peace in the embattled Congo on Monday as he
opened an acrimonious meeting of African defense and foreign
ministers aimed at ending the war.
	   ``You stand at the cutting edge, a defining moment ... to
determine whether Africa has got the political will and
determination to end the war in the Congo,'' Chiluba said.
	   Rebels fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila
were present, but Congolese officials planned to snub them. Kabila
insists the rebels are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda who allegedly
are backing them with invading forces.
	   ``To ask us to talk to those people would be very dangerous
because the real rebels are Rwanda and Uganda,'' he told reporters.
	   Rwanda has denied it has troops in Congo.
	   Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge accused Rwandan Foreign
Minister Anastase Gasana of lying and described him as ``a rude,
naughty little boy who needs his ears pinched.''
	   Uganda says it has dispatched troops to Congo to strike at
Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Chiluba tasked the ministers from 12 mostly southern African
nations, along with observers from Libya, with finding ``a quiet,
reasoned settlement of pertinent issues'' obstructing an end to the
Congo war.
	   Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity, said that if the talks fail, it
would be ``another collective indictment of all of us as
Africans.''
	   Previous talks aimed at ending the fighting which erupted in
August ended in failure.
	   Salim said the meeting will seek an immediate cessation of
hostilities, a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign troops
from Congo and try to address security concerns of Congo's
neighbors.
	   Rwanda and Uganda faced off at the talks against Kabila and his
southern African military allies _ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
	   Also present were South Africa _ which has launched its own
peace initiative by holding talks with Rwanda, Uganda and the
rebels _ and Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania which have refused to
support military intervention.
	   Gabon represented French-speaking central and west Africa, with
Zambia the neutral chair.
	   Last week, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia announced an offensive
against rebel strongholds in the dense jungles of eastern Congo.
Zimbabwe dispatched more than 2,000 extra troops to support 3,000
already fighting with Kabila's forces.
	   Namibia now has between 600 to 1,000 troops in Congo, according
to past media reports. Angola has about 1,000 troops. The number of
troops to be added in the new offensive was not known.
	   Previously, Kabila's allies were concentrated in western Congo,
where they fended off a rebel onslaught on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   The Congolese rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of
corruption, mismanagement and promoting tribalism.

Malaysia to review Five-Power Defense Arrangement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia plans to review its
defense needs, including its stand toward a defense arrangement
with Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Britain, Defense
Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Monday.
	   Speaking with reporters after meeting New Zealand Foreign
Minister Don McKinnon, Syed Hamid said McKinnon had expressed his
country's concern over talk that Malaysia intended to pull out of
the Five-Power Defense Arrangement.
	   McKinnon said New Zealand felt that military links through the
arrangement should be continued into the next century because of
their usefulness in military exercises, training and education, the
Malaysian news agency Bernama reported.
	   The arrangement was created 27 years ago to defend Malaysia and
Singapore from a communist threat.
	   It needs to be reviewed to meet Malaysia's defense needs in the
new century, Bernama quoted Syed Hamid as saying.
	   He said Malaysia would make known its stand on the arrangement
after it had completed its defense policy review in the middle of
next year.
	   He also said he had discussed with McKinnon the possibility of
expanding the arrangement's membership to include a country that
shared a common history.

Four candidates to run in Kazakstan's presidential election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two more politicians have joined the race for
Kazakstan's presidential election in January, bringing the number
of candidates to four, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Communist leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin and a lawmaker in the
upper house of parliament, Engels Gabbasov, have registered at the
Central Electoral Commission, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing commission official Yelena Kuleshova. Gabbasov is running as
an independent.
	   The other two candidates in the Jan. 10 election in this former
Soviet republic in Central Asia are former Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin and autocratic President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who
remains a clear favorite.
	   Nazarbayev's government has been criticized by international
human rights groups for restricting Kazakstan's opposition and the
media.
	   In a separate development Monday, Nazarbayev appointed
Kazakstan's former ambassador to Turkey, Baltash Tursumbayev, as
deputy prime minister. The presidential press service would not say
what sectors Tursumbayev would be responsible for, according to
Interfax.

Yeltsin cancels one-day trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 9th graf with Yakushkin quote, no plans to
hospitalize Yeltsin. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors ordered President Boris Yeltsin to cancel
a trip to Austria because of extreme fatigue and recommended he
take a vacation, the Interfax news agency said Monday. The
announcement, two weeks after Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central
Asia, raises new questions about his ability to stay in office.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip to Vienna for
talks with the European Union on Tuesday instead, Interfax said,
quoting presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was suffering from an ``asthenic
condition,'' that made him very weak and tired, both physically and
emotionally. Asthenia refers to a lack of bodily strength.
Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable, Yakushkin said.
	   The Kremlin refused to confirm the reports to The Associated
Press.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and they deny that he has crippling
health problems.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. Doctors said last
week he had recovered, but Yeltsin has still not returned to work
at the Kremlin full time. The trip to Vienna had been reduced to
one day from the originally scheduled two days.
	   Yakushkin said a committee of doctors that usually meets before
Yeltsin travels recommended he cancel his visit to Austria. It said
Yeltsin had not followed doctors' advice to stay home and
recuperate from the respiratory infection that curtailed his
Central Asian trip.
	   This, coupled with work pressures, caused him to become
extremely tired, he said.
	   ``Doctors unanimously voted for cancelling the trip,'' Yakushkin
said. He said there were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin.
	   Yakushkin said earlier Monday that the Russian leader was
working at a country residence outside of Moscow and was preparing
for the trip to Austria.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin's itinerary also called for him to meet with
International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to discuss
economic assistance.
	   Russia has said it is counting on further disbursements of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package to pay its bills for the rest of
the year. The IMF froze the loan after Russia's latest economic
crisis erupted in mid-August, and has said it will not deliver any
more payments until it sees signs that Russia has a plan for coping
with its troubles.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will not undertake
any more foreign trips, but Interfax said Monday that a visit to
India in December is still on.
	   Yeltsin also plans several meetings in November with foreign
guests, including Japanese Prime Minister Keijo Obuchi, German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands, Interfax said,
quoting the deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodko.

Israeli guard slain, thrown from speeding car in Hebron

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli police saying victim was an Israeli
guard. Minor edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his dead body thrown from a moving car Monday in
Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the slaying.
	   Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's killing occurred shortly after 2 p.m. in the downtown
Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, an area that is under Israeli
control and about 400 yards (meters) from the Jewish settlement of
Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive
by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped on the
pavement, the reporters said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
his head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away. Journalists said they notified Israeli and
Palestinian police forces.
	   Palestinian paramedics tried to revive the victim and then
pronounced him dead. They said he had been shot in the neck.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at an electric station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants escaped in the victim's
car.

Sri Lanka restricts New Zealand to 188
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ New Zealand's batting lineup was
grounded by Sri Lanka in their Wills Cup quarterfinal clash Monday,
as the team was bowled out for 188 in the 50th over.
	   New Zealand, which pulled off a thrilling last-ball win against
Zimbabwe in its first game Saturday, wound up its innings in 49.5
overs in the face of tight Sri Lankan bowling and some superb
fielding. Three New Zealand batsmen were run out.
	   Sri Lanka pegged wickets at regular intervals, helped by some
reckless batting by New Zealand batsmen including openers Nathan
Astle and Matthew Bell. Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan took three
wickets for 31 runs in his 10 overs.
	   New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming was out leg before to
Chaminda Vaas on a low delivery that cut back. The captain's
promising-looking innings ended at 23 off 26 balls.
	   Adam Parore lent some respectability to his team's score with
his 13th half century. Parore scored 57 off 87 balls including
three fours.

Report: South African truth panel to condemn ANC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 3rd graf to UPDATE with Mandela given advance copy
of report; INSERTS 8th-10th and last grafs with comment from
justice minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid-era
abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights
violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state
broadcaster said Monday.
	   The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in
power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect
implication in right violations.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final
report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report was
expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white
governments and their brutal security services.
	   President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy on
Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with
the report.
	   South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a
``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and
morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and
after the fall of apartheid.
	   An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report
referred to a commission letter sent in advance ``informing us of
its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights
violations.''
	   Commission officials could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists in Pretoria he had
heard the news report, but would not comment.
	   Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court
to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him in
covering up state-sponsored terror.
	   ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar
said, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.
	   The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting
with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid
appearing embarrassed.
	   The party says the accusations against it likely would center on
the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military
camps in Angola and bombings.
	   Omar said he expected the report's conclusions to set off debate
but added it would ``lay the basis for reconciliation.''

Hakkinen confident of Grand Prix victory in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Going into the final race of the year with the
Formula One championship at stake, Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen
said he is surprised at how little stress he feels.
	   ``Sometimes the pressure can make you more nervous and tired,''
the series leader said Monday. ``But I don't have that. I feel
good. I believe it's because of the confidence I have in myself in
terms of driving and my confidence in the team.''
	   Hakkinen holds a four-point lead over Ferrari's Michael
Schumacher going into Sunday's season-ending Japanese Grand Prix.
All he needs to do is finish second to claim his first title and
give McLaren the drivers and constructors championships for the
first time since 1991.
	   ``To go into this final grand prix in a position where you can
actually finish second, it's a luxury, it's unbelievable,''
Hakkinen said at a news conference.
	   To stop him, Ferrari is counting on Schumacher finishing first
and anyone but Hakkinen finishing second.
	   Schumacher would clinch his third world title if he wins and
Hakkinen does not place better than third.
	   Schumacher can also win the series championship if he finishes
second at Suzuka and Hakkinen is out of the top six.
	   But Hakkinen said he's not thinking about such outcomes.
	   ``I don't think `what if something goes wrong?' I think that
everything should go right, and I feel good. I feel comfortable,''
he said.
	   And he's got good reason to be confident.
	   The Finn has won seven of 15 races this year in his silver
McLaren, including the Grand Prix of Luxembourg five weeks ago.
	   Since then, Hakkinen has tested in Barcelona, Spain;
Magny-Cours, France; and Silverstone, England. Much of the focus
has been on Bridgestone's selection of wet-weather tires.
	   Hakkinen has also had about seven days off, including a trip
back to Finland, he said.
	   No matter the outcome of Sunday's race, Hakkinen said it has
been an exciting year.
	   ``We are in the last Grand Prix where the decision is who is
going to be world champion. I think we can look back very
positively. This has been a great year.''

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador signed a historic peace
treaty Monday, ending a 57-year dispute over a slice of Amazon
jungle that brought them to war three times.
	   As dignitaries from three continents looked on, the foreign
ministers of the two South American nations signed the accord in
Brazil's capital, where most of the peace talks took place.
	   The treaty sets the boundary on a contested 48-mile (78 km)
section of their border in the Andean foothills. Both laid claim to
the jungle-cloaked area that was left undefined in the 1942 Rio de
Janeiro Protocol that set territorial limits.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
looked on from a dais, sitting on either side of Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   They were accompanied by Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile,
Carlos Menem of Argentina, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Andres
Pastrana of Colombia. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain
also attended, while the United States was represented by U.S.
envoy Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former aide to
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   ``It's been a good week for peace accords, with Ireland and
Israel and now this,'' said McLarty. ``Hopefully, Kosovo will move
forward in the near term.''

first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli guard was
shot in the neck and his body thrown from a moving car in an

Korean conglomerates face forced restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a victory for a determined
government, South Korea's top five conglomerates apparently are
finally facing up to the need to restructure their businesses
around a relatively few core sectors.
	   Under government pressure, the five heavily indebted
conglomerates, or chaebol, were required to submit their
restructuring plans to their creditor banks by the end of
September.
	   If they failed, the government threatened to have the banks,
most of which it controls, call in their loans and cut off their
lines of credit, an almost certain death sentence.
	   The chaebol got the message.
	   The question now becomes whether their plans are workable _
whether the chaebol can find anybody to buy the money-losing
affiliates they now seem willing to shed, whether their proposed
mergers will actually stem bloated production.
	   Creditor banks are reviewing the plans of the five conglomerates
_ Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK _ and will report to the
government in a few weeks.
	   The government will review those reports and give a yes or no to
the individual chaebol by mid-December. It is uncertain whether
those that fail to meet the government's criteria will be given
additional time to submit new plans.
	   The government wants the five chaebol to focus on core
businesses, including automaking, electronics, petrochemicals,
shipbuilding and banking and financial services, giving up
money-losing subsidiaries in everything from soft drinks to
amusement parks.
	   A restructuring of the bloated chaebol was a key promise South
Korea made to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a
dlrs 58 billion bailout of its economy last December.
	   The government originally gave the chaebol until July to come up
with their restructuring plans. They failed to meet that deadline.
Then the government threatened crippling penalties and set the new
deadline.
	   ``No one should doubt the government's will to restructure
chaebol fraught with problems,'' Kim Dong-su, a spokesman for the
Financial Supervisory Commission, said.
	   But he said the process will be complex and take time.
	   The Korea Exchange Bank, the main creditor of the nation's
largest conglomerate, Hyundai, said Monday its review was
proceeding ``smoothly.''
	   Other banks, including Choheung, Hanil and Korea First,
confirmed that they also were reviewing proposals from the other
four top conglomerates. All refused to disclose details.
	   But local media reported that Hyundai, which has already
liquidated four affiliates, plans to reduce the number of its
subsidiaries from 62 to 35 by the end of next year through mergers,
sell-offs and liquidation.
	   That will help Hyundai consolidate or restructure its business
around five core sectors, including automaking, construction and
engineering, electronics, chemicals, and financial services, they
said.
	   Other conglomerates also plan to overhaul operations around key
businesses, trimming 30 to 40 percent of their affiliates, the
media reports said.
	   The open government intervention provoked debate among financial
experts and academics.
	   ``Government intervention is unavoidable. It has become apparent
that chaebol can do nothing on their own,'' Lee Pil-sang, an
economics professor at Korea University, said.
	   He pointed out that all past governments had no will or reason
to tame the family-owned chaebol, which fueled South Korea's rapid
economic expansion in the 1970s and 80s and with which they
maintained cozy, corrupt relations.
	   Lee Han-ku, head of the private Daewoo Research Institute, was
critical of the government moves.
	   ``The forceful restructuring is unrealistic. Indebted companies
will have to be liquidated through sell-offs. Who will buy them?''
Lee said.
	   ``Chaebol know that they should slim down to survive. Even if it
takes time, they should be given time to restructure on their
own,'' he said.
	   The conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and
over-diversifying during the country's boom years on bad loans won
through collusion with government and bankers.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate is controlled by a single
family and has 40 to 60 cross-funded subsidiaries.
	   As of April 15, the number of affiliates among the nation's top
five chaebol totaled 257, including 62 for Hyundai, 61 for Samsung,
37 for Daewoo, 52 for LG and 45 for SK.
	   One government report shows that the 30 largest chaebol groups
account for one-third of South Korea's industrial output and lead
its export-driven economy.
	   About a dozen conglomerates collapsed under huge bank debts last
year, chasing away foreign investors and thus fueling a financial
crisis.

	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hardliners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down the prime minister.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by a special
majority of 60 of the 120 legislators. Supporters of the bill said
they were confident they could pass the legislation.

Thailand's main opposition party to woo overseas voters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The main opposition party will be
wooing Thai citizens living abroad to participate in the next
general election, its chief spokesman said Monday.
	   The head of the New Aspiration Party, former Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, will lead a delegation on a visit to the
United States Oct. 29-Nov. 5. Among the cities to be visited are
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
	   ``We are planning to convey our message to Thais living abroad
about the next general election, which will be in line with the new
constitution,'' said Suraporn Danaitangtrakool, spokesman for
Chavalit's party.
	   For the first time, the new charter allows Thais living abroad
to vote.
	   Other party missions will be sent to Australia, the Middle East,
Malaysia and Singapore, said Suraporn.
	   Chavalit stepped down from the premiership last November because
of popular discontent over his handling of the country's economic
crisis. He was succeeded by Chuan Leekpai of the Democrat Party.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities on Monday also requested
the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being
held in Britain on an arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move follows a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double
nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the Chilean secret police.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities,
who will decide whether to pass it on to British authorities.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
his arrest earlier this month. The arrest came at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule that ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including Spaniards, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared. Jaccard's was one of the names on the list.
	   Bertossa added that the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet
should be given priority.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Daily Star, Lebanon's only
English-language daily, and the International Herald Tribune are
joining forces to print and distribute their newspapers together in
Lebanon and the Middle East, an announcement said Monday.
	   Jamil Mroue, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Daily Star,
said the deal will provide readers with a ``unique information
package, combining local viewpoint and global outlook.''
	   ``It is the most exciting newspaper venture in the Arab world,''
he added in comments published in The Star.
	   The newspaper package will include the entire editions of the
International Herald Tribune and the Daily Star. The Star will
provide two sections, one covering Lebanese news and one
specialized in regional news, the announcement said.
	   The IHT will be printed in The Daily Star printing house in
Beirut, which will become the 16th of the IHT's printsite locations
spread across three continents, it said.
	   Mroue said they hoped to begin the project in March.
	   The IHT was founded in Paris in 1887 and has been jointly owned
since 1967 by The New York Times and The Washington Post.
	   The Daily Star was first published in 1952 by Mroue's father,
the late Kamel Mroue, founder of the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat.
The morning paper resumed publication six days a week in 1996 after
an 11-year stoppage forced by Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's defense budget has remained unchanged
and, counting inflation, may have dropped over the past four years,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Iran's reliance on domestic resources contributed to low
spending on its defensive needs, Keyvan Khosravi, a Defense
Ministry official, was quoted as saying by the agency.
	   He did not provide figures on the budget, but said Iran had the
lowest defense budget among Middle Eastern countries.
	   Iran has claimed it is nearly self-sufficient in arms. Since
1992, Iran has unveiled its own tanks, armored personnel carriers,
missiles, and even a fighter plane.
	   In July, Iran test fired a medium-range missile, the Shahab-3,
which has a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range capable of reaching
Israel and U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian crude oil prices are likely to
average dlrs 12 a barrel in 1999, a senior oil official has said.
	   Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, a top adviser to Iran's oil
minister, told the Farsi daily Jahan-e-Eqtesad Sunday that world
oil markets will witness declining oil prices next year.
	   Given the best-case scenario _ another, drastic production cut
by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _
Iranian crude prices can only rise to dlrs 15 a barrel in 1999, he
said.
	   ``This estimation is based on the expansion of (the) world
economic recession, which seems unlikely to be controlled by next
year, and Iraq's increasing oil exports,'' Ardebili said.
	   ___
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Illegal cassettes and
computer software worth nearly dlrs 21 million were destroyed
Monday in the first anti-piracy crackdown since 1994.
	   ``We're serious about this. We have direct orders from the
government to be very strict,'' Jawad al-Redha, who is spearheading
the campaign, told The Associated Press after the huge cache was
crushed by a bulldozer.
	   The items, 238,362 in all, included video cassettes, laser
discs, computer diskettes, CD-ROMs, compact discs and music
cassettes. Superhits such as Titanic, Godzilla and Armageddon were
among the pirated videos that were destroyed.
	   They were seized in a series of raids at air and sea ports,
video and music outlets and copying sites in Dubai the past year.
	   Piracy in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes the
Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, cost the
U.S. motion picture industry dlrs 67 million in 1996.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Arab Bank, Jordan's largest financial
institution, recorded a 16 percent increase in net profits in the
first half of this year over the same period in 1997.
	   A bank balance sheet released Monday said profits between
January and June this year totaled dlrs 125.7 million, compared
with dlrs 108.6 million in the same period last year.
	   Assets in the same period grew by dlrs 1.8 billion to dlrs 22.9
billion over last year, it said.
	   The Arab bank has more than 20 branches worldwide, including in
the United States, Britain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait said Monday it was offering local and
foreign investors new opportunities in petrochemical industries
worth a total of dlrs 450 million.
	   Khaled Bou Hamra, managing director of the state-run
Petrochemical Industries Co., said the proposed projects would be
based on chemicals produced by PIC. He did not elaborate.
	   Addressing a conference on petrochemicals, the official said
return on capital in these projects could exceed 15 percent.
	   This small Gulf state is trying to attract foreign investors to
energize its oil-dependent economy that has been hit hard by low
crude prices. However, foreigners have to have Kuwaiti partners,
and they cannot own more than 49 percent of the venture.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Yemen agreed Monday to boost
trade exchange and joint ventures and establish a free trade zone
and direct maritime shipping between the two countries.
	   A memorandum signed by Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh and his
Yemeni counterpart, Abdul-Karim Iryani, said experts will outline
plans for the free trade zone in the next six months.
	   A copy of the memorandum, made available to The Associated
Press, also allows the two countries to sell the other up to dlrs
10 million in custom-free goods, avoiding dual taxation. That is in
addition to annual trade estimated at dlrs 30 million.
	   It said both sides will exchange experience and information in
various economic sectors.
	   In agriculture, Jordan and Yemen agreed to set an agenda to
organize agricultural exchange and to encourage increased private
sector investment in foodstuffs.

First direct delivery of aid for Kosovo reaches Yugoslavia

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A planeload of American medicine
and blankets arrived Monday in the capital of Montenegro, the first
direct shipment of international humanitarian aid for tens of
thousands of refugees forced from their homes by fighting in nearby
Kosovo.
	   The shipment consisted of dlrs 117,000 worth of blankets,
antibiotics and other medicines for about 40,000 people. The
supplies will be distributed here and later in Kosovo, a
predominately ethnic Albanian province in Serbia.
	   Serbia and Montenegro together form Yugoslavia. More than 40,000
Kosovo Albanian refugees have fled to Montenegro since fighting
between Albanian separatists and Serb security forces escalated
eight months ago.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade before proceeding overland to Kosovo.
Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies.
	   Under an Oct. 12 deal to defuse the crisis, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow humanitarian organizations to
work unhindered in Kosovo. Monday's flight is seen as a test of
Milosevic's commitment to that part of the deal.
	   Hugh Q. Parmer, assistant administrator for humanitarian relief
at the U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington,
accompanied Monday's flight, which will continue on to the Kosovo
capital Pristina.
	   ``With these contributions we hope to make a contribution to
these displaced persons that you have been so kind to host,''
Parmer told Montenegrin officials.
	   Parmer was chosen by U.S. President Bill Clinton to carry out
the mission. On Tuesday, he is to visit camps in Kosovo to assess
any ``special needs'' of displaced people.
	   Upwards of 300,000 people have been forced to flee their homes
in Kosovo, since fighting between the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army and Serb security forces

AMMAN, Jordan: investment in foodstuffs.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A group of Kuwaiti lawmakers is seeking to set up
a legal framework for foreign investors expected to be allowed to
enter some sectors of the country's oil industry.
	   According to a draft bill proposed by the five lawmakers, the
government should not ``make any commitments to foreign investors''
until such a legal framework is agreed on.
	   The proposal, which was obtained by The Associated Press on
Monday, was signed by five members of the National Assembly,
including the speaker, Ahmed al-Saadoun.
	   The legislators want the law to specify the rights of the
Kuwaiti government, the commitments of the foreign investors, how
they are chosen and the period of investment.
	   Lawmakers were reacting to efforts by Oil Minister Sheik Saud
al-Sabah to open some upstream operations to foreign companies.
Deals with a number of foreign firms could be signed by the end of
the year. However, these contracts will be operating service
agreements rather than production-sharing ones that are banned by
the constitution.
	   Kuwait is trying to boost its output capacity to 3 million
barrels a day from the current 2.5 million barrels a day. It is now
pumping around 1.98 million barrels a day.
	   ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Scores of Lebanese industrialists and
businessmen have opened a trade fair in Baghdad to win contracts
under Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   The opening of the exhibition coincided with the arrival of a
senior Lebanese diplomat in Baghdad, Elias al-Nemnem, who will open
the Lebanese Embassy. The embassy was shut down in 1995 when the
countries broke off diplomatic relations.
	   Faris Saad, leader of the Lebanese trade and industrial group in
Iraq, said Lebanon has signed dlrs 35 million worth of contracts
with Iraq under the current phase of the oil program.
	   Saad said 82 Lebanese companies were taking part in the trade
fair, accompanied by 120 businessmen. On show were textiles,
agricultural machinery, ready-made clothes, alcoholic drinks and
construction materials.
	   He said apart from food and medicines, the United Nations
usually does not object to the export of 41 items which fall under
the category of humanitarian goods. They include household
utensils, agricultural implements, medical glasses, air
conditioning equipment, soaps and detergents and construction
materials.
	   Fakhrideen Dakrou of the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture said
Lebanon used to export 35 percent of its agricultural produce to
Iraq before 1990 when the United Nations imposed trade sanctions on
Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
	   ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has gathered 2.5 million metric tons
(2.75 million tons) of wheat, barley and other cereals this year,
about 15 percent above last year's level, a U.N. report reveals.
	   The report, obtained by the Associated Press Monday, put Iraq's
wheat production at 1.4 million metric tons (1.54 million tons).
Barley yields were estimated at 1.1 million metric tons (1.21
million tons). Production of rice and maize also increased.
	   The bumper harvest has prompted the government to give farmers
the choice of selling their grain to state or local market.
	   In the past, farmers convicted of hoarding their surplus of
grain were given jail terms of up to 10 years. But plentiful yields
and the inlfux of food supplies under the oil-for-food deal with
the United Nations spurred the government to drop the penalty.
	   But the report, by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Oragnization,
said the domestic output would only meet one-third of the country's
needs. The rest, it said, is met through imports.
	   The oil-for-food program permits Iraq to bypass the sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited
quantities of oil to buy food and humanitarian goods.
	   Before sanctions were clamped on Iraq for invading Kuwait in
1990, the country was among the highest in the Middle East in terms
of per capita availability of cereals, the report said.

Brazilian election a referendum on austerity plan

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
plan to pull Brazil out of economic turmoil received a strong boost
with the reelection of a key ally as governor of Brazil's largest
state.
	   But opposition candidates took five of the other 12
governorships in Sunday's vote, which many Brazilians saw as a
referendum on Cardoso's austerity measures. Cardoso was expected to
announce those measures Tuesday.
	   Sao Paulo Gov. Mario Covas, a supporter of the president, was
reelected to a second term, turning back a challenge by two-time
former governor Paulo Maluf. Covas received 55 percent of the vote
to Maluf's 45 percent.
	   Sao Paulo is Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse. It
has a population of more than 34 million, accounts for more than
one-third of Brazil's economic output and holds 70 seats in the
513-seat congress.
	   Cardoso's austerity measures _ which include spending cuts and
tax increases _ must be approved by congress, and state governors
have enormous sway over local delegations.
	   Brazil is caught up in the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before spreading here. In
the past two months, investors fearful of an economic slump and
weaker currency have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from the
country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund are
discussing ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65
billion, equal to 7 percent of its gross domestic product. The
austerity plan must be tough enough to persuade the IMF to approve
emergency loans worth dlrs 30 billion.
	   ``By electing Covas, the electorate voted in favor of
austerity,'' Health Minister Jose Serra said.
	   Covas told reporters his victory showed that voters understand
``that you cannot spend more than you take in.''
	   In other states, however, Cardoso's allies did not fare as well.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho of the center-left
Democratic Labor Party was elected with 58 percent of the vote over
former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a Cardoso ally.
	   ``I will support the (austerity) measures but with
restrictions,'' Garotinho said.
	   Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, was elected governor in powerful Minas Gerais state,
with 58 percent over another Cardoso ally.
	   In southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state, Olivio
Dutra of the leftist Workers Party was elected with 51 percent of
the vote over a Cardoso backer.
	   The states of Amapa and Mato Grosso do Sul also elected Cardoso
opponents, while in Roraima and Piaui states neither winner was
antigovernment.
	   Still, none of the successful opposition candidates was a
hard-line foe of Cardoso, noted political analyst Alberto Almeida
of Rio's Fluminense Federal University.
	   ``The opposition is very moderate,'' he said. ``They want to
please their constituents at home, and ... any frontal opposition
would just create problems.''
	   In the Federal District of Brasilia, Cardoso ally Joaquim Roriz
was elected. Another Cardoso ally was elected in the state of Goias
and supporters of the president led in the states of Para, Rondonia
and Sergipe.
	   Twelve pro-Cardoso governors and two opponents were elected in
the first ballot on Oct. 4.

<TEXT>
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A prolonged conflict in Somalia has led to
low human development that will become a long-term liability for
the Somali society, a United Nations report said Monday.
	   The report said life expectancy is estimated at 41-43 years, and
mortality rate for children under five more than 25 percent. Adult
literacy, the report said, is between 14-17 percent and primary
school enrollment is 13-16 percent.
	   The report was released in Nairobi, where U.N. and most aid
agencies working in Somalia are based.
	   ``In almost any other country, any of the above mentioned
indicators would be considered a national emergency,'' said Dominik
Langenbacher, a UNDP Somalia representative.
	   Somalia has had no functioning central government since late
1991 when the late dictator President Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted
by a coalition of clan factions which later turned against each
other.
	   In recent months, faction leaders have formed fragile coalitions
that
	   are attempting to restore some semblance of law and order.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A fugitive ex-warlord who was airlifted
from the U.S. Embassy in Liberia's capital after a clash with
government security forces last month has taken refuge in Jos,
northern Nigeria, private radio stations reported on Monday.
	   Roosevelt Johnson, the former chief rival of Liberian President
Charles Taylor, was believed on the run from Liberian security
agents after he was flown from the U.S. Embassy under heavy guard
on September 26, several radio stations said.
	   At the time, Taylor said he had agreed with U.S. officials to
allow Johnson and two supporters to be evacuated to a Nigerian
prison in order to ease the strain on U.S.-Liberian relations.
	   U.S. officials gave temporary sanctuary to Johnson when the
former rebel leader and two supporters were shot at by military
officers outside the U.S. Embassy gates following a clash in the
capital.
	   Liberian officials have charged Johnson with treason and
insurrection and
	   say they will prosecute him in absentia.
	   Johnson and Taylor led rival rebel factions during the country's
civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   --
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has disbanded a
new government marketing board created last month to eliminate
corruption in the state's lucrative diamond and gold mining
industries.
	   The Minerals and Precious Stones Buying Service was suspended
last week, Kabila's finance spokesman Georges Buse told journalists
on Sunday without explaining reasons for the move.
	   The board _ created in a bid to collect some dlrs 400 million in
mineral taxes from miners who have for years circumvented official
channels _ had drawn widespread protests from the mining industry.
	   Congo's economy and new currency, the Congolese franc, are in a
state of collapse.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's main opposition New Patriotic Party
has chosen a former leader, John Agyekum Kufuor, as its
presidential candidate for elections in 2000.
	   Kufuor, an economist, was overwhelmingly voted in Saturday over
five other candidates at a party convention held in the western
city of Sunyani.
	   Kufuor was party leader for several years until the country's
last elections in 1996, which was won by incumbent President Jerry
Rawlings with a 57 percent majority over Kufuor's 40 percent.
	   Rawlings, who is widely popular despite taking power in two
military coups in the late 1970s and early 80s, will reportedly not
be running for another term.
	   Kufuor has pledged to fight for solidarity among opposition
groups in order to beat Rawlings' successor, who has yet to be
chosen.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Donors have asked for an audit of spending
by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere's foundation, which
has tried to negotiate peace in Burundi, The East African newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The biggest donor, the European Union, is concerned about the
foundation's bookkeeping, the newspaper said.
	   ``It is not a question of how much, but a question of how the
funds have been spent,'' an EU envoy, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told the respected weekly.
	   Questions have been raised about spending for the rental of cars
at exorbitant rates, and recruitment, the newspaper said.
	   The foundation has spend about dlrs 1.5 million on three rounds
of peace talks. The next round was scheduled to begin Jan. 18 in
Arusha, Tanzania.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed in violence that broke
out after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president, Hutu Melchoir Ndadaye, in October
1993.
	   Tutsis make up 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6 million,
and Hutus account for 85 percent.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ More than 150,000 refugees are expected to
enter Zambia from neighboring Congo if fighting there persists,
according to estimates by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
	   UNHCR official Ron Mponda told the government-owned Times of
Zambia that a further 500,000 Zambians working in the Congo's
mineral-rich Katanga province might also have to be repatriated if
the conflict escalates.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more background on Jaccard, CLARIFIES in 3rd graf he
disappeared in Argentina. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities on Monday requested the
arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being held
in Britain on an arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move follows a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double
nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and it is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the secret police of neighboring
Chile.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said in a
statement.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities in
Bern, who must now decide whether to pass it on to British
authorities.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
his arrest earlier this month. The arrest came at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including Spaniards, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared. Jaccard's was one of the names on the list.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   ``The Geneva authorities wish to clarify that their procedure
should not in any way prejudice those already undertaken by the
Spanish authorities, which should remain the priority,'' Bertossa
said.

Opel names new chairman amid signs of tension with GM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with replacement named for Cowger, other details,
background; CORRECTS day of resignation Gaeb to Saturday sted
Friday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., Adam Opel AG, named new top bosses Monday to resolve
a boardroom crisis caused by the recall of its chairman to Detroit.
	   Robert Hendry, head of GM's Swedish Saab division, will replace
Gary Cowger as chairman of the management board on Nov. 1, Opel
said. Opel personnel chief Wolfgang Strinz was named Hendry's
deputy.
	   Opel also tapped Hans Barth, vice president in charge of project
and production support for GM Europe, to take over as chairman of
the supervisory board, effective immediately.
	   It was Cowger's recall to Detroit after just four months to head
GM's U.S. labor relations that reportedly sparked the boardroom
turmoil.
	   In a surprise move, Hans Wilhelm Gaeb resigned as supervisory
board chairman Saturday after almost 18 years in office in what was
seen as a sign of worsening relations between Opel and its U.S.
parent.
	   GM is seeking to merge its two big, independent automotive units
for North America and the rest of the world into one to respond
better to markets worldwide. The new boss is an American, G.
Richard Wagoner Jr.
	   An Opel statement on Saturday said only that Gaeb's resignation
was due to differing perceptions of the company's business
strategies.
	   Opel, GM's biggest European subsidiary, has suffered from
declining market share and lower profits in recent years.
	   A spokesman for the IG Metall union, Joerg Barczynski, said GM
was hurting Opel with the personnel changes. ``GM managers in
America are ruining Opel's good reputation,'' he said in Monday's
Bild newspaper.
	   At the extraordinary supervisory board meeting Monday, Opel also
chose Michael Burns, head of GM's European Operations in Zurich,
Switzerland, to join the board to fill Gaeb's vacancy.

Dutch Queen Beatrix to visit Yeltsin in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Queen Beatrix will meet with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin during her five-day visit to Russia
next month, the Dutch government said Monday.
	   Beatrix, accompanied by her consort Prince Claus, will arrive in
Moscow on Nov. 25. She will be welcomed by Yeltsin, who will also
host a state dinner in her honor a day later.
	   While in Moscow, Beatrix will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier and visit the Russian parliament.
	   Her visit will also take her to Dmitrov, about 70 kilometers (40
miles) outside Moscow, where she will visit a Dutch-owned company.
Dmitrov is located in an agricultural region which holds close
economic ties with the northern Dutch province of Flevoland.
	   Her last stop will be St. Petersburg, where she is scheduled to
visit several museums, including the Pavlovsk Palace and the
Hermitage Museum.

Iraqi trade minister visits Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Iraq's trade minister discussed his country's
food-for-oil program when he met with French officials at the
beginning of a two-day visit Monday, the French Foreign Ministry
said.
	   Mohamed Mehdi Saleh was scheduled to meet with his French
counterpart Jacques Dondoux after talks with Foreign Ministry
officials, the ministry said in a statement.
	   Saleh is in charge of the food-for-oil program that allows the
limited sale of Iraqi oil in exchange for foodstuffs and other
humanitarian aid while a U.N. embargo remains in effect.
	   Saleh's visit ``is an occasion to assess the application'' of
U.N. Resolution 986, the food-for-oil initiative approved in
December 1996, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   During the talks, France also called on Iraq ``to continue its
good cooperation with the United Nations'' on the food-for-oil
program. It also pressed Iraq to fully cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Once one of Iraq's biggest trading partners, France is seeking
to end the embargo clamped on Baghdad since the invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990.
	   The forces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein were crushed by
U.S.-led allies in early 1991, and a U.N. settlement requires Iraq
rid itself of weapons of mass destruction before the embargo is
lifted.

Five officers killed in fighting with rebels in southern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least five senior army officers were
killed during fighting with Iraqi dissidents in southern Iraq this
month, a key Iraqi opposition group said Monday.
	   The Iraqi Communist Party, based in Kurdish-controlled northern
Iraq, also reported widespread anti-government disturbances in the
province of Nasirriya, 380 kilometers (235 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate word from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   In the statement, the party said most of the fighting occurred
in the marshes around Nasirriya. Large numbers of troops and five
senior officers were killed, the statement said. The dead included
a brigade commander, Col. Mubder Shu'eib al-Jibouri.
	   It did not give a figure on rebel losses.
	   Earlier this month, the party and another group, the Iran-based
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said Iraqi
forces had launched an offensive in southern Iraq in an attempt to
wipe out bases of Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   Tens of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge in the
marshes in southern Iraq after soldiers crushed a Shiite rebellion
in the south following Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The U.S. Congress voted this month to direct the Pentagon to
channel up to dlrs 97 million in military aid to Iraqi opposition
groups trying to topple President Saddam Hussein.

Peru, Ecuador sign historic peace treaty

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty
Monday ending a 57-year dispute over a slice of Amazon jungle that
brought them to war three times.
	   As dignitaries from three continents looked on, the foreign
ministers of the two South American nations signed the accord in
Brazil's capital, where most of the peace talks took place.
	   The treaty sets the boundary on a contested 48-mile (78-km)
section of their border in the Andean foothills. Both laid claim to
the jungle-cloaked area that was left undefined in the 1942 Rio de
Janeiro Protocol that set territorial limits.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
looked on from a dais, sitting on either side of Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   They were accompanied by Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile,
Carlos Menem of Argentina, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Andres
Pastrana of Colombia. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain
also attended, while the United States was represented by envoy
Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former aide to U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``It's been a good week for peace accords, with Ireland and
Israel and now this,'' said McLarty. ``Hopefully, Kosovo will move
forward in the near term.''
	   The treaty was brokered by the United States, Brazil, Argentina
and Chile.
	   Under the pact, the disputed section of the border will follow
the heights of the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, as Peru
had claimed.
	   But a hill within Peru's territory called Tiwintza will be
granted to Ecuador's government as private property, even though it
will remain under Peruvian sovereignty.
	   That would make ownership of the 250 acres (1-square-kilometer)
somewhat comparable to an individual Ecuadoran owning property in
Peru. The Peruvian government has 30 months to build a road from
Tiwintza to the Ecuadoren border.
	   The agreement also calls for two contiguous national parks to be
created in the disputed area.
	   The two neighbors fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the
region. Tiwintza has special significance for Ecuador, because its
troops successfully defended it against repeated assaults by
Peruvian troops during the 1995 border war. Twelve Ecuadorean
soldiers are believed to be buried there.
	   Peace talks began in 1995. The presidents of the two nations met
in August to work out the final details.
	   As a condition for brokering the peace talks, the four nations
involved in the negotiations secured approval in advance from the
congresses of Peru and Ecuador.
	   Beyond setting the boundary between the two nations, foreign
minister Jose Ayala of Ecuador and Fernando Trazegnies of Peru
signed agreements on security measures and on trade and navigation.

Muslim leader in Chechnya escapes attempt on life

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a car carrying a senior Muslim
cleric in breakaway Chechnya on Monday, but he was not hurt,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   The attack came one day after a similar car bomb killed
Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid Bargishev.
	   The cleric, Mufti Akhmad Khadzhi Kadyrov, was approaching his
home in the Chechen capital of Grozny when the bomb went off under
his Mercedes 600, wounding his driver, ITAR-Tass and Interfax
reported.
	   Kadyrov and his bodyguard scrambled out of the burning car after
the blast, which also destroyed a small building and blew out
windows nearby.
	   It was the second attack against Kadyrov. His office was
seriously damaged earlier this year when a bomb attached to a wall
exploded, but Kadyrov escaped unhurt.
	   Kadyrov said Monday's attack and Bargishev's killing were
connected. Chechnya's deputy Prosecutor General Vakha Aigumov said
the bombs used in both explosions were identical, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Anti-kidnapping officials blamed Sunday's explosion on
Bargishev's promise to launch a major offensive against
hostage-takers, and his recent success in securing the release of
several captives, including a British couple and 24 Russian
soldiers.
	   Chechnya's first deputy security minister, Abu Movsayev, said
the Russian military may have been behind the killing. Bargishev
had recently challenged a claim by the Russian prosecutor general's
office that it had freed the Russian servicemen from captivity,
Movsayev said.
	   Russia's former chief negotiator with Chechnya, Ivan Rybkin,
blamed ``certain political, financial and religious forces from
Middle East countries'' for the two attacks.
	   ``This was the job of outsiders from Jordan and Saudi Arabia ...
trying to unleash a civil war in Chechnya,'' Rybkin said. He added
that the accusation was ``borne out by concrete evidence,'' but did
not elaborate.
	   Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry in the southern Russian region
of Dagestan offered Monday to help combat hostage-taking in
neighboring Chechnya after the attack on Bargishev, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also
been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in
Chechnya.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.

Ovett, Hemery among candidates for president of UK Athletics

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Olympic champions and world
record-holders Steve Ovett and David Hemery are among the
candidates for president of UK Athletics, the governing body of
British track and field.
	   Ovett won the gold medal in the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics and is a former record-holder at 1,500 meters, one mile
and two miles. He has been working as a TV commentator.
	   Hemery was the 400-meter hurdles champion at the 1968 Mexico
City Olympics and held the world record in the event. He has since
been a coach, teacher, manager and writer.
	   The three other candidates for the post are Sir Eddie
Kulukundis, who has given financial assistance to athletes since
the early 1970s; former triple jumper and coach Tom McNab, and
former runner and British team manager Mike Turner.
	   All British athletics clubs are eligible to vote, with the
results scheduled to be announced on Nov. 17.
	   UK Athletics took over the running of the sport in Britain after
the financial collapse of the British Athletic Federation. Former
5,000-meter world record-holder David Moorcroft has run the
organization since last year.
	   Meanwhile, the BBC said Monday it had won the broadcasting
rights for British athletics from Channel Four. The agreement
covers all key meets in Britain, indoor and outdoor, from 1999 to
2002.
	   The deal came just 10 days after the BBC lost rights to televise
England cricket matches to Channel Four.

	   Porat, an opponent of the withdrawal agreement, said the
suggested date for holding early elections would be March 16.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace agreement
over the next 12 weeks.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet and to be voted on later Monday.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli security guard in Hebron
raised new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal
can withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were walking along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive
by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped on the
pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car sped away.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot in the neck.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants had used the victim's
car to escape and requested that Palestinian police help in finding
the vehicle.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader

 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities on Monday also requested
the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being
held in Britain on an arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move follows a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double
nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the Chilean secret police.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities,
who will decide whether to pass it on to British authorities.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
his arrest earlier this month. The arrest came at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule that ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including Spaniards, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared. Jaccard's was one of the names on the list.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Bertossa added that the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet
should be given priority.

Official: Vatican wants to attend final status talks on Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - With Mideast peace talks back on track, the
Vatican's foreign minister said Monday the Holy See wants to join
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the future of
Jerusalem and its holy sites.
	   Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran said that Israel and the
Palestinians would only benefit from bringing all those with a
stake in the holy city into the talks.
	   ``The (Israeli and Palestinian) negotiators are expected to
include the participation of the sponsors of the peace process, and
other parties could also be invited to contribute,'' Tauran said.
	   His speech opened a two-day conference on Jerusalem attended by
some 40 Catholic clergymen from all over the world.
	   Tauran's comments came just three days after Israel and the
Palestinians cleared a major hurdle on the way to final status
talks by concluding an interim agreement on a West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   Under the original timetable, the talks were to be completed by
May 4, 1999. However, negotiations have not yet begin, and the
deadline no longer seems realistic.
	   In negotiations on a permanent peace agreement, the two sides
will try to tackle the most difficult issues, including the future
of Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the
capital of their would-be state. But Israel, which captured the
Arab sector in the 1967 Middle East war, has maintained it will not
accept a divided capital.
	   Tauran cautioned that any deal must ensure that Jerusalem's
religious and cultural heritage is maintained. The Vatican sees
Jerusalem as ``the symbol and the national center of both the
peoples that claim it as their capital,'' Tauran said.
	   Disputes over the status of Jerusalem soured relations between
Israel and the Vatican for many years, but the two established
diplomatic relations in 1993, the year Israel signed its
breakthrough peace agreement with the Palestinians.

BayStars edge Lions 2-1, win first Japan championship in 38 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ The Yokohama BayStars edged the Seibu
Lions 2-1 Monday on Norihiro Komada's two-run, eighth-inning double
and won the Japan Series for the first time in 38 years.
	   The Central League champion BayStars won four games to two,
closing out the Pacific League champion Lions with a double play
with the potential tying and winning runs on base in the top of the
ninth.
	   The BayStars had reached only one other Japan Series, in 1960,
when they won.
	   Playing before more than 29,000 spectators at his team's home
ground, Komada doubled home two runs against Fumiya Nishiguchi in
the bottom of the eighth inning.
	   Nishiguchi, who was 13-12 with a 3.38 ERA during this regular
season, had held the BayStars to only two hits before that.
	   With one out in the eighth, Toshio Haru walked and then was safe
at second on Takanori Suzuki's ground ball when Lions second
baseman Hiroyuki Takagi missed a tag attempt.
	   Robert Rose, formerly with the California Angels, flied out
before Komada's winning double.
	   In the top of the ninth, the BayStars sent in ace reliever
Kazuhiro Sasaki, who had 45 saves during the regular season.
	   First batter Hiroyuki Takagi hit a liner and left fielder Suzuki
lost the ball in the lights, allowing Takagi to reach third.
	   Sasaki struck out pinch hitter Rudy Pemberton, formerly with the
Boston Red Sox, but walked another pinch hitter, Domingo Martinez,
formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team.
	   Takagi scored when the BayStars were unable to turn Satoshi
Nakajima's grounder into a double play. Nakajima was safe at first
and Martinez at second.
	   But Sasaki then got pinch hitter Yoshiaki Kanemura to ground
into the series-ending double play.
	   The BayStars' Suzuki, who hit .480 in the series and drove in
eight runs, was named the most valuable player and received a car
as the prize.
	   He had led the Central League with a .337 average in the regular
season.
	   The BayStars won the first two games 9-4 and 4-0, and the Lions
took the next two 7-2 and 4-2. The BayStars took Game 5 17-5 on
Saturday, setting up Monday's championship chance.

Parliament hardliners begin process of holding early elections

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost the
first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli security
guard was shot in the neck and his body thrown from a moving car in
an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over a
12-week period, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
The suggested date for the elections was March 16.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hardliners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down the prime minister.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by a special
majority of 60 of the 120 legislators. Supporters of the bill said
they were confident they could pass the legislation.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace
agreement.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet and to be voted on later Monday.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli security guard in Hebron
raised new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal
can withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car drive

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued Monday
that the former Chilean dictator's arrest on a Spanish warrant is
illegal because ex-rulers have immunity from prosecution for acts
committed in an ``official capacity.''
	   ``That does not raise the specter of a future Hitler going
unpunished,'' said lawyer Clive Nicholls, arguing in the High Court
that international tribunals can still apply to try such people.
	   In Switzerland, Geneva state authorities also set in motion
extradition proceedings, seeking to question Pinochet about a
student with dual Swiss-Chilean nationality, Alexis Jaccard, who
disappeared in 1977.
	   Nicholls said warrants issued by a Spanish magistrate were also
illegal because Pinochet is not Spanish.
	   As Nicholls led a phalanx of lawyers appearing for Pinochet, a
Chilean military aircraft with medical personnel and equipment was
on standby at Brize Norton, a Royal Air Force base northwest of
London, to take the 82-year-old general home if he wins the case.
	   The hearing before Lord Justice Konrad Schiemann and two other
judges was expected to last through part of Tuesday.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed in a private
London clinic at the instigation of the Spanish magistrate seeking
his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism
during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   The initial Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including
Spaniards.
	   Lawyers said Monday that a second warrant, broader and
superseding the first, was issued late last week. It asserts
Pinochet was responsible for murders between January 1976 and
December 1992, torture between 1988 and 1992 and kidnappings
between 1982 and 1992.
	   Numbers and nationalities of the victims were not given.
	   Alun Jones, representing British and Spanish prosecutors and the
British police, said Pinochet stands accused of killing 4,000
people _ and the warrant could be amended further.
	   ``Fresh information is coming all the time,'' Jones told the
court.
	   Chilean exiles, fearful that Pinochet will be allowed home on
humanitarian grounds or that Britain will bow to pressure from the
Chilean government to release him, crowded into the visitors'
gallery in the oak-panelled courtroom.
	   The general remained under police guard in his room at the
London Clinic, where he underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9. Right-wing
Chilean senators, in London pressing for his release, say he is ill
and frail.
	   In papers submitted in court, Pinochet's lawyers said failing to
give him immunity opened the prospect of Queen Elizabeth II being
extradited, during a visit to America, to Argentina to face charges
of murdering Argentine soldiers during the 1982 Falkland Island
war.
	   Nicholls said British Home Secretary Jack Straw should have
overtunred the arrest warrant.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government rejects
Chile's arguments that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity, and says
the issue is a legal one and it cannot intervene.
	   Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, has been a regular visitor to Britain.

Dalai Lama opens German seminar with call against materialism

<TEXT>
	   SCHNEVERDINGEN, Germany (AP) _ The Dalai Lama, the spiritual
leader of Tibetan Buddhism, opened a weeklong seminar Monday by
advising followers to seek inner spiritual growth before trying to
save the world.
	   About 8,000 participants from around the globe sat or knelt
barefoot on cold wooden floors to hear the Tibetan leader speak in
an old military training barracks in Schneverdingen, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) outside the northern city of Hamburg.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who has lived in exile in India
since China suppressed a Tibetan independence movement in 1959,
said during a Hamburg news conference Sunday that the Chinese
government occasionally signals a ``green light'' toward
understanding on the status of Tibet.
	   At the same time, the Dalai Lama said China continues to
practice ``cultural genocide'' in Tibet. He criticized China for
supporting armed civilian groups and emphasized that human rights
conditions in Tibet remain troubling. ``Time is running out for we
Tibetans,'' he said.
	   He stressed that Tibet currently seeks not independence but
widespread autonomy within China, and he expressed confidence that
Germany's new government, led by Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder,
would continue a 1996 pledge by the previous government to support
Tibet's goal.
	   Wearing dark red robes trimmed in gold, the 63-year-old
spiritual leader told followers Monday to avoid materialism.
``Money alone is not a problem,'' he said, advising that personal
growth must come before worldly successes.
	   Buddhism currently is fashionable in the West: Celebrities
including actor Richard Gere and singer Tina Turner are followers,
and the rich and famous crowd Tibetan fund-raisers. But while
Westerners are attracted to the novelty of Buddhism, the Dalai Lama
explained, it is better to pursue one's native religion.
	   To that end, he said, his seminar in Germany is advertised not
as instruction in Buddhism but in personal growth and spiritual
expansion. People who turn to Buddhism because they seek something
new often gain insights that lead them back to their initial
beliefs, the Dalai Lama explained.
	   The seminar lasts until Nov. 1, with participants staying in
lodging at the old military ground. The Dalai Lama will sleep at
the Tibet Center in Hamburg.
	   The Dalai Lama was born Tenzin Gyatso in 1935 to a peasant
family in the Tibetan village of Takster. In a Tibetan ceremony, he
was recognized at age 2 as the 14th Dalai Lama, or reincarnation of
his predecessor and was enthroned in 1940.

Reactor restarted at Russian nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A reactor at a nuclear power plant in northern
Russia has been restarted after more than three years of
reconstruction, a news report said Monday.
	   New radiation and fire safety equipment has been installed on
the No. 3 reactor of the Sosnovy Bor plant, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported, citing the plant's press service.
	   The plant, located near St. Petersburg, is the main energy
provider for Russia's second-largest city and the surrounding
region. Also known as the Leningrad plant, it is equipped with
RBMK-1000 reactors, a modified version of the reactor that exploded
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in 1986.
	   After the Leningrad plant's No. 3 reactor is brought to its full
1,000-megawatt capacity in the next few days, another reactor will
be stopped for repairs until mid-December, the report said.
	   Plant officials have recently said that only two of the plant's
four reactors are likely to be operating during the winter because
of a lack of funds. But now they hope to keep three reactors
operational starting in January, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   However, the plant has stored only enough nuclear fuel for one
month, it said.

Low turnout forces repeat of Bucharest mayoral elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Bucharest will repeat mayoral
elections next week, due to low turnout blamed on voter apathy, an
election official said Monday.
	   Only 34.4 percent of Bucharest's 1.7 million eligible voters
cast their ballots Sunday, far short of the 50 percent needed for
the vote to be valid, said Cristian Panait, head of Bucharest's
Election Bureau.
	   The poor turnout _ the lowest any election since the 1989
overthrow of communism _ means the election will be held again on
Nov. 1.
	   To secure outright victory in the repeat election, the leading
candidate needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote. Failing
that, a runoff between the top two candidates will be held a week
later.
	   Headlines in local newspapers Monday, blasted the slight
turnout, saying ``We voted in vain,'' ``Voters Don't Give a Damn''
and ``Great Disgust.''
	   ``Candidates did not manage to convince Bucharesters to overcome
the apathy generated by promises they never carried out,'' wrote
Eugen Ovidiu Chirovici in Curierul National daily on Monday.
	   Sunday's ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected
mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned
from that job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same
time.
	   Bucharest, a city of 3 million, is overcrowded and plagued with
a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and pollution. Since 1989
many problems have gotten worse, as the city's population has
increased.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty
Monday ending a 57-year dispute over a slice of Amazon jungle that
brought them to war three times.
	   As dignitaries from three continents looked on, the foreign
ministers of the two South American nations signed the accord in
Brazil's capital, where most of the peace talks took place.
	   The treaty sets the boundary on a contested 48-mile (78-km)
section of their border in the Andean foothills. Both laid claim to
the jungle-cloaked area that was left undefined in the 1942 Rio de
Janeiro Protocol that set territorial limits.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador
looked on from a dais, sitting on either side of Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   After the treaty was signed, Fujimori and Mahuad signed a
wide-ranging agreement for cooperation on security, energy,
tourism, trade and navigation.
	   Also at the ceremony were Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile,
Carlos Menem of Argentina, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Andres
Pastrana of Colombia. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain
also attended, while the United States was represented by envoy
Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former aide to U.S.
President Bill Clinton.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost the
first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli guard was
shot in the neck and his body thrown from a moving car in an
apparent attack by Palestinian militants. There was no claim of
responsibility.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new agreement under which Israel
is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hard-liners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down Netanyahu.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading could be
held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in three
readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by at least 60
votes in the 120-member legislature. Supporters said they were
confident they could pass the legislation.
	   Porat, an opponent of the peace agreement, said the suggested
date for holding early elections would be March 16.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace agreement
over the next 12 weeks.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet to be voted on later Monday.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli guard in Hebron raised
new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal can
withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   The killing occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in the
downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is under
Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were walking when they saw a car
drive by at high speed. A car door opened and the body was dumped
on the pavement, the journalists said. The car sped away.
	   Palestinian paramedics pronounced the victim dead at the scene.
They said he had been shot in the neck.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants had used the victim's
car to escape.

Lebanon says peace deal `disappointing,' criticizes Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon criticized the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement as ``a big disappointment'' Monday
and accused Palestinians of abandoning Arabs who have supported
them.
	   ``The agreement was a big disappointment compared with Arab
aspirations,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said of the deal
reached Friday. ``The Palestinian side is paying a very high
price.''
	   Criticism of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is common in
Lebanon, where the country's own talks with the Jewish state have
been deadlocked for more than two years. Negotiations between
Israel and Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon, also have gone
nowhere since 1996.
	   Both Lebanon and Syria say they will negotiate simultaneously
and are demanding an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and
from Syria's Golan Heights. But the Palestinians are negotiating
their own peace with the Israelis.
	   President Elias Hrawi, speaking to a conference of Arab
engineers Monday, lashed out at the Palestinians for going it alone
in their agreement with Israel, which offers assurances they will
crack down on anti-Israeli militants in return for Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   ``All the Arabs have carried the burden of their cause for 50
years. They made Lebanon carry the burden of their ambitions and
maneuvering. ... They've undermined the (Arab) confrontation front
and support and destroyed our state,'' Hrawi said.
	   Many Lebanese blame Palestinian guerrillas, who ran a
state-within-a-state in Lebanon in the 1970s, for contributing to
Lebanon's devastating 1975-90 civil war. Many Palestinians, in
turn, feel Arab states have cynically used their cause.

35 in 11th graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Basque regional elections, the first held
since armed separatists declared a cease-fire five weeks ago,
opened the door wider to peace, the Spanish government said Monday.
	   Basques crowded the polls in record numbers Sunday, favoring the
more extreme versions of the region's traditional split between
those who seek independence and those who oppose it.
	   But Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told national Spanish
radio that the result was ``the best possible for peace,'' because
the Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was now an
undisputed major force within the regional Basque Parliament.
	   Mayor Oreja said that with the rise of the Popular Party, the
Basque parliament could not disregard that ``plurality is the
essence of the Basque Country.''
	   The government has not indicated what Aznar's next step will be.
He had taken a tough stance since the armed separatist group ETA
declared an open-ended cease-fire, insisting that the group accept
the election results and give up its arms for talks to go forward.
	   ETA supporters have urged the government, as a gesture of
goodwill, to transfer separatist prisoners scattered around the
country to institutions in the Basque country.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, politically allied with the ETA commandos,
said the election favored independence. The party is a new name for
the traditional Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The party spokesman, Arnaldo Otegi, told the Barcelona daily La
Vanguardia that the strong support for Basque nationalist parties
was a vote for ``peace, liberty and self-determination,''
	   Otegi said his party would not join any coalition government,
but would be an active participant in Parliament, La Vanguardia
reported Monday.
	   Although the lineup in the 75-seat Parliament between
pro-independence and anti-independence seats basically stayed the
same, there were important changes in the makeup on each side of
the aisle.
	   The voters, more than 70 percent of those registered turned out,
cast ballots giving three separatist parties a total of 41 seats
and four parties opposed to breaking up Spanish union, 34 seats,
similar to the existing lineup.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist (separatist) Party dropped a
seat, but won 21, enough to give it the right to form the
government.
	   Juan Jose Ibarretxe, Nationalist Party leader charged with
seeking a coalition government, said Monday, ``Let's see what we
can do in this country without excluding anybody.''
	   But the political map's variations are what encouraged Mayor
Oreja and others to see the elections as the curtain raiser to a
more vigorous peace process.
	   The big winners were Aznar's Popular Party and the Euskal
Herritarrok (Herri Batasuna) political coalition linked to the ETA.
	   Aznar's Popular Party jumped from 11 to 16 seats to become the
second most popular party in the regional Parliament.
	   The party is strongly identified with the Spanish government's
tough anti-terrorist policies and totally opposed to making
concessions to ETA or changing the constitution to allow Basque
secession.
	   The Socialist Party, the main opposition to Aznar's government
in the national parliament but on the same side of the fence in the
Basque country, gained two seats to total 14, although it fell from
second to fourth place in the voting.
	   Euskal Herritarrok gained two seats to 14, becoming the third
largest electoral force.
	   ETA _ the letters stand in the Basque language for Basque

Strong earthquake rocks West Nusa Tenggara capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake rocked parts of
Indonesia's West Nusa Tenggara province Monday, causing panic among
residents, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
casualties.
	   The magnitude 5.1 quake jolted the provincial capital of Mataram
and surrounding areas at 3:22 a.m. (1922 GMT Sunday), the official
Antara news agency said.
	   It quoted Tirta Wijaya, a spokesman for the local Meteorological
and Geophysical Agency, as saying the quake was centered beneath
the Indian Ocean, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of
Denpasar, capital of the neighboring tourist island of Bali.
	   The quake was also felt in Denpasar, Antara said.
	   Mataram, on the island of Lombok, is about 1,000 kilometers (625
miles) east of Jakarta. It was the second earthquake to hit Mataram
since Sept. 29, when the area was hit by a quake of 6.3 magnitude,
also without damage or casualties.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 5 could cause considerable
damage in populated areas near the epicenter.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from North America across to Japan, through
Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and New Zealand.

Countries in transition trade tips on privatization

<TEXT>
	   DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) _ Nations in transition to a free market
economy from the Baltics to the Balkans met in this medievil city
Monday to trade experiences and tips on privatizing formerly
state-owned enterprises.
	   Croatian Premier Zlatko Matesa, who opened the two-day
international forum gathering 12 European nations, termed
privatization as a key to establishing a free market.
	   Presenting the Croatian model, which he said was near
completion, Matesa recognized restructuring and management as
elements that should go hand in hand with the process to sustain
the reform momentum.
	   Of 2,817 state-run enterprises, Croatia has privatized 2,553
firms valued at 84 billion kuna (dlrs 14 billion) and is now
preparing to tackle public utilities and monopolies.
	   Total proceeds generated from the process so far were estimated
at 12.1 billion kuna (dlrs 2 billion).
	   Matesa, who cited the effects of the nation's war for
independence in 1991 as an additional obstacle, said that in the
weeks to come the government would draft a law on privatizating the
state-run telecommunications sector, which would then be followed
by the INA oil and gas refinery and HEP, the energy utility.
	   The government would also seek an international tender for the
nation's largest bank, Privredna Banka, and two other leading banks
next week, Matesa said.
	   He pointed to a sound and stable overall economic environment as
an important buffer for a succesful privatization process,
especially amid uncertain conditions prevailing at the moment
across the globe.
	   ``Despite differences in approach and the specific situations in
various countries in transition, we have many things in common,
many things that can be compared, critically reviewed or praised,''
said Milan Kovac, Croatia's minister of finance.
	   In the course of the two-day conference, heads of privatization
agencies in Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and
Macedonia will present case models of their respective countries.

Spain says Basque election results favor peace

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 35 to 34 seats, graf 11 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Basque regional elections, the first since
armed separatists declared a cease-fire five weeks ago, opened the
door wider to peace, the Spanish government said Monday.
	   Basques crowded the polls in record numbers Sunday, favoring
more extreme versions of the region's traditional split between
those who seek independence and those who oppose it.
	   But Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told national Spanish
radio that the result was ``the best possible for peace,'' because
the Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was now an
undisputed major force within the regional Basque Parliament.
	   Mayor Oreja said that with the rise of the Popular Party, the
Basque parliament could not disregard that ``plurality is the
essence of the Basque Country.''
	   The government has not indicated what Aznar's next step will be.
He had taken a tough stance since the armed separatist group ETA
declared a cease-fire, insisting that the group accept the election
results and give up its arms for talks to go forward.
	   ETA supporters have urged the government, as a gesture of
goodwill, to transfer separatist prisoners scattered around the
country to institutions in the Basque country.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, politically allied with the ETA commandos,
said the election favored independence. The party is a new name for
the traditional Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The party spokesman, Arnaldo Otegi, told the Barcelona daily La
Vanguardia that the strong support for Basque nationalist parties
was a vote for ``peace, liberty and self-determination,''
	   Otegi said his party would not join any coalition government,
but would be an active participant in Parliament, La Vanguardia
reported Monday.
	   Although the lineup in the 75-seat Parliament between
pro-independence and anti-independence seats basically stayed the
same, there were important changes in the makeup on each side of
the aisle.
	   The voters, more than 70 percent of those registered turned out,
cast ballots giving three separatist parties a total of 41 seats
and four parties opposed to breaking up Spanish union, 34 seats,
similar to the existing lineup.

Rescuers find helicopter wreckage near Mount Everest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Rescuers on Monday found the wreckage of
a French-built Ecureuil helicopter that crashed near Mount Everest
last week killing all three people aboard, the government said.
	   The bodies of the victims, all Nepalese, were flown to their
families.
	   The Department of Civil Aviation said the wreckage was found on
the banks of Adheri River at an altitude of 2,360 meters (7,800
feet), about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of the Nepalese
capital, Katmandu.
	   The last radio contact was made by the pilot of the Asian
Airlines helicopter on Saturday at 11:26 a.m. local time (0540 GMT)
just three minutes after takeoff from the Lukla Airport situated at
2,800 meters (9,240 feet).
	   The helicopter was on way to pick up a dead body at Jiri, a
10-minute flight from the airport, and fly it to Katmandu.
	   Investigators are yet to determine the cause of the accident but
airport officials said bad weather caused the helicopter to crash.

Thai rice production to show slight dip because of drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's rice production for 1998-99
will drop only slightly despite a severe drought, an official
estimate released Monday showed.
	   Rice production will total 18,500,501 metric tons, down 1.5
percent from 18,788,788 tons in 1997-98, according to a new
forecast obtained from the government's Office of Agricultural
Economics by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   An Agricultural Economics official said the decline is minimal
because production will be strong in central Thailand, and because
good prices have encouraged farmers around the nation to plant more
rice.
	   The new forecast, based on firsthand investigations of rice
plantations, is a downward revision from the department's previous
forecast of 18,506,107 tons, which was released in June.
	   The decline in expected output was a consequence of a severe
drought in northeastern Thailand, which provided the largest
percentage of the country's rice crop in 1997-98.
	   Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. The Office of
Agricultural Economics is part of the Agricultural and Cooperatives
Ministry.

Mary Servaes-Beij, singer of Dutch sentimental tunes, dead at 79
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Mary Servaes-Beij, the Dutch
singer whose trademark sentimental tunes sold more than 16 million
copies, has died. She was 79.
	   Best known as the ``Singer Without a Name,'' Servaes-Beij died
Friday of cardiac arrest in a nursing home in the southern Dutch
town of Horn. She had long suffered from Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases.
	   Servaes-Beij's repertoire included some 600 popular folk songs
such as ``Oh Daddy Dear,'' ``Mexico'' and ``Mandolin in Nicosia,''
many containing doleful lyrics mirroring her own difficult life.
	   She was born in the western Dutch city of Leiden in 1919, the
eighth of 10 children. Plagued by a hip disease, she was often
bedridden. ``Bitter poverty, an abusive father and bad health _ she
was spared little,'' the daily De Volkskrant wrote Monday.
	   Many of the sorrows in her life naturally found their way into
her songs.
	   In one of her hits, she sings with a trembling voice:
	   ``Oh, daddy dear drink no more,
	   ``I've asked for so many times,
	   ``For mummy cries time and time again
	   ``Oh, daddy dear drink no more.''
	   Servaes-Beij will be buried in the southern Dutch town of
Stramproy on Friday. Family details were not disclosed.

Lit cigarette sparks explosion in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A lit cigarette ignited open cans of
illicit gasoline at a blackmarket storage house in a village near
Lagos, burning four people alive, Nigeria's news agency reported
Monday.
	   Firefighters discovered four bodies charred beyond recognition
in the Sunday night blaze which occurred in the Managere village on
the western edge of the capital, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported.
	   The building was destroyed to prevent the flames from spreading
to neighboring houses.
	   The accident came just eight days after a gasoline-fed inferno
in the village of Jesse about 300 kilometers (190 miles) to the
southeast killed an estimated 700 people.
	   Many of the victims of the Jesse explosion had had allegedly
been trying to scavenge gasoline gushing from a leaking pipeline
when it ignited _ possibly by a cigarette or the spark of tools
used by vandals who may have broke open the pipe.
	   Despite being the world's sixth largest oil producer, years of
government corruption and mismanagement have caused Nigeria's
consumer petroleum industry to collapse _ causing long lines at the
gas pumps and a huge market for blackmarket gasoline sold in small
glass bottles.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader

 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities Monday requested the
arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being held
in Britain on another arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move to set Swiss extradition proceedings in motion follows
a criminal complaint filed last week by the widow of Alexis
Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and it is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the secret police of neighboring
Chile.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said in a
statement.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities in
Bern, who will decide whether to transmit it to Britain.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
being arrested earlier this month at the request of a Spanish
magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture
and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared. Jaccard's
was one of the names on the list.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Bertossa added that the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet
should be given priority. A Spanish request for legal assistance
from Switzerland, made Friday, has been passed on to Geneva
authorities.
	   No details have been given of the content of the Spanish
request.

the typhoon-strength winds that slammed the Philippines and Taiwan,
moved toward the Taiwan Strait on Monday, after killing dozens of
people and causing millions of dollars in damage.
	   Babs killed at least 156 people in the Philippines, triggered
massive flooding and landslides in Taiwan and hit Hong Kong with
strong winds before weakening and heading toward mainland China.
	   Philippine officials said Monday the storm damaged 3.1 billion
pesos (dlrs 73.3 million) worth of crops and property. At least 11
people were missing, including two Taiwanese fishermen who fell
from their boat near Camarines Sur province in the Philippines'
hard-hit Bicol region. Ten other Taiwanese were rescued from the
boat.
	   A landslide swamped a house in Sanchih in suburban Taipei Monday
night, police reported. They said rescuers were trying to locate
two people believed buried in the debris.
	   Babs, which packed winds of more than 140 kph (87 mph) at its
height, weakened and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm
Sunday night by the Hong Kong Observatory. Around 0500 GMT, winds
were estimated between 41 and 62 kph (25 and 38 mph).
	   The storm was located 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Hong
Kong at 9 p.m. (1300 GMT), the Hong Kong Observatory reported. It
said Babs was moving at about 15 kph (9.3 mph) north-northeast
toward the Taiwan Strait.
	   The observatory canceled a typhoon warning in Hong Kong Monday
night.
	   Strong winds and rain hit Hong Kong late Sunday and early
Monday, but no serious storm-related injuries were reported.
	   In Taiwan, Babs' outer fringes brought heavy rains to the whole
island, with eastern Hualien recording 700 millimeters (28 inches)
of rain in a 36-hour period.
	   The storm triggered more landslides in various parts of the
island, disrupting traffic and trapping people in mountains.
Several rivers, including Taipei's Keelung River, swelled their
banks and flooded nearby towns.
	   In northern Keelung, a retaining wall at a hillside community
collapsed, and police evacuated residents from 65 households.

Judges call strike, joining university teachers, newspapers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algiers courtrooms were empty Monday,
the start of a rare three-day strike by judges -- the latest in a
surge of work stoppages that have shut down universities and a
group of newspapers.
	   The strikes, on the heels of a two-week walkout at state-owned
Air Algeria, added to the already charged atmosphere dominating
this North African nation as it prepares for early presidential
elections.
	   In September, President Liamine Zeroual announced plans to cut
short his term, set to end in the year 2000, and hold elections
before the end of February.
	   Since then, strikes have blossomed, and the voices of special
interest groups have drowned out issues, including Algeria's war
against Islamic insurgents who have been trying to topple the
military-backed government since 1992.
	   The National Union of Magistrates decided to strike through
Wednesday to protest an article published Oct. 7 in the
privately-owned daily El Watan calling the judges ``incapable.'' It
was not immediately clear to what extent the strike was being
observed in other towns.
	   The judges joined university teachers who walked off the job
Oct. 17 seeking salary increases and housing.
	   In addition, seven privately-owned newspapers failed to publish
for a tenth day Monday. They were protesting an ultimatum delivered
by state-owned printers to four of the papers demanding they pay
back debts or not be printed.
	   The National Journalists' Union, protesting what it said was an
attack on freedom of expression, called a sympathy strike for
Tuesday.
	   Omar Belhouchet, executive editor of El Watan, one of the four
papers in question, said the move was ``more political than
commercial'' -- the upshot of articles that led to the resignations
of Algeria's justice minister and President Zeroual's top aide.
	   Those articles were printed mainly by El Watin and Le Matin. The
newspapers carried on a five-month campaign against Mohamed
Betchine, a retired general who served as Zeroual's right-hand man.
The papers accused him of abuse of power. He resigned a week ago, a
day after the resignation of Justice Minister Mohamed Adami.
	   El Watan had published an article written by a group of judges
accusing Adami of dissolute morals, among other things.

Sampras under pressure as others close the gap on No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ With less than a month remaining
before the season-ending World Championship, the battle for No. 1
in men's tennis is heating up and several players have a chance of
dethroning Pete Sampras.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row. He now shares the record of five with Jimmy
Connors.
	   But as the crowded tennis schedule draws to a close, Sampras'
rule is under siege. Even Andre Agassi, who was ranked No. 140 at
this time last year, is still in contention to reclaim the No. 1.
	   Although he won Wimbledon for the fifth time this summer,
Sampras has had a mediocre year, at least by his standards. He won
only four titles and no other Grand Slams apart from Wimbledon.
	   Securing the No. 1 for the sixth year in a row is now Sampras'
goal.
	   ``It's a very important goal that I'm trying to achieve,''
Sampras said before the dlrs 2.45 million Eurocard Open, which
started Monday in Stuttgart.
	   ``So, I'll do whatever I have to do to make it. If it means
being away from home for five weeks, so be it,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have a chance to make it, and that's really all I can ask
for. It's up to me now.
	   ``I can't really expect the other players to lose. It's
definitely important, and it's something that might never be
achieved again,'' Sampras said.
	   The next couple of weeks will be decisive in the battle for No.
1.
	   The main challenge to Sampras comes from No. 2 Marcelo Rios, who
leads the tour with seven titles this years, and No. 2 Patrick
Rafter, who won his second consecutive U.S. Open title in
September.
	   Sampras and Rios both come to Stuttgart nursing injuries after
dropping out of the event in Lyon last week, Sampras with a back
strain, Rios with left-leg hamstring injury.
	   Like all top eight seeds in Stuttgart, Sampras and Rios have
first-round byes.
	   But even Agassi and seven other players still have at least a
mathematical chance of clinching the No. 1 spot. One of them is
Carlos Moya, the fourth-ranked French Open champion.
	   Agassi has shot to No. 5 after his victory Sunday in Ostrava,
the Czech Republic. It was his fifth title of the year and a
tour-high 10th final of the season.
	   He also leads the tour with 65 match victories this year and his
record stands at 65-15. At this time last year, he was 12-12 and
playing challenger tournaments in an attempt to fight back into the
top ranks after what had looked like a career-threatening slump.
	   With his victory in Ostrava, Agassi has qualified for the
eight-man field at next month's World Championship in Hanover,
Germany.
	   Alex Corretja became the sixth player to qualify by winning the
tournament in Lyon on Sunday.

Netanyahu says he won't apologize for playing Pollard card.

in graf 5 that Pollard was granted citizenship in 1996 &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
that he will not apologize for pushing for the release of Israeli
spy Jonathan Pollard from a U.S. prison in the final moments of
last week's Mideast summit.
	   Netanyahu was harshly attacked in Israel for linking the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians to the release of
Pollard, a move that delayed the festive signing for several hours
and reportedly infuriated Clinton administration officials.
	   Asked to comment on those reports, Netanyahu told Israel army
radio Monday: ``Not only will I not apologize. I am proud that I
stand up for him (Pollard) and I will continue to do so.''
	   Netanyahu said he was confident he will eventually win the
release of Pollard, who has been serving a life sentence in the
U.S. for spying for Israel. He handed classified U.S. military
documents to Israel.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst who was
granted Israeli citizenship by Netanyahu's administration in 1996,
has been in prison since 1985. Previous governments had sought to
distance themselves from Pollard.
	   Netanyahu said Israel had a moral obligation to try and get
Pollard released.
	   ``The man worked for us and our security,'' Netanyahu said. ``He
made a mistake. He should not have done what he did and Israel made
a mistake by doing what it did against the United States. But he
has been paying the price for 13 years and we need to get him out
of there.''
	   But Pollard sharply criticized Netanyahu, saying that leaks to
the press claiming he would be released were a deliberate attempt
``to blind the Israeli people to the government's on-going betrayal
of one of its agents,'' and that Netanyahu's stance on security was
hypocritical.
	   ``You cannot sit with the Americans and pretend to be a guardian
of Israel's security while you sit back and let one of your own
agents rot in their hands,'' Pollard told Israel radio Sunday.
	   Netanyahu has denied press reports that he sprung the Pollard
card on Clinton during the last day of summit negotiations. He said
he pushed for Pollard's release throughout the talks.
	   In the end, Clinton promised to review the Pollard case, but
emphasized he was making no promises regarding the outcome.
	   Netanyahu said this in itself was an achievement.
	   ``I heard the response of President Clinton who for the first
time said that he would look into the matter seriously. This is
something no president has ever said before.''

	   BERLIN (AP) _ An apparently deranged man grabbed a 3-year-old
child from his mother in a Berlin subway station and held a knife
to the boy's chest Monday, demanding a plane ticket to fly to home,
police said.
	   Police said the kidnapping took place about noon at the
Kottbusser Tor station in the Kreuzberg district; all streets and
subway exits in the area were closed off.
	   A witness said the mother fell to her knees pleading with the
kidnapper to give her child back, but was ignored. She was being
cared for by police psychologists along with her husband.
	   Police were still negotiating with the Arabic-speaking kidnapper
several hours later. He apparently wanted to go to Algeria,
although police described his demands as vague.

Geneva judge issues arrest order for former Chilean leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Spanish request for assistance, last graf &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities on Monday also requested
the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being
held in Britain on an arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The move follows a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva
by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double
nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the Chilean secret police.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   That request has been passed on to Swiss federal authorities,
who will decide whether to pass it on to British authorities.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
his arrest earlier this month. The arrest came at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule that ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, including Spaniards, but
could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared. Jaccard's was one of the names on the list.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Bertossa added that the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet
should be given priority. A Spanish request for legal assistance
from Switzerland was made Friday, but no details have been
released.

Jordan, Israel mark peace treaty by launching water project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADASIYA, Jordan (AP) _ Israel and Jordan marked the fourth
anniversary of their peace treaty Monday with a ceremony to begin
construction of a dam that will regulate the flow of water from a
river that flows along the border.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Jordanian Water
Minister Hani Mulqi attended a brief ceremony at the site.
	   ``The project is one of the fruits of the 1994 peace treaty,''
Mulqi said in Adasiya, 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the
capital, Amman.
	   The dlrs 2.32 million dam, which Jordan is financing, will boost
the flow of water from the Yarmouk River into the parched Arab
kingdom and will ensure that Jordan receives its share of water as
agreed to in the peace treaty.
	   The dam is expected to be completed within nine months. It will
replace sandbags which have long served to dam the river, which is
shared by Syria, Jordan and Israel.
	   The project also includes a 60-meter-long (60-yard-long) weir
which will divert the river's overflow into the King Abdullah
Canal, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Amman. The canal
provides drinking water to the capital and to the Jordan Valley,
the country's breadbasket.
	   The dam will provide Jordan with 20 million cubic meters (700
million cubic feet) of water annually from the Yarmouk River _ the
same level of water that Israel has been pumping to Jordan since
shortly after the peace treaty.
	   Israel also provides Jordan with another 140 million cubic
meters (4.9 billion cubic feet) of water each year from the Yarmouk
River. But that water is stored in Israel's Lake Tiberius because
the kingdom lacks sufficient storage area.

<TEXT>
	   WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Former lawmaker Nicholas Budgen, a
leading opponent of the European Union in Britain's Conservative
Party, died Monday of liver cancer, the party announced. He was 60.
	   Budgen, who represented the central England district of
Wolverhampton, was elected to the House of Commons in 1974. He lost
his seat in May 1997 elections, a casualty of the Labor Party's
landslide victory.
	   He was prominent among so-called Euroskeptics who harassed
ex-Prime Minister John Major by trying to block any further British
integration into Europe.
	   A lawyer, he was educated at Cambridge.
	   Budgen was diagnosed with liver cancer in August, said David
Chambers, Conservative Party spokesman in Wolverhampton.
	   Budgen is survived by his wife, Madelaine, a son and a daughter.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Gascoigne out of rehab, promises no more drinking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Troubled midfielder Paul Gascoigne
rejoined Middlesbrough on Monday, just 16 days after checking into
a clinic for treatment of stress, depression and alcohol problems.
	   Appearing at a news conference alongside manager Bryan Robson,
the former England star said he would stop drinking and try to cope
better with the off-the-field pressures that have burdened him
throughout his career.
	   The 31-year-old ``Gazza,'' one of the most scrutinized
personalities in Britain, was admitted to the rehabilitation clinic
after a series of drunken incidents that were widely reported in
British newspapers.
	   ``It wasn't just the drinking,'' he said Monday. ``It was
everything. Depressed. Stress. ... I thought it would be in the
best interest that I get away. I went to the hospital where I could
sort everything out. I feel better for it.''
	   Asked whether the treatment included admitting he was an
alcoholic, Gascoigne said, ``I'm not going to go into that.''
	   But he did say, ``I have decided to stop drinking. It is
important to keep off the drink.''
	   Asked whether he was a changed man, he said, ``I'll let you
decide that.''
	   When Gascoigne was admitted to the clinic, there was speculation
he could be in treatment for up to six months. Many were surprised
that he was returning to the club after just two weeks.
	   But Robson said the doctors who treated Gascoigne felt he was
ready to rejoin the club while continuing his treatment.
	   Robson said Gascoigne would return to the hospital ``a couple of
days a week'' for ongoing treatment for the next month.
	   ``The medical people are delighted with the intense work he put
in,'' Robson said. ``They said he was an excellent patient, and has
come on in leaps and bounds.''
	   Robson said Gascoigne trained with the club Monday morning and
``looked good.''
	   The manager said he would assess Gazza's fitness during the week
and would consider using him in Sunday's Premier League game
against Nottingham Forest.
	   Gascoigne, who said he kept fit during his hospital stay by
playing in five-a-side games, denied that he had been ``led
astray'' by his entourage of night-clubbing, celebrity friends.
	   ``I just thought I was going onto the pitch with a lot of
problems I should have coped with better,'' he said.
	   Gazza thanked Robson for his support as well as Paul Merson, the
Aston Villa and former Middlesbrough midfielder who underwent
treatment for alcoholism.
	   Robson said Gascoigne was free to choose his own friends but
should learn to handle himself better and not be influenced by
others.
	   ``He is going to have to change his lifestyle to a certain
extent,'' Robson said. ``But that doesn't mean he can't enjoy
himself.''
	   Gascoigne fended off questions about his future with the England
team, saying he was only concentrating on getting back into the
'Boro lineup. He also declined to comment on England coach Glenn
Hoddle, who dropped him from the team on the eve of last summer's
World Cup for being ``unfit.''
	   His axing followed reports of his drunken behavior in nightclubs
in England and Spain in the leadup to tournament.
	   In his World Cup diary, Hoddle said Gascoigne went beserk and
smashed up a hotel room when he was given the news of his axing.
	   In the meantime, one of the player's closest friends died after
a night out with Gascoigne and his stormy two-year marriage ended
when his wife Sheryl was granted a ``quickie'' divorce on the
grounds of what was described as his unreasonable behavior.

Anti-European ex-lawmaker Nicholas Budgen dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Former lawmaker Nicholas Budgen, a
leading Conservative Party opponent of the European Union, died
Monday of liver cancer, the party announced. He was 60.
	   Budgen, who represented the central England district of
Wolverhampton, was elected to the House of Commons in 1974. He lost
his seat in May 1997 elections, a casualty of the Labor Party's
landslide victory.
	   He was prominent among so-called Euroskeptics who harassed
ex-Prime Minister John Major by trying to block any further British
integration into Europe.
	   Budgen, a Cambridge-educated lawyer, was diagnosed with liver
cancer in August, said David Chambers, Conservative Party spokesman
in Wolverhampton.
	   Budgen is survived by his wife, Madelaine, a son and a daughter.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Vietnamese bishops to invite pope to visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Roman Catholic bishops of Vietnam have
asked their government to invite Pope John Paul II to visit next
summer, the Vatican's missionary news service, Fides, reported
Monday.
	   It said the bishops would like the pope to help celebrate the
anniversary of an apparation of the Virgin Mary in the tiny village
of La Vang.
	   Tens of thousands of people attended the three-day festival this
year marking the 200th anniversary of the apparition, the only one
recorded in southeast Asia. The festival was seen as a test of the
Communist government's promise of freedom of religion.
	   Only officially recognized religions are permitted in Vietnam
and they must operate under government rules.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, but an estimated 8
million of its 78 million people are Roman Catholics.
	   Vietnam's government does not have diplomatic relations with the
Vatican and their relations have long been strained over government
controls on religion.
	   There have been signs, however, that the government would like
to improve relations. In March, it approved the Vatican's
appointment of a new archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City.
	   The position had been vacant for more than three years after the
government rejected the first nomination.

Future German foreign minister to mix continuity with new action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's new leftist government will seek
continuity in foreign policy but also put more stress human rights
and economic development, the Greens foreign minister-to-be said in
an interview published Monday.
	   ``There is no green foreign policy, but a German foreign
policy,'' Greens leader Joschka Fischer told the leftist daily
Liberation.
	   Europe's most economically powerful and populous nation will
continue to support European unification, the euro single currency,
European Union expansion eastward and EU reform, he said.
	   ``But we will add new accents: the human rights question,
durable development, the democratization of Europe, the relaunch of
disarmament,'' the 50-year-old leader said.
	   ``I also hope that with our partners we can definitively put an
end to wars in ex-Yugoslavia,'' Fischer said.
	   Following the footsteps of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder,
Fischer was to make his first foreign trip Wednesday to France, a
day after he and the rest of the new government were to take
office.
	   The trip underlines the ultimate importance of the Franco-German
axis in building the 15-nation EU. ``I hope it will be
revitalized,'' he said of the axis.
	   The future foreign minister said the euro will provide ``a
strong factor of acceleration'' toward common European economic,
financial and social policies. ``I don't think it will remain a
vague confederation.''
	   Fischer went so far as to call the euro ``a European
revolution,'' noting it was the first common currency since Roman
times. ``I hope that Great Britain will soon decide to join the
euro.''
	   Germans above all ``must be Europeans,'' said the former radical
street protester during the '60s and '70s. ``There is no other
solution. We can't act as if we had no past, or define our
interests nationally.''
	   Fischer added he hoped a European sense of consciousness would
develop, that public opinion ``will begin to form at the European
level, as it does at at the national level.''

New German parliament opens with left in control

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A month after Germany's left swept to power
in elections, the new parliament opened Monday with an appeal to
fight mass unemployment and build a society more tolerant of
foreigners.
	   ``This parliament will have to be judged on whether it succeeds
in creating more social justice,'' said Fred Gebhardt, 70, who held
the opening speech as the oldest lawmaker.
	   With the government moving back to the prewar capital, Berlin,
next year, he also pleaded with his colleagues to resist ``national
megalomania'' and to fight racism and anti-Semitism in Germany.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, due to be formally elected
by parliament Tuesday, has promised an agenda for change,
especially in domestic policy.
	   With the Social Democrats and ecology-minded Greens jointly
running the country for the first time, both parties have pledged
to buttress the social welfare state while promising continuity in
foreign policy.
	   Their program includes pledges to phase out nuclear power, tax
relief for people with average incomes, and allowing more
foreigners to become German citizens _ projects that were blocked
or unthinkable under Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right
government.
	   ``We have a long road before us,'' Schroeder said before the
session.
	   Later Monday, parliament was expected to elect its first
president from former communist East Germany. Wolfgang Thierse, a
55-year-old Social Democrat, was active in the democracy movement
that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989.
	   Kohl, who united Germany in 1990, received a medal Monday from
President Roman Herzog honoring his ``service to Germany and
Europe.'' Only one other chancellor, postwar leader Konrad
Adenauer, has previously received the special order of merit.
	   Schroeder, 54, will lead the nation through historic changes:
not only the government's return to Berlin, but also the Jan. 1
debut of Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   Parliament also looks different: About a quarter of the 669
lawmakers are new and a record number _ 207 _ are women. Carsten
Schneider, a 22-year-old Social Democrat, is parliament's youngest
member ever.
	   Amid the changes, Gebhardt reminded his colleagues of Germany's
past, recalling that his family was persecuted by the Nazis.
	   Gebhardt's grandfather, a Social Democratic lawmaker during the
1920s, was shot by the Nazis at the end of World War II. Gebhardt
was elected on the ticket of the former East German communists.
	   Social Democrats and Greens, who have a comfortable 21-seat
majority, cleared the way for the new administration by approving
their coalition pact at weekend conventions.
	   For the new parliament, the ex-communists have a right to name a
vice president for the first time after increasing their share of
the vote above a 5-percent benchmark on Sept. 27. Each party that
clears the hurdle is granted the post in formal recognition of
influence.
	   Conservative opponents have vowed to challenge Petra Blaess'
nomination, but her approval seemed likely after Social Democrats
and Greens said Sunday they would back her.

Soccer players out of hospital after lightning incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Two soccer players were
released from a hospital on Monday, a day after they were felled by
lightning during a game.
	   In all, six players of the Moroka Swallows, a local team, were
hurt when lightning hit the playing field during a thunderstorm
Sunday.
	   Four of them were slightly injured and didn't require an
overnight hospital stay. The other two were released from the
hospital on Monday, said Premier Soccer League spokesman Andrew
Dipela.
	   None of the players was directly hit, said emergency services
deputy chief Charles Terre Blanche.
	   ``They received an electrical shock from the ground,'' Terre
Blanche said.
	   It happened in the 79th minute during a match between Jomo
Cosmos and the Moroka Swallows. The game was called off, with the
Swallows leading 2-0.

Centrist coalition formed to support Luzhkov for president

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A group of moderate political parties formed an
alliance Monday to support Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov for Russian
president in the next elections.
	   ``Yuri Luzhkov would be the best candidate,'' said Ret. Gen.
Andrei Nikolayev, the member of the Russian parliament who leads
the recently created Union of the Power of the People and Labor
party.
	   Luzhkov enjoys broad popularity in the Russian capital, whose
residents credit him with a construction boom in recent years.
However, he has limited support in the far-flung Russian provinces,
where people often resent relatively wealthy Moscow.
	   Luzhkov, who has said he might run for president, has been
barnstorming in the hinterland in recent weeks to advertise his
platform.
	   Nikolayev, the former head of Russia's border guard service and
a longtime Luzhkov ally, is trying to broaden the mayor's support
base by forming a coalition of centrist forces to take part in 1999
parliamentary elections and name Luzhkov as its candidate for the
2000 presidential race.
	   While Luzhkov has not endorsed the new party, he echoed
Nikolayev's aims in a separate meeting with reporters Monday. ``If
we want to consolidate the society, we should move toward
centrism,'' the mayor said.
	   None of the parties in the new coalition, however, can boast
significant membership or political influence. Many took part _ and
lost _ in the latest parliamentary elections in 1995.
	   Nikolayev insisted the new alliance would be able to rapidly
expand its clout, catering to the majority of Russians who dislike
the more radical parties dominating the political spectrum.
	   Yeltsin has appeared increasingly weak, raising doubts about his
ability to govern. On Monday, doctors banned the president from
going to Vienna tomorrow because of extreme fatigue. Yeltsin has
insisted he had no serious illnesses and would serve out his term.
	   At least one prominent presidential hopeful, liberal lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky, hasn't joined in calls for Yeltsin's early
resignation.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, who finished fourth in the 1996 presidential
elections and recently had a mild heart attack, said in a
television interview on Sunday night that he was confident of
winning the presidency and wouldn't join any coalition.
	   A nationwide poll of 1,500 people conducted on Oct. 17-18 showed
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov had the support of 20 percent of
respondents, while Luzhkov had 17 percent and Krasnoyarsk governor
Alexander Lebed had 14 percent.
	   Yavlinsky had the support of 8 percent of respondents in the
poll conducted by the respected Public Opinion Foundation. The
Russian NTV television, which carried the poll, didn't give its
margin of error.

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, drumming
up support for the new Middle East peace accord, said Monday
Israel's pledge for further withdrawals from the West Bank was of
``major importance.''
	   In a statement relayed by the official Palestinian news agency
WAFA, Arafat said the deal signed in Washington Friday was struck
with ``people who previously did not recognize the existence of a
Palestinian land.''
	   ``We can say that the Palestinians have obtained results we
didn't expect to get from this (Israeli) government which since
taking office has been against peace and the restoration of land,''
the statement continued.
	   The president of the Palestinian Authority arrived in Tunis
Sunday night as part of a tour to discuss the accord brokered by
U.S. President Bill Clinton during nine days of intense
negotiations.
	   Arafat met Monday with Tunisian leader President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali.
	   Palestinian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Arafat emphasized during the talks that the accord was a step in
the right direction, while acknowledging that it did not meet all
the Palestinians' demands.
	   Arafat, who on Sunday traveled to Egypt, Algeria and Morocco,
left later Monday for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
	   In Cairo on Sunday, Arafat said he hoped the new
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be ``accurately and
faithfully'' implemented.
	   His comment reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to withdraw from a
further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   The agreement calls for Arafat to clamp stringent security
measures on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in
exchange for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo's roads Monday while the government tried to convince
NATO it is meeting the deadline to reduce troops in the breakaway
province or face airstrikes.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark,
briefed alliance ambassadors on weekend talks in Belgrade in which
he pressed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for further troop
withdrawals from Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian militants are
fighting for independence
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic had agreed ``in very detailed terms'' to withdraw his
forces by Tuesday _ NATO's deadline for Milosevic to comply with a
Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis without airstrikes.
	   The government's Serb Media Center said three military units
were returning to their barracks in the towns of Urosevac, Pristina
and Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   Later, a convoy of more than two dozen Yugoslav tanks, trucks
and other armored vehicles was seen rolling through the Komorane
checkpoint toward Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb
forces shelled four villages Monday in the Klina area 50 kilometers
(30 miles) west of here. The center said the same villages were
shelled Sunday evening for an hour and a half.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. The province's
ethnic Albanian leadership has been urging NATO to carry out the
airstrikes.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return to their homes. Hundreds
of people have died since Milosevic launched his crackdown in
February in the province, part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   Some 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Luxembourg, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said if the
Serbs follow through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops,
``that will certainly be a significant advance. But we want to see
the evidence first.''
	   NATO's ``planes are still on the runway,'' ready for airstrikes,
Cook said. ``If Milosevic does not want them to take off, then it
is up to him to comply. He knows what he has got to do.''
	   In Brussels, the NATO official said intelligence reports confirm
``some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal.''
	   Still, he said, NATO remains resolved to use military force once
a deadline on withdrawal runs out at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) Tuesday.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with the
orders. Ethnic Albanian refugees, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass civilians.
	   International officials fear a humanitarian disaster if Kosovo
Albanian refugees do not feel safe enough to return to their homes
before winter.
	   A planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived Monday in
the capital of Montenegro, the tiny republic that comprises
Yugoslavia along with Serbia. More than 40,000 Kosovo Albanians
have fled to Montenegro since Milosevic's February crackdown.
	   The dlrs 117,000 worth of blankets, antibiotics and other
medicine _ for about 40,000 people _ was the first direct shipment
of international humanitarian aid for tens of thousands of refugees
forced from their homes by fighting in Kosovo.
	   On Sunday, mourners near Pristina dived for cover when gunfire
whistled overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence would not protect
the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind the mountain village of
Krajkova, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina.
	   His father, Rashit Elshani, blamed Serb police, saying his son
died simply because he was Albanian. Police have been shooting in
the area every night to try to scare off villagers, he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Two soccer players were
released from a hospital on Monday, a day after they were felled by
lightning during a game.
	   In all, six players of the Moroka Swallows, a local team, were
hurt when lightning hit the playing field during a thunderstorm
Sunday.
	   Four of them were slightly injured and didn't require an
overnight hospital stay. The other two were released from the
hospital on Monday, said Premier Soccer League spokesman Andrew
Dipela.
	   None of the players was directly hit, said emergency services
deputy chief Charles Terre Blanche.
	   ``They received an electrical shock from the ground,'' Terre
Blanche said.
	   It happened in the 79th minute during a match between Jomo
Cosmos and the Moroka Swallows. The game was called off, with the
Swallows leading 2-0.

NATO-led peacekeeping maneuvers begin in Ukraine

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ships and marines from 12 countries filled
Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa on Monday for the official
opening of the NATO-led peacekeeping exercise Sea Breeze '98.
	   Ukrainian Navy commander Mykhailo Yezhel and senior military
officials from other participating nations hailed the maneuvers as
a peaceful way to help prepare for joint peacekeeping operations.
	   The exercise, which drew only five countries the first time it
was held in 1997, this time brought together military units from
Ukraine, the United States, Russia, Bulgaria, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Greece, Georgia, Italy, Romania and Turkey.
	   Russia, which refused to participate in last year's Sea Breeze,
contributed two ships and 30 marines to the maneuvers, its first
joint exercise with the Ukrainian and U.S. navies.
	   The exercise, organized by Ukraine and the United States under
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, is a simulation of an
international force assembled by the United Nations to assist an
imaginary coastal republic devastated by an earthquake.
	   About 4,500 participants with 28 ships and more than 30 aircraft
are to deliver humanitarian aid, evacuate sick and injured citizens
and enforce an embargo to prevent illegal weapons supplies.
	   The exercise has enraged Ukrainian leftists, who are sharply
opposed to their country's active ties with NATO. On Friday,
Ukraine's Communists and their allies who dominate parliament tried
to ban Sea Breeze, but fell two dozen votes short of approving the
motion.
	   Last year's Sea Breeze drew sharp protests from Russia and
hundreds of angry demonstrators on the mostly Russian-populated
Crimean Peninsula.
	   Moscow criticized last year's exercise because its original
scenario spoke of preventing ethnic unrest in Crimea, which Russia
saw as an allusion to the peninsula's ethnic Russian separatists
wanting Crimea to become part of Russia instead of Ukraine.

<SLUG> U.N. withdraws pilot Iraq accused of spying </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations withdrew a Chilean pilot
from Iraq on Monday after Baghdad accused the member of the U.N.
inspection team of espionage, the chief arms monitor in Baghdad
said.
	   The Chilean helicopter pilot is the second member of the U.N.
inspection commission to be withdrawn during the past two weeks.
	   The pilot, who was not identified, left Iraq for Bahrain, said
Nils Carlstrom, head of the U.N. monitoring office in Baghdad.
	   The pilot used his own camera to photograph sensitive material,
a breach of rules set by the U.N. commission, which is working to
verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq accused the pilot of spying and the U.N. commission agreed
to his withdrawal.
	   Earlier, the U.N. weapons monitors withdrew Carl Pfluger, an
American, who was found using his own camera to photograph missile
warheads.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors rely on five Chilean helicopters and 40
crew members for surveillance of weapons sites in Iraq.
	   Iraq has repeatedly accused the weapons inspectors of espionage
and since Aug. 5 has blocked surprise inspections by the experts.
	   Under U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after the 1991
Gulf War, Iraq must show it has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the world body will lift trade sanctions imposed
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Police disperse jobless college grads outside Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rights group comment

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Riot police charged hundreds of unemployed
college graduates who defied a protest ban and gathered outside
Parliament Monday to press their demand for jobs.
	   About 300 protesters were outside Parliament when police charged
into the crowd to disperse it. Official sources said six people
were injured and a dozen arrested, though a youth leader claimed
dozens were hurt and more than 60 people were rounded up.
	   The demonstrators went on to the regional government prefecture,
then to the local Moroccan Labor Union headquarters, where hundreds
gathered inside despite efforts by police to block them.
	   Nearly 1,000 of police were deployed in central Rabat to prevent
further unrest. During the Parliament protest, police roughed up
journalists for several foreign and domestic media and seized their
film.
	   The youth leader, Ahmed Kabil, assistant secretary-general of
the Association of Young Unemployed Graduates, said police arrested
the group's leader, Faber Bensaid, outside the local government
prefecture.
	   Police had banned a march planned by the group, so leaders
instead ``wanted to turn it into a sit-in in front of the
Parliament,'' Kabil said.
	   The Moroccan Association for the Defense of Human Rights, in a
statement Monday, said it ``condemns the attacks and demands that a
report be made by officials.''
	   Moroccan students and graduates have periodically staged
protests demanding more aid for training and job placement.

Freed soldiers meet relatives and friends

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Six soldiers, released by Tamil Tiger
rebels in northern Sri Lanka over the weekend, met their families
and friends on Monday after spending several years in captivity.
	   For the first time ever, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
set free the soldiers and three civilian sailors Saturday. They
gave no reason for the release and haven't made any demands from
the government so far.
	   ``I'm so happy to be back with my family,'' said Palitha
Pushpakumara, a 29-year-old soldier who had been captured by the
rebels in 1993.
	   ``I never thought they'll release us,'' he said. Pushpakumara
said he had been kept in chains for five years but his family was
able to send him some clothes through the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
	   There has never been a formal exchange of prisoners of war
between the Tamil Tiger rebels and the government.
	   ``I can't understand why they actually released us,'' said
31-year-old Palitha Samath, who was captured in 1993.
	   ``Possibly they want the government to release some prisoners of
war as well,'' he said.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east,
claiming that they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese who control the government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

Jordan, Israel mark peace treaty by launching water project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADASIYA, Jordan (AP) _ Israel and Jordan marked the fourth
anniversary of their peace treaty Monday with a ceremony to begin
construction of a dam that will regulate the flow of water from a
border river.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Jordanian Water
Minister Hani Mulqi attended a brief ceremony at the site.
	   ``The project is one of the fruits of the 1994 peace treaty,''
Mulqi said in Adasiya, 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the
capital, Amman.
	   The dlrs 2.32 million dam, which Jordan is financing, will boost
the flow of water from the Yarmouk River into the parched Arab
kingdom and will ensure that Jordan receives its share of water
under the treaty.
	   The dam is expected to be completed in nine months. It will
replace sandbags that have long served to dam the river, which is
shared by Syria, Jordan and Israel.
	   The dam will provide Jordan with 20 million cubic meters (700
million cubic feet) of water annually from the Yarmouk River.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his body was dumped in downtown Hebron Monday in what
appeared to be an attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking.
	   The last such killing was in August when a member of the Islamic
militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. After driving for several years, they
saw a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   The victim was a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba.

English player wins suit over broken leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ A First Division soccer player on Monday
won his suit for negligence against an opponent who broke his leg
with a lunging tackle.
	   Bradford City striker Gordon Watson succeeded in his High Court
action in Leeds against Huddersfield Town defender Kevin Gray and
Huddersfield Town.
	   Justice Anthony Hooper, who issued the ruling after a five-day
trial, said he would give his reasons for the verdict Thursday. The
amount of damages will be decided next year.
	   The judge, however, ruled against Bradford City, which also sued
Gray and Huddersfield Town for recklessness.
	   Watson suffered a career-threatening double fracture of his
right leg when Gray lunged at him with both feet during a game on
Feb. 1, 1997.
	   Watson, 27, missed the rest of that season and the entire
1997-98 campaign. He has undergone five operations and had a
six-inch metal plate inserted in leg.
	   Watson said he still has a long way to go to get back to full
match fitness.
	   ``I'm only half the player I was, but a year ago I didn't think
I would ever play football again,'' he said. ``I just hope that
this might deter that type of challenge. You don't want anyone to
go through what I've been through, whether it's a professional
footballer, a kid on a Sunday or someone playing in the park.''
	   During the trial, BBC television soccer analyst Jimmy Hill
described the tackle as the worst he had ever seen.
	   ``The challenge by Kevin Gray was clearly reckless and wild,''
he told the court. ``It was appalling and unacceptable.''
	   Gray and Huddersfield had both denied liability for Watson's
injury, claiming it was purely accidental.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Forty-four foreigners, who had illegally
crossed the Greek border into Albania, were detained Sunday as they
were waiting to be smuggled to Italy, Interior Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga said Monday.
	   The refugees, including eights Kurds, five Pakistanis and 31
Iraqis, were hiding in a forest near the port of Vlora, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Tirana, when police detained them.
	   They had first tried to reach the Italian coast on Saturday
night but headed back after noticing the Italian coastguard, Bizha
said.
	   The waters off Vlora were the site of a fatal incident on
Saturday night when a dinghy carrying 25 Albanian refugees collided
with another small boat, exploded and sank. Six people were killed.
	   Bizhga said that all the foreign citizens detained Sunday,
including seven women and two children, were being sent back to the
Kakavia checkpoint on the Albanian-Greek border on Monday in order
to be handed over to Greek authorities.
	   There is constant traffic across the Adriatic from Albania to
Italy, a favorite destination for Albanians fleeing their troubled
Balkan homeland.

Parliament hardliners begin process of holding early elections

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost the
first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli security
guard was shot in the neck and his body was dumped in a street in
an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over a
12-week period, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
The suggested date for the elections was March 16.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hardliners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down the prime minister.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by a special
majority of 60 of the 120 legislators. Supporters of the bill said
they were confident they could pass the legislation.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace
agreement.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet and to be voted on later Monday.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli security guard in Hebron
raised new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal
can withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. Moments later, they saw a body lying on

	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car sped away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron. The missing tennis shoe was found
in the car.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim. They said he had been shot three times
in the neck, chest and hand.
	   The victim worked as a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat

Opel names new chairman amid signs of tension with GM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background; quotes from news conf. and
union &QL; 
 &UR; By CARSTEN HERZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., Adam Opel AG, named new top bosses Monday to resolve
a boardroom crisis caused by the abrupt recall of its chairman to
Detroit.
	   Robert Hendry, head of GM's Swedish Saab division, will replace
Gary Cowger as chairman of the management board on Nov. 1, Opel
said. Opel personnel chief Wolfgang Strinz was named Hendry's
deputy.
	   The arrangement was seen as a face-saving compromise for GM and
its German managers at Opel, which has suffered from declining
profits and market share in recent years.
	   Union leaders had complained the management turmoil of recent
weeks was only hurting the company's image further.
	   ``We have to have an end to the chaos,'' said Rudi Mueller,
chairman of the Opel works council at the main Ruesselsheim plant.
``We want to produce cars again instead of headlines.''
	   The bickering goes back to June, when GM installed Cowger as
chairman of Opel's management board over much German resistance.
Then last week it suddenly decided to recall him to Detroit to head
GM's troubled U.S. labor relations.
	   On Saturday, in a surprise move seen as another sign of
worsening relations, Hans Wilhelm Gaeb resigned as supervisory
board chairman after almost 18 years in office.
	   An Opel statement said only that Gaeb's resignation was due to
differing perceptions of the company's business strategies.
	   GM had sought to replace Cowger with Peter Hanenberger, the
European product development chief, but German unions opposed
naming him, because they blamed him for quality problems at Opel in
recent years.
	   Opel's German board, which had to approve the chairman, is
evenly divided between labor and management representatives.
	   With Hendry, GM maintains an American at the top of Opel, while
Strinz becomes the highest-ranking German at the company.
	   Seeking to improve its global performance, GM recently announced
plans to merge its two big, independent automotive units for North
America and the rest of the world into one. The new boss is an
American, G. Richard Wagoner Jr.
	   At an extraordinary meeting Monday, the supervisory board tapped
Hans Barth, vice president in charge of project and production
support for GM Europe, to take over for Gaeb, effective
immediately.
	   At a news conference, Barth said GM and the Opel team had
settled all disputed questions over the past few days.
	   Hendry will retain his title at Saab, while spending most of his
time at Opel, Barth said. A deputy will be named at Saab to handle
the daily work there.
	   Opel also chose Michael Burns, head of GM's European Operations
in Zurich, Switzerland, to join the board to fill Gaeb's vacancy.

Christie's may cancel auction of Archimedes manuscript

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An ownership challenge over the only known
copy of a text by ancient Greek scientist Archimedes could result
in the cancellation of its auction this week, a representative for
the Christie's auction house said Monday.
	   ``Christie's are not at all sure that we will go on with the
sale,'' said Felix de Marez Oyens, head of the auction house's
Books and Manuscripts Department. The auction is scheduled for
Thursday in New York.
	   The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem claimed last week
to be the 1,000-year-old manuscript's rightful owner, saying the
text was stolen from its library in Constantinople _ present-day
Istanbul _ earlier this century.
	   The library's collection was moved to Athens after World War I.
Centuries earlier, it was held in monasteries in the Middle East.
	   Christie's insists it is satisfied the manuscript's current
holders _ a French family who obtained it in the 1920s _ and are
entitled to sell it.
	   But the auction house fears publicity surrounding the ownership
question could lower the manuscript's price. The 174-leaf text was
originally expected to sell for between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2
million.
	   It is the only known copy of original notes and calculations by
the 3rd century BC theoretician and inventor, who explored the
movements of the stars and is credited with devising the compound
pulley and devices for raising water.
	   ``Of course we are concerned, and the consignor is concerned,''
de Marez Oyens said. ``If we are allowed to hold the sale and the
(Patriarchate's) claim is unsuccessful _ as we think it will be _
we may still decide together with the consignor not to have the
sale.''
	   The Patriarchate, through its lawyer in New York, has threatened
legal action if the manuscript is not voluntarily given up. If
returned, the Patriarchate would hand the text over to Athens'
National Library, Greek officials said.
	   ``The claim of the Patriarchate appears to us, at best, to be a
belated renunciation of actions taken by their own representatives
in Constantinople many decades ago, in circumstances where
apparently no detailed records were kept,'' de Marez Oyens said in
a statement.
	   It is possible, he said, that the French family might withdraw
the manuscript from sale consideration.
	   Many Greeks see the text as part of their cultural heritage.
Officials had originally appealed to Greek institutions to pool
their funds to try to win the bidding.
	   Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos called the ``concealment''
of the manuscript ``a crime against the world scientific and
intellectual reserves.''
	   A final decision on the auction could be delayed as late as
Wednesday.
	   ``It would be a pity if it went back to its original private
ownership,'' de Marez Oyens added.
	   He said Christie's hopes the manuscript ``will either end up in
Greece or in a great national or university institution elsewhere
where it can be properly studied.''
	   But the controversy may leave them no choice. ``If circumstances
force us to do it and force the consignor to withdraw it, it will
be withdrawn,'' he added.

Aid groups urge Security Council to take bigger role in ending

Sudan war &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 2000 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Four aid organizations working in Sudan
urged the United Nations and the Security Council on Monday to take
a more active role in ending Sudan's civil war, which has killed an
estimated 1.5 million people.
	   CARE International, Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Save the
Children were meeting with Security Council members later Monday at
Sweden's U.N. mission to press their campaign.
	   The United Nations and the 15-member council have largely stayed
out of the political aspects of the war, focusing mainly on
humanitarian relief for Sudanese who are suffering from 15 years of
war coupled with devastating famines.
	   ``Humanitarian assistance alone, in a political vacuum, will not
solve Sudan's problems nor stop the next famine,'' said Guy
Tousignant, secretary general of CARE International. ``What we need
is political will to end the war.''
	   Specifically, the groups called for an expansion and extension
of a three-month cease-fire beyond the southern province of Bahr
el-Ghazal. They asked the United Nations to ``generate a forceful
and positive lobby for peace,'' while at the same time improving
the ability of the aid groups to reach famine-stricken people.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting the
Muslim government in the north since 1983 to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in battles and in famines
worsened by rebels or government-backed militias who burned or
stole crops needed by their enemies or civilians.
	   ``We need an effective peace process to de-escalate the
situation at every level across the region,'' said Mark Bowden, an
Africa regional director for Save the Children.

United Nations withdraws pilot Iraq accused of spying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations withdrew a Chilean
member of its weapons inspection team on Monday after he was
accused of espionage, the chief arms monitor in Baghdad said.
	   The Chilean helicopter pilot is the second member of the U.N.
team to be withdrawn during the past two weeks.
	   The pilot, who was not identified, left Iraq for Bahrain, said
Nils Carlstrom, head of the U.N. monitoring office in Baghdad.
	   The pilot used his own camera to photograph sensitive material,
a breach of rules set by the U.N. commission, which is working to
verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq accused the pilot of spying and the U.N. commission agreed
to his withdrawal.
	   Earlier, the U.N. weapons monitors withdrew Carl Pfluger, an
American, who was found using his own camera to photograph missile
warheads.
	   Chile has provided five helicopters and 40 crew members to the
inspection team for surveillance of weapons sites.
	   Since Aug. 5, Iraq has blocked surprise inspections by the
inspectors, repeatedly accusing them of being spies.
	   Iraq must show it has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction
before the United Nations will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Swedish social affairs minister steps down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Social Affairs Minister Anders
Sundstroem stepped down on Monday after less than a month on the
job to become head of a bank.
	   Sundstroem, 46, began his career in government as labor market
minister in 1994, then became trade minister in 1996. As trade
minister, he led the discussions that resulted in Sweden's
controversial decision last year to begin shutting down its nuclear
power plants.
	   In a Cabinet rearrangement following last month's national
elections, Sundstroem was named to replace Margot Wallstroem as
social affairs minister. The trade ministry was absorbed into a new
Growth Ministry.
	   Sundstroem will become head of Pitedalens Sparbank, a regional
bank in Sundstroem's native far-north Norbotten area.
	   He said he decided to resign because his main interests are in
regional and trade matters and that being head of the bank would
allow him to continue these interests.
	   Deputy Social Affairs Minister Maj-Inger Klingvall is to head
the department until a new minister is appointed.

Peace deal to cost Israel dlrs 250 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It will cost Israel an estimated dlrs 250
million to carry out the West Bank troop redeployment it committed
to under the latest Mideast peace deal, Israel radio reported
Monday.
	   Down from earlier estimates of dlrs 1 billion to fullfill
security arrangements in the agreement, the lower figure had a
better chance of being approved by the U.S. Congress.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged to provide Israel with a
security aid package as part of the agreement signed at the White
House last week.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon met with his staff Monday
to prepare for a meeting next week in Washington with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeline Albright to settle a figure package.
	   Most spending will cover additional security for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, according to the radio. Many
settlements will be left surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas
after the redeployment is completed.
	   Other costs include paving ten bypass roads for settlers and
evacuating ten military camps, the radio reported.
	   Israel already receives aboout dlrs 3 billion in economic and
military aid from the United States annually. Congress must approve
any new spending packages for Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said following the summit that he expects both himself
and Clinton to lobby lawmakers for the money.
	   ``I'm confident we'll achieve the necessary resources,'' he said
Sunday.
	   Israeli military and foreign ministry officials are now
assessing how much aid will be needed, Netanyahu's office said.

Russian cannot service foreign debt in 1999, government says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with government saying it will be unable to
pay foreign debts in 1999, new figures on revenue and spending,
indication of new money-printing; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Even if Russia figures out how to pay off this
year's debts, it won't be able to pay its foreign debts in 1999
unless it receives international aid, a top official said Monday.
	   Russia's government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt
in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it off, said Alexander
Zhukov, head of parliament's budget committee.
	   The announcement is more bad news for Russia, which is trying to
restructure this year's debt, frozen in August. Talks in London
with foreign banks broke down last week, but Zhukov insisted Russia
would find a way to pay off this year's debts.
	   That may prove difficult. Zhukov said revenues for the first
nine months of the year were 51 percent of targeted totals. He did
not provide exact figures.
	   The Interfax news agency had a higher estimate, saying revenues
from January through September totaled 191.3 billion rubles (dlrs
11.2 billion), or 86.7 percent of the amount the government planned
for that period.
	   The revenues were down largely because the ruble lost much of
its value after it was devalued in August and tax returns
plummeted.
	   State coffers will also be too empty to fulfill dlrs 8 billion
in already signed forward contracts, under which the government
promises to sell dollars to foreign investors at a fixed exchange
rate at a future date, Zhukov said.
	   The lack of a plan to boost revenues and slash spending, six
weeks after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov took office, has
worried international lenders.
	   Primakov held a Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss just such a
program for dealing with Russia's latest economic crisis.
	   The program is a ``very thorough document'' combining urgent
matters with long-term goals, Primakov said over the weekend.
Following Monday's discussion, the Cabinet will spend another week
finalizing the plan, he said.
	   The plan is likely to favor industrial giants left over from
Soviet times that are ``capable of increasing (their) contribution
to revenues which the country needs so badly,'' Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants said Monday, according to Interfax.
	   The International Monetary fund and other lenders want to see a
sound economic plan is being implemented before releasing more of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated during the summer.
	   Shapovalyants said the IMF would be the first to read the new
plan.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank reported Monday that Russia's money
supply rose by one percent in a week, a sign that it is printing
more money. Russia's Central Bank has said it plans to print
another 20 billion rubles this year to help cover the budget
deficit.

Jansher Khan to miss U.S. Open at Harvard

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three-time U.S. Open squash champion Jansher Khan
has withdrawn from this year's event due to continuing injury
problems.
	   Khan, who recently dropped from No. 1 to No. 2 in the world
rankings, will miss the Oct. 31-Nov. 3 championships at Harvard in
Cambridge, Ma.
	   The Pakistani star underwent surgery on both knees after April's
British Open. Making his comeback in August at the Hong Kong Open,
he withdrew during his first-round match suffering from a groin
strain.
	   The Professional Squash Association said Monday that world No. 1
Peter Nicol of Scotland, the 1994 U.S. Open champ, will be the top
seed. Defending champion Jonathon Power of Canada is No. 2,
followed by Australia's world champion Rodney Eyles, the 1996
winner.
	   The PSA said Khan will arrive in London this week for further
medical checks. He is planning to return to action at the World
Open in Qatar in November.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who has been reduced to a part-time
president in recent months, was ailing again Monday and canceled
yet another foreign trip, this time to recuperate from high-blood
pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health is a source of daily speculation, and a
growing chorus of critics questions his fitness to guide Russia
through its worst economic crisis in the post-Soviet era.
	   The president's doctors ordered Yeltsin not to make a one-day
trip to Austria on Tuesday because he was suffering from an
``asthenic condition,'' that makes him very weak, both physically
and emotionally, the president's office said.
	   Asthenia refers to a lack of bodily strength. Yeltsin's blood
pressure was also unstable, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said, adding that doctors recommended a vacation for the president.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip to Vienna for
talks with the European Union instead.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign _ and he insists he won't _ he would
be replaced temporarily by Primakov, who would be required to call
new elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister only six weeks and has yet to
produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at a secluded country home
in the woods west of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and
his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two
years that remain of his term, and deny he has crippling health
problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office. He visits the Kremlin perhaps two or three
times a week, and usually only for a few hours at a time.
	   Public appearances and foreign trips have become rare, and
potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin.
	   The leading contenders include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a
former general and now governor of a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, and his critics say he lacks the political and
physical strength to take on any major projects.
	   There's a growing debate in Russia about whether it would be
better for Yeltsin to serve out his term, even in his weakened
state, or if it would be better for him to step down now.
	   The president's critics argue that Yeltsin cannot handle an
extremely difficult job and should quit. But others say his
resignation would create a political crisis in addition to the
current economic turbulence, further destabilizing the country.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. Doctors said last
week he had recovered.
	   Yet Monday, Yakushkin said a committee of doctors that usually
meets before Yeltsin travels ``unanimously voted for canceling the
(Austria) trip.'' There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin,
Yakushkin said.
	   In Vienna, Yeltsin had been scheduled to meet Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two were expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, and Russia's economic
crisis.
	   Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin will no longer travel
abroad. He has already canceled a visit to Malaysia that was
planned for next month, but a visit to India in December is still
on his schedule.

Companies claim large losses caused by counterfeit goods

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Counterfeiting of goods and illegal use of
trademarks in Central and East Europe is costing multinationals
billions of dollars and jeopardizing future investment in the
region, company representatives and U.N. experts said Monday.
	   Worldwide piracy in the car parts trade alone costs the industry
some dlrs 3 billion each year, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Europe said.
	   Jeans maker Levi Strauss and motor manufacturer Ford are among
companies joining international agencies, law firms and others at a
U.N.-organized forum this week to discuss ways of helping law
enforcers in the region combat the problem.
	   The brand protection division of Levi Strauss seized 1.5 million
illegal copies of the company's products in 1997 in the region,
division official Sandrine Besnard-Corblet told a news conference.
	   The firm's brand is among the 10 most copied in the world, she
said. In Europe, Levi Strauss currently is pursuing legal action in
350 separate cases of suspected counterfeiting.
	   Copies of Levi products that find their way onto the Russian
market are manufactured in Turkey and Serbia, Besnard-Corblet said.
	   Executives at motor manufacturer Ford of Europe are increasingly
concerned about the number of fake copies of its car components
flowing into Central and Eastern Europe, Kevin England, the
company's parts brand protection group manager, said.
	   Ford estimates it loses dlrs 100 million a year because of
piracy.
	   The company fears imitations of its alloy wheels, which it says
are made in Poland, are of inferior quality and potentially
dangerous, England said. Ford believes there is a link between the
counterfeiting operations and organized crime.
	   ``We look at it not just from a business point of view, but also
customer safety,'' he said.
	   Problems arise in the region because there is a huge demand for
the goods from a relatively poor population, the commission said in
a news release.
	   Police, customs and judicial authorities in most of the region's
developing economies lack experience in enforcing existing
regulations, the release said.
	   The forum is expected to set up a working party to identify
shortfalls and recommend improvements.

Day 2 at Italy's new international air hub: Still a mess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with SwissAir saying it will ask
Italy's Supreme Court to let it use other airport; 1,000 passengers
stranded at new airport overnight. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MALPENSA, Italy (AP) _ Flights four hours or more late. Waits of
up to five hours for baggage. Scarce taxis and no shuttle buses.
Not enough parking places for planes.
	   In short, the debut of Italy's new international air hub outside
Milan, Malpensa 2000, on Sunday was chaos. And things were no
better on Monday.
	   Day 2 dawned with passengers still waiting for planes, or bags.
Airport officials reported serious glitches in the computer
systems.
	   By afternoon, 64 flights had been canceled and six diverted to
other airports. More than 1,000 passengers had spent the night at
Malpensa, waiting for flights out; 2,000 pieces of luggage were yet
to be reunited with their owners.
	   Flight delays averaged at least an hour, with 90-minute average
waits for baggage. At one point, Malpensa was closed to air traffic
for a half-hour because it had run out of parking places for
planes.
	   Malpensa, named after a nearby community, quickly got a new name
from critics _ ``Malpensata,'' meaning, ``badly thought out.''
Transport Minister Tiziano Treu objected, calling the nickname
``ungenerous.''
	   Airport officials have tried to make the best of things,
pointing out the chaos suffered when Hong Kong and Oslo opened new
airports this year. At the same time, they admitted to a ``series
of dysfunctions.''
	   Malpensa has been controversial from the outset, in great part
because it is much farther from Milan than the city's other
airport, Linate. The European Commission, troubled by the lack of
good rail and road links, gave Italy permission to shift flights to
Malpensa only last week.
	   On Monday, Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel in Zurich
called facilities at the new hub unacceptable, and said Swissair
would appeal to Italy's Supreme Court against the forced move from
Linate to Malpensa.
	   Swissair and eight other airlines earlier lost a similar appeal
to a Milan court.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the center of Milan,
compared to 10 kilometers (six miles) for Linate. A rail link won't
be finished until at least mid-1999 and the widening of the
Milan-Malpensa highway won't be complete until next year.
	   With double the number of gates and check-in counters as Linate,
Malpensa is expected to handle 18 million passengers a year
compared to Linate's 10 million and 58 flights an hour compared to
Linate's 32.

25 Rwandan genocide suspects announce a hunger strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Twenty-five suspects facing trial before
the U.N. court on the Rwanda genocide announced a hunger strike
Monday to protest what they called the panel's bias and its refusal
to pay for suspects' choices of defense attorneys.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of tribunal-appointed defense
attorneys free-of-charge, and has said suspects may select
non-tribunal attorneys but that the court will not pay for them.
	   The 25 suspects said they were joining the hunger strike of a
convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating last
week because the U.N. tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as defense attorney.
	   Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier this
month for his role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when Tutsi-dominated rebels defeated government forces.
	   In a letter Monday to the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda, in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, the 25
suspects accused the court of bias, indifference to detainees'
complaints and an inability to ``understand defense arguments.''
They also said suspects should have their pick of defense
attorneys.
	   ``For all these reasons, those in detention have decided to
observe a hunger strike as of Oct. 26,'' the letter said.
	   Tribunal spokesman Kingsley Moghalu said court officials
received the letter but declined to say if the detainees actually
had stopped eating.
	   The tribunal ``will not be intimidated or blackmailed by
Akayesu,'' Moghalu said.
	   Moghalu said the tribunal offered Akayesu a choice of six
lawyers, but he failed to respond by a court-set deadline on
Friday. Akayesu has fired attorneys three times.
	   Akayesu is doing well despite his hunger strike, Moghalu said.
	   Speaking in his own defense at his sentencing, Akayesu said he
had been unable to stop the genocide, and begged for forgiveness
from Rwanda's people.

IMF mission in Ukraine to check compliance with loan terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A delegation from the International
Monetary Fund began checking Monday to see if Ukraine is meeting
requirements necessary for the release of the next installment of a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   Presidential economic adviser Valery Lytvytsky said the
government has kept to promised budget deficit levels and foreign
currency reserves, which are among the major economic indicators
the IMF studies before disbursing aid.
	   Top IMF officials had planned to reach a decision on the loan
Monday, but put it off until Thursday so the delegation can study
the former Soviet republic's negotiations over unpaid debts to a
foreign bank.
	   Ukraine was scheduled to pay off dlrs 109 million to the Chase
Manhattan Luxembourg S.A. bank last Tuesday, but the cash-strapped
government instead offered to pay 20 percent of the sum immediately
and convert the rest into two-year bonds with a 20 percent annual
interest rate.
	   The two sides eventually agreed to the deal.
	   The scheme is similar to a debt conversion plan Ukraine offered
to foreign holders of its treasury bills last month, when Ukraine
began feeling the aftershocks of the financial crisis in
neighboring Russia.
	   The IMF disbursed the first, dlrs 257 million tranche of its
three-year loan to Ukraine in September, and Ukraine hopes to
receive another dlrs 125 million from the fund by the end of the
year.
	   The IMF delegation, which arrived Monday and is scheduled to
stay until Nov. 6, will also discuss a reform program it agreed to
support when it created the loan.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost the
first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli guard was
shot in the neck and his body thrown from a moving car in an
apparent attack by Palestinian militants. There was no claim of
responsibility.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new agreement under which Israel
is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hard-liners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down Netanyahu.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading could be
held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in three
readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by at least 60
votes in the 120-member legislature. Supporters said they were
confident they could pass the legislation.
	   Porat, an opponent of the peace agreement, said the suggested
date for holding early elections would be March 16.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace agreement
over the next 12 weeks.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet to be voted on later Monday.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli guard in Hebron raised
new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal can
withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   The killing occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon GMT) in the
downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is under
Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving in the neighborhood
when they saw a car coming toward them at high speed. Moments
later, they saw a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   Palestinian paramedics pronounced the victim dead at the scene.
They said he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants had used the victim's
car to escape.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day before NATO's latest deadline,
tanks and armored vehicles rumbled back to barracks Monday in
Kosovo, as the Yugoslav government sought to convince the Alliance
it is complying with demands to avoid airstrikes.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed Alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
remove more troops from front lines.
	   In an apparent sign of compliance, a NATO official, speaking to
reporters on condition of anonymity, said intelligence reports show
``some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal.''
	   Still, he said, NATO remains was ready to use military force
once a deadline for compliance runs out at 1900 gmt Tuesday. The
deadline was already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a
peace plan Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return safely to their homes.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province, part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Kosovo, a convoy of more than two dozen Yugoslav tanks,
trucks and other armored vehicles was seen Monday rolling through
the Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, but the
policemen manning the small house at the intersection remained on
duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic there.
	   The government's Serb Media Center said three military units
were returning to their barracks in Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said if the Serbs follow
through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops, ``that will
certainly be a significant advance. But we want to see the evidence
first.''
	   NATO's ``planes are still on the runway,'' ready for airstrikes,
Cook said in Luxembourg. ``If Milosevic does not want them to take
off, then it is up to him to comply. He knows what he has got to
do.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demanded that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.
	   On Monday, a planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived
in Prsitina with the first direct shipment of international
humanitarian aid, including medicine and blankets.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade before proceeding overland to Kosovo.
Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies. U.S. officials described the aid flight as a
test case for compliance with the aid portion of the Oct. 12
accord.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with terms
of the agreement. Ethnic Albanians, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass refugees.
	   On Monday, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
claimed Serb forces shelled four villages in the Klina area, 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital. The center claimed the
same villages were shelled Sunday evening for 90 minutes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Sunday, mourners dived for cover when gunfire whistled
overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence would not protect
the mourners from more gunfire.

Two independent dailies halt publishing

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with two independent dailies deciding to
halt publishing, opposition party comment, campaign to protest
media law to be launched. &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Serbian independent dailies
halted publishing Monday after police raided the office and
confiscated property of another non-government newspaper fined for
alleged anti-state activity.
	   Nasa Borba and Danas, who had been briefly banned by the
government earlier this month, said they would not resume
publishing to protest a new media law imposing censorship on the
fledgling independent media.
	   Also Monday, editors of Serbia's independent media agreed to
launch a public campaign to fight the latest media restrictions
imposed by the authorities loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Police raided the office of Dnevni Telegraf daily late Sunday,
taking away equipment to forcefully collect a fine that its
publisher and editor had been ordered to pay under the new law
passed by the Serbian parliament last week.
	   Armed police also surrounded the apartment building of Slavko
Curuvija, the editor, threatening to seize his property. But they
left after realizing the flat did not belong to Curuvija.
	   ``What is happening now is ... destroying the image of your
country,'' said U.N. human rights official Jiri Dientsbier, who
arrived at the scene. ``I will ask the international community to
support the existence of free media in Serbia.''
	   The media law last Tuesday banned Serbian-language programs by
foreign media and empowered the authorities to punish publishers
and journalists for any articles or photos deemed damaging to the
state.
	   On Friday, a Belgrade court ruled that Curuvija, the DT Press
company, another editor and a magazine manager violated the law by
publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing
``dictatorship'' and leading the country into political and
economic chaos.
	   The article, along with two disputed photographs, appeared in
Evropljanin (European) weekly, also published by DT Press and
edited by Curuvija, from the same premises in downtown Belgrade.
	   Dozens of desks, telephones and other equipment were loaded onto
trucks under police supervision and taken away. The police swoop
also prevented the printing of 100,000 copies of Dnevni Telegraf's
Monday issue.
	   The accused journalists said they could not and would not pay
the fines which total 2.4 million dinars (dlrs 246,000). The fines
for Curuvija and DT Press are 800,000 dinars (dlrs 82,000) each.
The other two were fined 400,000 dinars (dlrs 41,000) each.
	   The law was passed amid anti-Western sentiment in the country
fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the crisis in
Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav
troops in the southern Serbian province.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship that Serbia formally abandoned in the 1980s and drags
Serb-led Yugoslavia back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   The opposition Democratic Party compared the repression to the
former fascist and Communist regimes, saying ``it is obvious a new
period is starting in Serbia in which the regime will try to spread
fear.''

Thousands of marathoners observe minute's silence for Noel Carroll

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Thousands of participants in the Dublin
City Marathon observed a minute's silence Monday in memory of Noel
Carroll, the Irish track trailblazer who died unexpectedly from a
heart attack.
	   Carroll, 56, died Friday after completing his usual noontime
jog, with plans to run as usual in the annual 26-mile (42-km)
marathon that starts and finishes on Dublin's broad O'Connell
Street.
	   He will be buried Tuesday after Mass at St. Anne's Catholic
church in suburban south Dublin.
	   Best known in the United States for his 1960s exploits as a
world-class middle-distance runner at Villanova University, Carroll
had spent the past 25 years at the vocal forefront of developments
in the Irish capital, serving most recently as chief executive of
Dublin Chamber of Commerce.
	   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern led tributes to Carroll, calling him
``the epitome of professionalism on behalf of his beloved city of
Dublin.''
	   ``As a talented sportsman, brilliant communicator and
clear-minded thinker, he was outstanding in his generation,'' said
Ahern.
	   Born Dec. 7, 1941 in rural County Louth, Carroll left school at
age 13 and joined the Irish army, where he defied his oversized
proportions _ 6-foot-3 (1.88 meters) and some 200 pounds (90 kgs) _
to develop his lifelong passion for running.
	   As an 18-year-old Carroll rewrote the Irish track record book
and set several European and world records for his age group, being
named Irish Athlete of the Year in 1961.
	   The following year Villanova's renowned track coach James
Elliott recruited Carroll to the university outside Philadelphia
after spotting him at a competition in New York. Carroll anchored
the 880-meters relay team that set a world record, but he failed to
win any medals for Ireland in the 1964 and 1968 Olympic Games.
	   From 1972 to 1996 he was the voice of Dublin's urban authority,
the Dublin Corporation, often grabbing headlines with no-nonsense
views on development and social problems facing the city.
	   He maintained the style after moving to the Chamber of Commerce
two years ago. In recent months he courted controversy by fighting
losing battles against governments plans to build an above-ground
commuter rail system through central Dublin, and to shut down key
roads in the capital to accommodate the Tour be France cycling
race.
	   Carroll also championed an Irish foreign-aid agency called Goal.
He donated royalties from his 1982 autobiography ``The Runner's
Log,'' organized an annual fund-raising run, and served as the
charity's chairman. Last year he clashed with the government over
its decision to cut off funding because Goal kept inadequate
accounts.
	   He is survived by his wife, singer and harpist Deirdre
O'Callaghan; their four children Enda, 33, Nicola, 32, Noel, 28,
and Stephen, 24; and five grandchildren.

WBC chief denounces proliferation of boxing bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ World Boxing Council President
Jose Sulaiman called Monday for an end to the proliferation of
international boxing bodies.
	   Sulaiman made the appeal at the opening of the WBC's annual
convention, in which boxing promoters were to consider accepting an
agreement to unify rules with the World Boxing Association.
	   The agreement _ hammered out by the WBC and the WBA in a meeting
in Mexico City last April _ is aimed at standardizing the names of
weight categories, the awarding of points, procedures for drug
testing and could eventually result in only one champion in each
weight category.
	   Sulaiman urged an investigation into international boxing
organizations, saying they must prove the validity of their alleged
world status.
	   If action was not taken soon, ``boxing will die in 50 years, and
will become merely a circus,'' he told WBC delegates at a
convention center north of Johannesburg.
	   Major boxing bodies include the WBC, the WBA, the International
Boxing Federation and the World Boxing Organization.
	   (sapa-aos)
	   ``It is time to stop deceiving the boxing fans of the world,''
said Sulaiman, opening the annual WBC convention in Johannesburg in
front of a gathering which included former amateur boxer President
Mandela.
	   ``Most of these champions, with all due respect, are not
champions of the world,'' he said. ``Those organisations are
selling to the people a lie, and to sell a lie is nothing but a
fraud.
	   ``Let us stop it for the sake of credibility, for the sake of
the respect that the sport of boxing deserves.''
	   In an emotion-charged speech paying tribute to President Mandela
and emphasising the WBC's role in condemning apartheid over the
years, Sulaiman also urged the establishment of a fund so that
boxing could provide pensions ``for our heroes of the past.''
	   He had learned Monday of the plight of former boxers Alphonse
Halimi of Algeria and Lote Mwale of Zambia, who were both in a sad
financial way.
	   The WBC would give both monthly pensions, he said, but more had
to be done for the many ex-boxers in a similar situation.
	   Sulaiman said he would propose this week that new championships
should be launched for boxers of 21 and younger.
	   The aim would be to give young fighters something to aim at, and
obviate the need to take on old fighters before they were mature,
``and overcome professional sharks who have stopped and hurt so
many young boxers, paying them peanuts.''
	   Sulaiman presented President Mandela with the WBC's Award of
Human Dignity and a WBC championship belt.

Confrontation at sea between Israeli, Palestinian navies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Israeli and Palestinian coast
guards cocked their guns at one another in a tense two-hour stand
off at sea over who controlled the Mediterranean off the Gaza
coastline.
	   The incident began after Palestinian forces, armed with
Kalachnikov rifles boarded a rented yacht carrying an Israeli
television crew filming a news documentary on an ship which sunk in
the area 50 years ago.
	   ``Palestinian soldiers showed up in four rubber boats and
circled us,'' said Channel 2 news reporter Dov Gil-Har. ``At first
I thought they were there to protect us, but very quickly they
boarded our ship with Kalachnikovs and would not let us move,'' he
said.
	   Haim Assias, an Israeli cameraman, said the Palestinians told
the group of 15 Israeli they would be escorted to the shore of
Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
	   The crew radioed the Israeli navy which told the group not to
comply with the Palestinians. Shortly afterwards, four Israeli
patrol boats showed up.
	   Assias said patrolmen from both sides cocked their guns at one
another during a tense two hour incident.
	   ``It was not pleasant,'' Assias said. ``One soldier can make a
mistake and it would be hell.''
	   The incident ended peacefully and the Israeli film crew
completed the day's work.
	   Under Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, Israel retains security
of international borders and water-ways.
	   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said his navy is allowed to patrol the first six miles of waters
from the Gaza shore before Israel takes control and that the
Israeli crew needed permission to film in the area. A spokeswoman
for Channel 2 said that all necessary permits were obtained from
the Palestinian and Israeli navies.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Three crew members aboard a
Czech military helicopter were killed when it crashed into the
hillside above a remote field, Czech military officials said
Monday.
	   No rescue teams were immediately able to reach the crash site,
believed to be in a mined field, but the Czech Defense Ministry in
Prague confirmed late Monday that all three men aboard the Czech
Mi-17 ``Hip'' helicopter died in the crash.
	   The chopper disappeared late Sunday while on a routine transport
flight from Gornji Vakuf in the northwest of Bosnia to the Croatian
port of Split.
	   British helicopters spotted the helicopter Monday, crashed into
a hillside near Tomislavgrad, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest
of Sarajevo, said Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a NATO spokesman in
Sarajevo.
	   Chamberlain said it was still too early to say what caused the
crash. Local officials said heavy rainstorm was raging in the area,
at the time of the crash.
	   The helicopter and its crew were based out of northwestern town
of Velika Kladusa, as part of the Czech Battalion which belongs to
the 36,000 strong multinational peacekeepers.
	   Since NATO deployed it's multinational peace force in Bosnia
three years ago, 86 participants have died while on duty in
non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic accidents or land-mine
blasts.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day before NATO's latest deadline,
tanks and armored vehicles rumbled back to barracks Monday in
Kosovo, as the Yugoslav government sought to convince the Alliance
it is complying with demands to avoid airstrikes.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed Alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
remove more troops from front lines.
	   In an apparent sign of compliance, a NATO official, speaking to
reporters on condition of anonymity, said intelligence reports show
``some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal.''
	   Still, he said, NATO remains was ready to use military force
once a deadline for compliance runs out at 1900 gmt Tuesday. The
deadline was already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a
peace plan Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return safely to their homes.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province, part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Kosovo, a convoy of more than two dozen Yugoslav tanks,
trucks and other armored vehicles was seen Monday rolling through
the Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, but the
policemen manning the small house at the intersection remained on
duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic there.
	   The government's Serb Media Center said three military units
were returning to their barracks in Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President
Clinton was monitoring developments. ``There appears to be a lot of
movement'' of Serb troops, Lockhart said, adding, ``We haven't seen
enough'' pullbacks.
	   ``We're going to wait until the dust settles'' to judge whether
Milosevic is in compliance with NATO demands, he said.
	   But Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, that said if the
Serbs follow through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops,
``that will certainly be a significant advance. But we want to see
the evidence first.''
	   NATO's ``planes are still on the runway,'' ready for airstrikes,
Cook added in Luxembourg. ``If Milosevic does not want them to take
off, then it is up to him to comply. He knows what he has got to
do.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demanded that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.
	   On Monday, a planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived
in Prsitina with the first direct shipment of international
humanitarian aid, including medicine and blankets.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade before proceeding overland to Kosovo.
Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies. U.S. officials described the aid flight as a
test case for compliance with the aid portion of the Oct. 12
accord.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with terms
of the agreement. Ethnic Albanians, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass refugees.
	   On Monday, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
claimed Serb forces shelled four villages in the Klina area, 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital. The center claimed the
same villages were shelled Sunday evening for 90 minutes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Sunday, mourners dived for cover when gunfire whistled
overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence would not protect
the mourners from more gunfire.

Interpol delegates approve Egyptian anti-terrorism plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ International police officials have approved
an Egyptian proposal that calls for increased cooperation to fight
terrorism, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
	   The proposal, presented at the 67th General Assembly of
Interpol, stressed the need to ``overcome obstacles impeding the
handing over of terrorists,'' the agency reported.
	   The plan also calls for the convening of an international
conference on combating terrorism.
	   Egypt, which has suffered major attacks from Islamic militants,
has been lobbying for such a summit, arguing that terrorism is a
global phenomenon.
	   Late last year, Islamic militants killed 67 tourists in two
separate attacks.
	   The proposal was accepted by 103 countries. Five nations
abstained and one voted against the draft.

Blatter repeats _ in England _ he favors 2006 World Cup in Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's quest to host the 2006 World Cup took a
hit Monday when the head of FIFA _ the governing body of world
soccer _ told Prime Minister Tony Blair that Africa was the
``logical'' choice for soccer's showcase.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter met for 45 minutes Monday at No. 10
Downing Street with Blair and English soccer officials pushing the
England bid.
	   Bidding opens next month and England, South Africa and Germany
are regarded as the main contenders. Blatter said he also expects
bids from Brazil, Morocco, Nigeria and Egypt.
	   The winner will be announced in March 2000 after a vote by a
24-member FIFA committee.
	   While campaigning in June for the FIFA presidency, Blatter said
Africa was the logical choice following the 1994 World Cup in the
United States, the 1998 tournament in France, and the 2002 World
Cup to be shared between South Korea and Japan.
	   ``I have just confirmed to the prime minister that I have not
changed my attitude, which I had when I campaigned for president,''
Blatter said.
	   ``I repeated to the prime minister that if an African nation...
will meet all the conditions _ stadia, systems of transport,
telecommunications, security, hotels and so on....then it would be
logical to give the 2006 World Cup to an African country,'' he
said.
	   Blatter said he wasn't put off by a recent upsurge in English
soccer violence, which included widely reported rioting by English
fans in Marseilles during the World Cup.
	   ``I'm not concerned about hooliganism in England,'' he said.
``I'm concerned about hooligans accompanying the England team.''
	   Despite Blatter's preference for Africa, British Sports Minister
Tony Banks remained upbeat about England's chances.
	   ``I believe it is now between us and South Africa,'' he said.
``Basically we are ready for 2006. All we need now is for the
redevelopment of Wembley to get under way.''
	   Banks said hooliganism should not hamper England's candidacy.
	   ``The prime minister made it quite clear that legislation is
going to be brought forward with regards to tightening a number of
loopholes that exist in dealing with these people (hooligans),'' he
said.
	   Germany's World Cup bid, which is supported by UEFA president
Lennart Johansson, received a boost this weekend when Franz
Beckenbauer was elected vice president of the German soccer
federation.

Israeli guard slain, thrown from speeding car in Hebron

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his dead body thrown from a moving car Monday in
Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the slaying.
	   Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's killing occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon GMT) in the
downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, an area that is under
Israeli control and about 400 yards (meters) from the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving in the neighborhood
when they saw a car coming toward them at high speed. They then saw
a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
his head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron.
	   Palestinian paramedics pronounced the victim dead at the scene.
They said he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts that the
victim worked as a security guard at an electric station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants escaped in the victim's
car.

Tuesday's scheduled meeting between President Joao Bernardo Vieira
and Brig. Ansumane Mane, a Portuguese Foreign Ministry spokesman
said.
	   The foes were respecting a truce ahead of the planned talks,
spokesman Horacio Cesar said.
	   No further details were available of what aspects the
ambassadors were discussing.
	   Mane led a military rebellion June 7, a day after Vieira
dismissed him as Armed Forces chief-of-staff on allegations that he
was running arms to separatists in Senegal's southern Casamance
province.
	   The rebels claimed Vieira was corrupt and called for early
elections, which had been scheduled for later this year.
	   Senegal has deployed some 3,000 heavily-armed troops in the
neighboring country to aid Vieira, but the insurgents _ mostly army
veterans angered by poor pay and conditions _ have overrun most of
the country.
	   ``The rebels clearly have the upper-hand,'' Cesar said.
	   The fighting has prompted a humanitarian crisis in the former
Portuguese colony. About half the population of 1 million have fled
their homes and urgently require food and medical assistance, aid
workers say.
	   The World Food Program said Monday it planned to distribute 300
tons of emergency food aid this week to about 80,000 displaced
people in Prabis and Cumura, small towns near the coastal capital
Bissau.
	   WFP spokesman Wagdi Othman said by phone from Abidjan, Ivory
Coast, that the displaced people are living in makeshift camps with
no food or drinking water.

Dutch government fights to keep private information private
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-US-Data Privacy &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Companies buying or selling
personal data in the Netherlands, beware _ the Dutch government is
going all-out to protect the personal data of its citizens.
	   The Data Protection Commission, part of the Dutch Ministry of
Justice, acts as a watchdog for consumers whose personal
information may be bartered for marketing purposes without their
consent.
	   ``We want to see people made more aware of the consequences of
giving out personal information,'' commission spokesman Erik
Bogaards said Monday. ``People are often bombarded with information
they didn't ask for. It's an irritation.''
	   On Sunday, an EU law came into effect to protect data privacy.
The law has already been written into the statute books of Greece
and Portugal, and is also being implemented in Britain, Sweden and
Italy along with additional rules.
	   In the Netherlands, Boogards' commission keeps a watch out for
more serious violations of privacy laws, which prohibit the use of
personal information for anything other than the original intent
for which it was solicited.
	   Recently, the commission has observed a lurking danger in the
privatization of government agencies, Bogaards said. As private
companies take over government duties such as distribution of
employee benefits, the companies become privy to personal
information that may tempt some to sell or use for their own
marketing efforts.
	   Though the agency does not enforce privacy laws, it does make
recommendations that, if presented in a court, are taken very
seriously, Bogaards said.
	   ``It's taken nearly as seriously as a court order,'' he said.
	   The agency, which has been protecting the privacy of the Dutch
since 1989, handles about 7,000 inquiries a year, Bogaards said.
Most of those are consumers or companies seeking the government's
free information about the legality of specific use of personal
information.
	   This year, the commission investigated Jehovah's Witnesses who
may have used illegal methods to obtain information. People
complained that the religious group targeted disabled people for
their home visits. That case is still under review, Bogaards said.
	   ``People are not aware of the implications when they hand over
personal data,'' he said. ``Then they are surprised when they are
bombarded with information. They just don't see the connection.''
	   The registry usually issues advice to the parties involved
following an investigation but it can also inform prosecutors if
illegal practices are uncovered.
	   Bogaards said criminal proceedings are unusual in such cases.

Opel names new chairman amid signs of tension with GM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end with quotes from Burns on Cowger needed back in
U.S.; Opel and Saab to remain distinct &QL; 
 &UR; By CARSTEN HERZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., Adam Opel AG, named new top bosses Monday to resolve
a boardroom crisis caused by the abrupt recall of its chairman to
Detroit.
	   Robert Hendry, head of GM's Swedish Saab division, will replace
Gary Cowger as chairman of the management board on Nov. 1, Opel
said. Opel personnel chief Wolfgang Strinz was named Hendry's
deputy.
	   The arrangement was seen as a face-saving compromise for GM and
its German managers at Opel, which has suffered from declining
profits and market share in recent years.
	   Union leaders had complained the management turmoil of recent
weeks was only hurting the company's image further.
	   ``We have to have an end to the chaos,'' said Rudi Mueller,
chairman of the Opel works council at the main Ruesselsheim plant.
``We want to produce cars again instead of headlines.''
	   The bickering goes back to June, when GM installed Cowger as
chairman of Opel's management board over much German resistance.
Then last week it suddenly decided to recall him to Detroit to head
GM's troubled U.S. labor relations.
	   On Saturday, in a surprise move seen as another sign of
worsening relations, Hans Wilhelm Gaeb resigned as supervisory
board chairman after almost 18 years in office.
	   An Opel statement said only that Gaeb's resignation was due to
differing perceptions of the company's business strategies.
	   GM had sought to replace Cowger with Peter Hanenberger, the
European product development chief, but German unions opposed
naming him, because they blamed him for quality problems at Opel in
recent years.
	   Opel's German board, which had to approve the chairman, is
evenly divided between labor and management representatives.
	   With Hendry, GM maintains an American at the top of Opel, while
Strinz becomes the highest-ranking German at the company.
	   Seeking to improve its global performance, GM recently announced
plans to merge its two big, independent automotive units for North
America and the rest of the world into one. The new boss is an
American, G. Richard Wagoner Jr.
	   At an extraordinary meeting Monday, the supervisory board tapped
Hans Barth, vice president in charge of project and production
support for GM Europe, to take over for Gaeb, effective
immediately.
	   At a news conference, Barth said GM and the Opel team had
settled all disputed questions over the past few days.
	   Michael Burns, head of GM's European Operations, said Cowger had
to go back to Detroit because he was the only one able to deal with
GM's labor problems following this summer's damaging strikes there.
	   ``Nobody expected the severity of the strike in the U.S. when
the decision about the change at Opel was made'' in June, said
Burns, who was also named to the supervisory board to fill Gaeb's
vacancy.
	   Hendry will retain his title at Saab for two years, while
spending most of his time at Opel, Barth said. A deputy will be
named at Saab to handle the daily work there.
	   Burns stressed that Opel and Saab will remain two independent
brands. However, he didn't rule out that Hendry's dual leadership
role will result in closer cooperation between the two GM units.

Runaway train hits Russian bus, killing nine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three runaway train cars loaded with concrete
collided with a bus Monday in the Russian Far East, killing at
least nine people and injuring 25, a news report said.
	   The bus was torn apart when the rail cars carrying concrete
panels and other construction materials rammed into it at an
unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   It was unclear how the cars detached from their train.
	   The Interfax news agency said nine people were killed, but
Russia's ORT television station put the death toll at 13.
	   Twenty-two people were hospitalized, and another three were
treated at the scene, Interfax said.
	   More than 100 rescuers were working at the site of the crash.

Report: South African truth panel to condemn ANC

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The institution exploring
apartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the African
National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it
struggled to overcome white rule.
	   The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings. South
African media released preliminary findings on Monday, three days
before its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital.
	   The release of the document is a milestone in South Africa's
transformation from white minority rule to democracy. The
commission, which has the power to grant amnesty, was tasked with
promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and why of
apartheid-era atrocities.
	   With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid-1999, a
condemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to its
electoral chances and moral standing.
	   There has been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame
would be laid on white governments and their security forces during
the years under scrutiny, 1960-1994.
	   Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission would
declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the
ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting a
legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state.
	   But in preliminary findings sent to the parties last month, the
commission also said the two movements were ``morally and
politically accountable'' for gross rights violations, South
African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp.
said.
	   The preliminary finding said that despite ANC policy against
killing civilians, the line between military and civilian targets
had been blurred, SAPA said.
	   It condemned the planting of landmines in rural areas, the
execution of enemy agents, torture and mistreatment of ANC members
in its exile camps and for killing political opponents.
	   It said the party must accept responsibility for the activities
of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson
Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club,
accused of killings, torture and kidnappings.
	   The commission also said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of
civilians in its strategy in 1993 to drive white farmers off their
land so it could be reclaimed by blacks.
	   Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria,
would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the
ANC.
	   ``I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expect
everyone to agree. It will lead to healthy debate,'' he said.
	   He said that if the commissioners recommends prosecutions
against anyone for abuses, it will be up to the national director
of prosecutions to decide whether to proceed. The director is
appointed by the government.
	   The commission's work is designed ``to help us establish the
rule of law in South Africa, and to establish the principle of
accountability,'' Omar said.
	   The ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding,
saying weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh
judgments were in the offing.
	   The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting
with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid
appearing biased.
	   On Monday, it rejected ``with contempt'' suggestions ANC
officials themselves had leaked the findings. Constand Viljoen,
leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC had done
so to give the commission credibility by making it more
even-handed.
	   Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those
committed during a ``just war.''
	   F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, meanwhile,
planned to ask
	   a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating
him in covering up state-sponsored terror.
	   ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar
said, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.

	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ The strongest hurricane of
the season lashed Jamaica with heavy rain and flooded parts of the
Cayman Islands with huge sea swells as it slowly plowed through the
western Caribbean on Monday.
	   The full force of Hurricane Mitch's 155 mph (250 kph) winds did
not strike Jamaica and the Caymans, but rain squalls from the huge
storm flooded streets in the Jamaican capital of Kingston. Under a
tropical storm warning, hotel workers in the Caymans boarded up
windows and moved tourists to shelter.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a hurricane
warning for eastern Honduras and said those in Belize, Mexico's
Yucatan peninsula and western Cuba should monitor the dangerous
Category 4 hurricane.
	   At midmorning, Mitch's center was 85 miles (135 kilometers)
east-southeast of Honduras' Swan Islands and was moving west at 8
mph (13 kph). It had swelled to nearly 300 miles (48 kilometers)
across and U.S. forecasters said it could grow even stronger
Monday.
	   Honduran officials declared an alert Sunday and warned that
Mitch could hit the coast today. Officials prepared to evacuate
residents and asked fishermen to keep their boats in port.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, schools
closed Monday, boat owners secured their vessels and residents
stocked up on food, water, batteries and other essentials. A
planned release of 400 endangered green sea turtle hatchlings was
postponed.

EU ministers seek consensus on funds for candidate countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - European Union countries on Monday struggled
to rally Spain behind a fund distribution plan for 10 east European
applicant countries which Madrid fears could threaten the EU
support it gets for its own poorer regions.
	   EU foreign ministers did agree that when one candidate country
becomes an EU member, the overall funds for this country should be
redistributed among the remaining candidates who have still not
joined the Union.
	   But talks were inconclusive on how the 15-nation EU will extend
a system of so-called cohesion funds for poor EU regions to
candidate countries.
	   The EU has pledged 21 billion European currency units (dlrs 25
billion) for the 10 eastern European countries between 2001-2006,
to support reforms in areas such as industry, agriculture,
transport and the environment.
	   This represents an annual 3 billion ecu (dlrs 3.6 billion). A
third of those funds are cohesion funds.
	   Within the EU, a country that qualifies for cohesion funds pays
out 15 percent of these funds, while the EU forks out 85 percent.
	   Fourteen EU countries said the eastern European candidates
should pay out of their own pockets a larger share - 25 percent -
of the cohesion funds they receive. Spain wants the 15-85
sharing-out system for the EU also to apply for candidates.
	   EU officials say Spain, which benefits greatly from the cohesion
funds for less-developed regions, is afraid that a more severe
system applied to candidate countries will end up being extended to
EU countries as well.
	   ``The Union might end up saying, if applicant countries have to
pay 25 percent of the funds from their own pocket, why should EU
countries pay less?'' said an EU official who requested anonymity.
	   To soothe Spain on the issue of cohesion funds, ministers
sketched a compromise under which the EU could, in exceptional
circumstances, pay 85 percent of the cohesion funds to candidate
countries and they will pay only 15.
	   Six countries - Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia,
Estonia and Cyprus - are expected to join the Union sometime in the
middle of the next decade. The EU begins membership talks with
these countries next month.
	   Cyprus has its own financial arrangement with the Union.
	   Five other countries - Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia and
Lithuania - are on a slower track to membership.
	   The EU hopes it can settle such finicky issues as fund
distribution for applicant nations by November 10, when it opens
talks with the six fast-track countries.
	   EU ministers are also struggling to agree on painful reforms
within the EU, such as cutting farm subsidies and revamping EU
finances that are necessary before it can begin integrating new
members.
	   At an EU summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, Germany's
new Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stressed the need to accelerate
fruitless talks about reforming the EU ahead of its enlargement
into eastern Europe.

Interpol delegates approve Egyptian anti-terrorism plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ International police officials have approved
an Egyptian proposal that calls for increased cooperation to fight
terrorism, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
	   The proposal, presented at the 67th General Assembly of
Interpol, stressed the need to ``overcome obstacles impeding the
handing over of terrorists,'' the agency reported.
	   The plan also calls for an international conference on combating
terrorism.
	   Egypt, which has suffered major attacks from Islamic militants,
has been lobbying for such a summit, arguing that terrorism is a
global issue.
	   Late last year, Islamic militants killed 67 tourists in two
separate attacks in Egypt.
	   The proposal was accepted by 103 countries. Five nations
abstained and one voted against the draft.

Heiress's father sues Greek trustees for slander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In a new twist to an already complex and
bitter legal battle, the father of 13-year-old heiress to the
Onassis shipping fortune Monday sued one of her Greek trustees for
slander.
	   Lawyers acting on behalf of Thierry Roussel sued the president
of the Onassis charitable foundation for slander, just days before
the French-born former husband of the late Christina Onassis
answers to similar charges in a court here.
	   Stelios Papadimitriou, one of four Greek trustees managing
Athina Roussel's estimated dlrs 600 million estate, was sued for
allegedly describing her father as an embezzler. It was the second
such suit filed by Roussel. The other is pending.
	   Roussel has to present himself in court here Friday after the
four trustees sued him for slander after he accused them of
mismanagement and nepotism.
	   Athina's estate represents about half the fortune left by the
late Aristotle Onassis. The rest is controlled by the Onassis
Foundation, which operates the shipping enterprises and a large
charitable trust.
	   Athina will inherit the fortune on her 18th birthday.

Azerbaijani-Georgian oil pipeline to begin operating in April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A pipeline across Georgia for
transporting Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil to the West will begin
operating in April, the head of Azerbaijan's state oil company said
Monday.
	   The line connecting Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, and the Georgian
Black Sea port of Supsa will start pumping oil Apr. 1, 1999, Natik
Aliev said. Aliev was in Georgia's capital Tbilisi for talks with
President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Many U.S. oil companies have invested in Caspian projects, and
the United States wants the bulk of the crude to flow through a
longer, as-yet-unbuilt pipeline across Azerbaijan, Georgia, and
Turkey. Washington thinks that pipeline would bind those countries
closer to the West, and make an alternate oil route across Russia
and Iran less likely.
	   A decision on which pipeline will be used for most Caspian oil
is expected this month.
	   Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the
Middle East, but they remain relatively untapped because countries
with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive
projects off the ground.

Heads of public television news department resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The head of Romanian national
television's news department resigned Monday, warning that an era
of nationalism at the station could follow.
	   ``Since we came here we did something to promote more racial
tolerance, but it could easily be reversed,'' said Alina
Mungiu-Pippidi, director of the news and information department.
	   She stepped down in a show of solidarity with Anca Toader, the
department's chief editor, who resigned also Monday after she had
been demoted by the new director of Romanian TV.
	   Mungiu-Pippidi resigned after accusations that she and Toader
staged a Stalinist-style smear campaign against one of their
colleagues and unfairly promoted of another.
	   There was pressure from lawmakers for her resignation, she said
by telephone. Parliament controls the public station and votes for
the board of directors which makes appointments.
	   Mungiu-Pippidi, 34, claimed that since she promoted ethnic
tolerance at the station, opinion polls showed that Romanians were
much more tolerant toward Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians.
	   She claimed some employees in the station showed more
nationalist tendencies.
	   Mungiu-Pippidi studied at Harvard University and had some
success in making the station's news programs more impartial.
Public television is traditionally servile toward the government.
	   Two weeks ago, parliament appointed theater director Cristian
Hadji-Culea as the new head of the national television.

Confrontation at sea between Israeli, Palestinian navies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Israeli and Palestinian coast
guards confronted each other in a two-hour standoff at sea over who
controlled the Mediterranean off the Gaza coastline.
	   The incident began after Palestinian forces boarded a yacht
carrying an Israeli television crew filming a news documentary on a
ship that sank 50 years ago.
	   ``Palestinian soldiers showed up in four rubber boats and
circled us,'' said Channel 2 news reporter Dov Gil-Har. ``At first
I thought they were there to protect us,'' he said, but the
Palestinians boarded the ship and took control.
	   Israeli cameraman Haim Assias said the Palestinians told the 15
Israelis they would be escorted to the shore of
Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
	   The crew radioed the Israeli navy, which sent four patrol boats
to the scene.
	   Assias said patrolmen from both sides cocked their guns at one
another during the standoff.
	   The incident ended peacefully and the Israeli film crew
completed the day's work.
	   Under Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, Israel retains security
of international borders and waterways.
	   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said his navy is allowed to patrol the first six miles (9.6
kilometers) off the Gaza shore before Israel takes control and that
the Israeli crew needed permission to film in the area. A
spokeswoman for Channel 2 said that all necessary permits were
obtained from the Palestinian and Israeli navies.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Thousands of participants in the Dublin
City Marathon observed a minute's silence Monday in memory of Noel
Carroll, the Irish track trailblazer who died unexpectedly from a
heart attack.
	   Carroll, 56, died Friday after completing his usual noontime
jog, with plans to run as usual in the annual 26-mile (42-km)
marathon that starts and finishes on Dublin's broad O'Connell
Street.
	   He will be buried Tuesday after Mass at St. Anne's Catholic
church in suburban south Dublin.
	   Best known in the United States for his 1960s exploits as a
world-class middle-distance runner at Villanova University, Carroll
had spent the past 25 years at the vocal forefront of developments
in the Irish capital, serving most recently as chief executive of
Dublin Chamber of Commerce.
	   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern led tributes to Carroll, calling him
``the epitome of professionalism on behalf of his beloved city of
Dublin.''
	   ``As a talented sportsman, brilliant communicator and
clear-minded thinker, he was outstanding in his generation,'' said
Ahern.
	   Born Dec. 7, 1941 in rural County Louth, Carroll left school at
age 13 and joined the Irish army, where he defied his oversized
proportions _ 6-foot-3 (1.88 meters) and some 200 pounds (90 kgs) _
to develop his lifelong passion for running.
	   As an 18-year-old Carroll rewrote the Irish track record book
and set several European and world records for his age group, being
named Irish Athlete of the Year in 1961.
	   The following year Villanova's renowned track coach James
Elliott recruited Carroll to the university outside Philadelphia
after spotting him at a competition in New York. Carroll anchored
the 880-yards relay team that set a world record at the college
level, but he failed to win any medals for Ireland in the 1964 and
1968 Olympic Games.

 &UR; Sri Lanka beats New Zealand with five wickets to spare &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sri Lankan batting. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Arjuna Ranatunga's unbeaten 90 runs
scripted Sri Lanka's convincing five wicket victory over New
Zealand in their Wills Cup quarterfinal clash in the Bangabandhu
national stadium on Monday.
	   Upul Chandana was at his captain's side with an unbeaten 22 when
the Sri Lankan's tasted victory with more than eight overs to
spare.
	   Sri Lanka will play South Africa in the semifinals on October
30.
	   Chasing New Zealand's 188, Sri Lanka rattled up 191 for five in
41.3 overs, but only after surviving three crucial blows right at
the start of their innings.
	   At the start of the game, Ranatunga chose to chase a total
rather than set one. His gameplan succeeded despite the failure of
such one-day giants like Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva
with the bat.
	   Only Romesh Kaluwithrana survived the early New Zealand charge
as Simon Doull found success in consecutive overs to rock the world
champions at two for four runs in the third over.
	   Kaluwithrana and Ranatunga took it upon themselves to take the
fight to the enemy camp. Their partnership of 127 runs in 155 balls
was enough to take Sri Lanka to the sight of victory.
	   Kaluwithrana scored a useful 48 with five fours but was
brilliantly run out by Astle. Roshan Mahanama was run out at 150,
but that did not scare the Sri Lankans who had enough batting to
come.
	   New Zealand, which pulled off a thrilling last-ball win against
Zimbabwe in its first game Saturday, could not keep up with the Sri
Lankans.
	   Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka pegged wickets at regular
intervals, helped by some reckless batting by New Zealand batsmen
including openers Nathan Astle and Matthew Bell. Off-spinner
Muttiah Muralitharan took three wickets for 31 runs in his 10
overs.
	   New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming was out leg before to
Chaminda Vaas on a low delivery that cut back. The captain's
promising-looking innings ended at 23 off 26 balls.
	   Adam Parore lent some respectability to his team's score with
his 13th half century. Parore scored 57 off 87 balls including
three fours.

Taliban arrest 3 Afghan musicians in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Followers of Afghanistan's hard-line
Taliban army arrested several Afghan musicians living in a refugee
camp in remote northwestern corner of Pakistan, an Urdu-language
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The musicians had returned to an Afghan refugee camp near Wana,
not far from the border with Afghanistan, when they were arrested
late Saturday, according to the Daily Mushriq, Urdu meaning East.
	   The musicians had performed at an awards ceremony that followed
a football tournament, the newspaper reported.
	   In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, music is banned as contrary to the
tenets of Islam.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban, a harsh
brand of Islamic law has been imposed that bans most forms of light
entertainment.
	   Local Pakistani officials apparently interceded and the Taliban
were forced to release the musicians, but they confiscated their
instruments -- a set of drums called tablas and an accordion-like
instrument called a harmonium.
	   There are dozens of refugee camps throughout Pakistan's rugged
northwestern province, where more than 1.5 million Afghans still
live. At the height of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan there
were more than 5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan.
	   The Taliban have tried to impose their brand of Islamic laws on
residents of the refugee camps, where an infrastructure of schools
and prisons exist.
	   The porous border that separates Afghanistan and Pakistan makes
it easy for Taliban militia members to travel freely. Many still
have families living in refugee camps, where they try to impose
their version of Islamic law when they return to visit.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations withdrew a Chilean
member of its inspection team from Iraq on Monday after Baghdad
accused him of espionage, the chief arms monitor in Baghdad said.
	   The Chilean helicopter pilot is the second member of the U.N.
inspection commission to be withdrawn during the past two weeks.
	   The pilot, who was not identified, left Iraq for Bahrain, said
Nils Carlstrom, head of the U.N. monitoring office in Baghdad.
	   The pilot used his own camera to photograph sensitive material,
a breach of rules set by the U.N. commission, which is working to
verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq accused the pilot of spying. The U.N. commission refuted
that charge, but agreed to the pilot's withdrawal on the grounds
that he violated commission rules by using a personal camera.

Algerians accused of smuggling goods for terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three Algerians accused of trying to smuggle to
Algeria equipment to make bombs and poison are suspected members of
a militant Muslim organization, Armed Islamic Group, prosecutors
said Monday.
	   In a raid in May on the address in south London where two of the
men had been living, police turned up a cache of chemicals,
weapons, radio equipment and other materials being stored for
smuggling to Algeria for use by group, known by its French initials
GIA, in ``acts of terrorism,'' prosecutor Nigel Sweeney said.
	   Sofiane Kebilene, Farid Boukemiche and Sofiane Souidi deny
possession of the equipment, although Sweeney said Kebilene and
Boukemiche had admitted in interviews being affiliated to the
terrorist group.
	   Cans of baby food, stereo equipment and felt-tip pens were to be
used to smuggle chemicals that ``could be used for both the making
of explosives and for use in poisons to kill people,'' Sweeney
said.
	   Sweeney charged that the men made seven shipments of chemicals
and other items from Britain to Algeria between 1992 and 1997.
	   Their activities in Britain were financed by fraudulent bank
loans, credit cards and store cards, Sweeney said. By the time of
their arrest, cards and loans had been used to obtain goods and
services worth 100,000 pounds (dlrs 170,000), he said.
	   Kebilene and Souidi are in their early 30s, and Boukemiche is in
his late 20s. Prosecutors say the men were in Britain illegally.

Martin wins, but Chang is ousted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Todd Martin advanced to the second
round of the Eurocard Open, but two other Americans, Michael Chang
and Jan-Michael Gambill, lost Monday in the dlrs 2.45 million
indoor tournament.
	   Martin ousted Sebastien Lareau, a Canadian ``lucky loser'' who
was a late replacement for Marat Safin, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Safin, a Russian newcomer, pulled out with a stomach ailment.
	   Guillaume Raoux of France defeated Chang 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, and
Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic beat Gambill 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.
	   Chang, a former No. 2 in the world, showed flashes of his
trademark fighting spirit, but it wasn't enough against Raoux, who
had also beaten the American in their last meeting in the second
round of the Australian Open this year.
	   It has been a rocky year for Chang, who has dropped to No. 25 in
the current ATP computer rankings after finishing last year at No.
3.
	   After winning the title in Shanghai at the start of the month,
Chang lost in the opening round in Singapore. It was his second
straight first-round ouster in Stuttgart, which has drawn all
top-ranked men in the world.
	   A former French Open champion, Chang will not finish the year in
the top 10 for the first time since 1991.
	   Chang saved three set points against Raoux, but the Frenchman
then blasted an ace to capture the first set. Raoux won three
straight games for a 5-2 lead in the second, dropped his serve, but
broke Chang's serve at love to win the match.
	   The Stuttgart tournament is one of the last stops on the tour
before next month's World Championship and Pete Sampras is under
pressure to defend his No. 1 ranking.
	   Marcelo Rios, the No. 2 who leads the tour with seven titles
this year, and No. 3 Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open
champion, are his closest rivals, followed by No. 4 and French Open
champion Carlos Moya.
	   But Sampras also faces an unexpected challenge from Andre
Agassi, a former No. 1 who had dropped to No. 140 at this time last
year after losing interest in the game for a while.
	   But Agassi is back with a vengeance, shooting to No. 5 after
winning on Sunday in Ostrava, the Czech Republic, and he still has
a mathematical chance of regaining the No. 1 spot.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row. Like all top-seeded players, Sampras had a
first-round bye.
	   Agassi's opponent in the second round will be Andre Pavel,
another ``lucky loser'' from the qualifications who upset Paul
Haarhuis 7-5, 6-3.
	   A third ``lucky loser'' made it into the main 64-man draw when
David Nainkin took the place of injured Nicolas Escude.

Electricity company cuts power to stretch of Trans-Siberian

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional electrical company cut power Monday to
a 1,230-kilometer (765-mile) stretch of the Trans-Siberian Railway
because it says the railway hasn't paid its bill.
	   Seventy-six freight trains were stranded on the Trans-Baikal
part of the railway, a dispatcher told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Chitaenergo electrical company cut power from the Petrovsky
Zavod Station in the Chita region of eastern Siberia to the Mogocha
station.
	   ITAR-Tass said the energy company is demanding payment of an 8
million ruble (dlrs 470,000) bill.
	   Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko said the railway does not owe
any money to Chitaenergo.
	   He also said the affected stretch of the Trans-Siberian would
not have to rely on Chitaenergo, and threatened use a different
service if the supplier does not turn power back on, ITAR-Tass
reported.

Companies claim large losses caused by counterfeit goods

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Counterfeiting of goods and illegal use of
trademarks in Central and East Europe is costing multinationals
billions of dollars and jeopardizing future investment in the
region, company representatives and U.N. experts said Monday.
	   Worldwide piracy in the car parts trade alone costs the industry
some dlrs 3 billion each year, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Europe said.
	   Jeans maker Levi Strauss and motor manufacturer Ford are among
companies joining international agencies, law firms and others at a
U.N.-organized forum this week to discuss ways of helping law
enforcers in the region combat the problem.
	   The brand protection division of Levi's seized 1.5 million
illegal copies of the company's products in 1997 in the region,
division official Sandrine Besnard-Corblet told a news conference.
	   The firm's brand is among the 10 most copied in the world, she
said. In Europe, Levi's is currently pursuing legal action in 350
separate cases of suspected counterfeiting.
	   Copies of Levi's products that find their way onto the Russian
market are manufactured in Turkey and Serbia, Besnard-Corblet said.
	   Executives at motor manufacturer Ford of Europe are increasingly
concerned about the number of fake copies of its car components
flowing into Central and Eastern Europe, Kevin England, the
company's parts brand protection group manager, said.
	   Ford estimates it loses dlrs 100 million a year because of
piracy.
	   The company fears imitations of its alloy wheels, which it says
are made in Poland, are of inferior quality and potentially
dangerous, England said. Ford believes there is a link between the
counterfeiting operations and organized crime.
	   ``We look at it not just from a business point of view, but also
customer safety,'' he said.
	   Problems arise in the region because there is a huge demand for
the goods from a relatively poor population, the commission said in
a news release.
	   Police, customs and judicial authorities in most of the region's
developing economies lack experience in enforcing existing
regulations, the release said.
	   The forum is expected to set up a working party to identify
shortfalls and recommend improvements.

Nobel winners get partial standing ovation in troubled Belfast
</HEADLINE>
Assembly &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Joint Nobel Peace Prize winners
David Trimble and John Hume received a spontaneous standing ovation
from most, but not all, members of Northern Ireland's new
legislature Monday.
	   More than 20 Protestant hard-liners within the 108-member
Assembly who are opposed to April's peace accord sat on their hands
as the rest applauded Trimble and Hume, chief representatives of
the north's British Protestant and Irish Catholic communities
respectively.
	   ``This award from the world community is an extraordinary
achievement,'' declared John Alderdice, the Assembly's presiding
officer. His words brought a range of politicians to their feet _
on the Protestant side of the house Trimble's Ulster Unionists, on
the other side Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party and the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
	   But that brief unity didn't soothe the profound difficulties
facing the peace accord, which specified that the new Northern
Ireland government should hold an inaugural summit with the Irish
government by Saturday. All sides say that deadline looks certain
to be missed, since the government hasn't been appointed.
	   Hume's party deputy, Seamus Mallon, told the Assembly he felt
``a deep sense of frustration'' that the legislature's rival
politicians were failing to meet the deadline, one of few specified
in the eight-party accord.
	   Assembly members in July elected Trimble and Mallon to be the
top two figures in a new multi-party administration for Northern
Ireland.
	   But the rest of that administration, to be called the Executive,
has yet to be appointed because Protestants refuse to accept Sinn
Fein _ likely to hold two of the Executive's possible 12 seats _
unless the outlawed Irish Republican Army starts disarming first.
	   The agreement, ratified overwhelmingly in May by voters in both
parts of Ireland, called for the IRA and outlawed pro-British
groups to disarm by mid-2000. It set no specific deadline for the
Executive to be formed, although Catholic politicians argue that
this was supposed to happen before the summit deadline.
	   ``We can hold debates and pass motions, but if we want to be
taken seriously then we must face up to and solve the issues
blocking the way to the Executive,'' Mallon said, arguing that
``the will of the people has been denied'' by the delay.
	   Trimble _ whose Protestant supporters are loathe to work with
Sinn Fein so long as the IRA reserves the right to resume bombing
and shooting _ argues that he and Mallon alone could represent the
Assembly at an initial summit, since the British government doesn't
intend to hand over powers to the Executive until next year anyway.
	   But Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, backing the Catholic side
of the argument, has insisted he will hold no summit with Trimble
and Mallon unless they are leading a fully appointed Executive.

Report: cabinet opposition grows to Manchester United takeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Sports Minister Tony Banks has spoken out
against BSkyB's proposed 623-million pound (dlrs 1 billion)
takeover of Manchester United.
	   Banks, quoted in Monday's Financial Times, said there were
``concerns held across government'' about the buyout of England's
most famous soccer team by Rupert Murdoch's satellite broadcaster.
	   The governing body of English soccer _ the Football Association
_ has also come out against the deal, which has been accepted by
the United board but still needs approval from shareholders and
government regulators.
	   The Financial Times said Peter Mandelson, trade and industry
secretary, was facing growing pressure from fellow cabinet members
to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
	   Mandelson is due to receive a report next week from the Office
of Fair Trading.
	   ``As soon as football clubs become plcs (publicly listed
companies), they find themselves subject to predatory takeovers,''
Banks said. ``Yet they can't be treated like products in a
marketplace as allegiances to them are based on cultural
affinities.''
	   The paper also said there were indications that Chancellor
Gordon Brown was also concerned that Europe's largest soccer team
would be owned by BskyB, the biggest buyer of televised soccer.
	   Despite the opposition, the paper also said _ citing unnamed
sources _ that Mandelson was inclined to let the deal go through.
	   ``Manchester United, while the world's most famous football
club, is not some kind of immaculate national treasure,'' the
newspaper quoted an ally of Mandelson's as saying. ``It is a
business and is listed on the stock exchange.''

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Police freed a 3-year-old child from a kidnapper
who had grabbed the boy from his mother in a Berlin subway station
on Monday and held a knife to his chest, demanding a plane ticket.
	   The boy had minor scratches from the kidnapping, which lasted
five hours, police said. Details of the kidnapper's capture were
not immediately available. The Arabic-speaking man apparently
wanted to go to Algeria, although police described his demands as
vague.
	   Police said the man seized the boy at about noon at the
Kottbusser Tor station in the Kreuzberg district. All streets and
subway exits in the area were closed off as police negotiated with
the kidnapper.
	   A witness said the mother fell to her knees pleading with the
man to give her child back, but was ignored. She was being cared
for by police psychologists along with her husband, who arrived at
the scene later.

Daimler stock swap tops hoped-for 90 percent

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Jubilant about the success of its
stock swap, Daimler-Benz turned Monday toward preparing for what it
calls ``Day 1'' _ the transformation next month into
DaimlerChrysler, the world's biggest auto merger.
	   Daimler cleared the last significant hurdle toward setting up
the company when it announced its shareholders had swapped about 97
percent of shares for stock in the new company. The launch of
DaimlerChrysler on the stock market _ or ``Day 1'' _ will now most
likely be in the week starting Nov. 15, depending on how quickly
Daimler dispenses with some legal details.
	   ``We have a deal, that's certain. The rest is really a
formality,'' Daimler spokesman Roland Klein said Monday.
	   For the mega-merger to go ahead, 75 percent of Daimler's shares
needed to be swapped for shares in the new company. That goal was
never in doubt, as 80 percent of Daimler's 800,000 shareholders are
institutions which supported the deal. The other 20 percent are
individuals, four of whom have filed lawsuits against Daimler
opposing the merger.
	   The 90-percent mark was more crucial. Crossing it means Daimler
avoids a tax hit on its so-called ``goodwill assets,'' or
money-earning intangibles such as its good name and high-quality
reputation.
	   To encourage the stock swap, Daimler promised stockholders one
additional share for every 200 shares they hold in the new company,
a deal that helped achieve what Daimler's Chief Financial Officer
Manfred Gentz called ``the best result ever reached in a voluntary
stock swap offer worldwide.''
	   The share swap capped six months of preparation for the merger,
which will produce a company worth about dlrs 32.5 billion. It also
will have an aerospace unit, to be called DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace, or Dasa.
	   The final steps of the merger were up to Daimler, with a note of
drama creeping in when the four shareholders launched legal
challenges over the last two weeks in a Stuttgart court.
	   They said Daimler hadn't given enough information about the
deal, and that the merger would dilute Daimler's international
reputation.
	   ``Outside of the United States, Chrysler is a no-name firm,''
said Jochen Knoesel, chairman of a group pressing for greater
company transparency for German shareholders, which is representing
the plaintiffs.
	   The challenges are ongoing but won't delay the merger, Daimler's
Gentz said. He dismissed them as ``noisy and polemical campaigns.''
	   Daimler has extended the stock-swap offer by two weeks, until
Nov. 6, to comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
rules. The extension is required because the bonus shares have
altered the original stock-swap ratio of the merger, Daimler said.
	   Clearing the 90-percent hurdle means Daimler-Chrysler can use
the ``pooling-of-interests'' accounting method, which is popular in
U.S. mergers, allowing them to avoid a dlrs 26 billion hit on net
income that would have been generated if the deal was an outright
purchase of one company by the other. This is how Daimler avoids
paying taxes on its ``goodwill assets.''
	   However, Daimler stressed that DaimlerChrysler will only be able
to use the profit-friendly accounting method if Chrysler issues 30
million shares out of its own share-buyback program. The new shares
would be put into Chrysler's pension fund.

Serb troop movements as NATO measures compliance with peace deal

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day before NATO's latest deadline,
tanks and armored vehicles rumbled back to barracks Monday in
Kosovo, as the Yugoslav government sought to convince the Alliance
it is complying with demands to avoid airstrikes.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed Alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
remove more troops from front lines.
	   In an apparent sign of compliance, a NATO official, speaking to
reporters on condition of anonymity, said intelligence reports show
``some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal.''
	   Still, he said, NATO remains was ready to use military force
once a deadline for compliance runs out at 1900 gmt Tuesday. The
deadline was already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a
peace plan Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return safely to their homes.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province, part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Kosovo, a convoy of more than two dozen Yugoslav tanks,
trucks and other armored vehicles was seen Monday rolling through
the Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, but the
policemen manning the small house at the intersection remained on
duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled,
or if police would continue to monitor traffic there.
	   The government's Serb Media Center said three military units
were returning to their barracks in Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President
Clinton was monitoring developments. ``There appears to be a lot of
movement'' of Serb troops, Lockhart said, adding, ``We haven't seen
enough'' pullbacks.
	   ``We're going to wait until the dust settles'' to judge whether
Milosevic is in compliance with NATO demands, he said.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the NATO ambassadors would probably wait until shortly before
Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic has met the
conditions.

Arena to coach U.S. soccer team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Four months after the United States plunged to a
last-place finish at the World Cup, Bruce Arena will become coach
of the American national team.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation scheduled a Tuesday news conference
in New York to announce a new coach. A federation official,
speaking on the condition he not be identified, confirmed Arena as
the choice.
	   Arena replaces Steve Sampson, who resigned June 29, four days
after the U.S. team completed an 0-3 World Cup. Arena led D.C.
United to Major League Soccer championships in 1996 and 1997, but
D.C. United lost to the Chicago Fire 2-0 Sunday in this year's
final.
	   The hiring of the 47-year-old coach has been expected since
mid-August but there was no urgency for the USSF to complete its
decision since the United States had no games between the World Cup
and an exhibition against Australia on Nov. 6 at San Jose,
California.
	   Arena is expected to try out young players until the autumn of
2000, when the United States begins qualifying for the 2002 World
Cup. The next tournament for the Americans is in January, when they
play Brazil, New Zealand and an undetermined European team at the
FIFA Confederations Cup at Guadalajara, Mexico. Brazil is not
expected to bring its first-team players.

Istanbul's mayor resigns from Islamic party as jailing approaches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's mayor, due to start serving a
10-month prison term soon for allegedly inciting religious hatred,
announced his resignation Monday from Turkey's Islamic party.
	   Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move was seen as an attempt to spare his
party's reputation any damage from having one of its leading
figures in jail.
	   Erdogan, the first Islamic-oriented mayor of Turkey's largest
city and a rising star of the Welfare Party, was sentenced in
September for reading aloud a stridently Islamic poem at a rally.
	   His prosecution was seen as the latest in a series of setbacks
that Turkey's secular establishment has dealt the nation's Islamic
movement.
	   A forerunner of the Welfare Party was closed down earlier this
year as an alleged threat to Turkey's secular principles. The
leader of that party, former premier Necmettin Erbakan. was banned
from politics for five years.
	   Erdogan, elected to lead Istanbul's in March 1994, is expected
to be forced out of his seat as mayor and be imprisoned in coming
months. No date has been set.

Belfast army base to be closed down in peace move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ One of the British army's
biggest bases in Northern Ireland will be dismantled as part of
peacemaking efforts, officials announced Monday.
	   The commander of the police force, Chief Constable Ronnie
Flanagan, said Fort Whiterock overlooking Catholic west Belfast
will be dismantled within the next few months in expectation that
his forces will no longer require so many troops garrisoned in the
area.
	   Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, called the
move ``further evidence of the commitment given in the Belfast
agreement to bring about a more normal security environment across
Northern Ireland. This is a significant step towards achieving that
goal and one which I know will be widely welcomed.''
	   Built in 1979, Fort Whiterock sits on a hillside overlooking
Catholic public-housing projects where support for the outlawed
Irish Republican Army runs high.
	   It has been subjected to sporadic gun and bomb attacks over the
years, although army engineers have responded by erecting
ever-higher corrugated iron walls and elaborate armored
watchtowers. IRA gunmen shot at the massive base in July 1997,
riddling its outer walls but wounding nobody, just days before
calling their current cease-fire.
	   During the IRA's previous 17-month cease-fire that collapsed in
1996, British authorities declined to dismantle all but a handful
of army installations, citing fears that they would just have to be
re-erected.
	   But April's peace agreement called for gradual disarmament by
Northern Ireland's rival outlawed groups and for gradual
``demilitarization'' by the legal forces of law and order.
	   Since then the army has withdrawn two battalions of troops,
although more than 16,000 remain, several thousand of them locally
recruited Protestants. It has also stopped foot patrols in most
parts of Northern Ireland and dismantled some fortifications along
the province's border with the Irish Republic.

Christie's may cancel auction of Archimedes manuscript

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The New York auctioneer scheduled to sell
the only known copy of text by ancient Greek scientist Archimedes
may call off this week's auction because of ownership claims by
Greek orthodox clerics, Christie's auction house said Monday.
	   Felix de Marez Oyens, head of Christie's Book and Manuscripts
Department, said his company is satisfied that the French family
who obtained the manuscript in the 1920s is the rightful owner and
is entitled to sell it Thursday in New York.
	   But the auction house fears the manuscript's price could sink
because of publicity over the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate's claims
that the 1,000-year-old document was stolen earlier this century
from its library in Constantinople _ present-day Istanbul, de Marez
Oyens said.
	   ``If we are allowed to hold the sale and the (Patriarchate's)
claim is unsuccessful _ as we think it will be _ we may still
decide together with the consignor not to have the sale,'' de Marez
Oyens said.
	   The 174-leaf text, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest,
originally was expected to go for between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2
million.
	   It is the only known copy of original notes and calculations by
the 3rd century BC theoretician and inventor, who explored the
movements of the stars and is credited with devising the compound
pulley and devices for raising water.
	   De Marez Oyens said the Patriarchate's claim ``appears to us, at
best, to be a belated renunciation of actions taken by their own
representatives in Constantinople many decades ago, in
circumstances where apparently no detailed records were kept.''
	   A final decision on the sale may not be made until Wednesday, de
Marez Oyens said.
	   The Patriarchate, through its lawyer in New York, has threatened
legal action if the manuscript is not handed over. The Patriarchate
would give the text to Athens' National Library, Greek officials
have said.
	   Many Greeks see the text as part of their cultural heritage.
Officials have appealed to Greek institutions to pool their funds
to try to win the bidding, if the auction goes forward.
	   Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the ``concealment'' of
the manuscript in private hands has been ``a crime against the
world scientific and intellectual reserves.''
	   De Marez Oyens said Christie's also wants to see the document
exhibited publicly in Greece and that it would be a shame if the
sale is called off, thus guaranteeing that it would revert to
private hands for now.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who has been reduced to a part-time
president in recent months, was ailing again Monday and canceled
yet another foreign trip, this time to recuperate from high-blood
pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health is a source of daily speculation, and a
growing chorus of critics questions his fitness to guide Russia
through its worst economic crisis in the post-Soviet era.
	   The president's doctors ordered Yeltsin not to make a one-day
trip to Austria on Tuesday because he was suffering from an
``asthenic condition,'' that makes him very weak, both physically
and emotionally, the president's office said.
	   Asthenia refers to a lack of bodily strength. Yeltsin's blood
pressure was also unstable, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said, adding that doctors recommended a vacation for the president.
	   Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev said the president would likely start
a vacation Wednesday. He said Yeltsin would probably stay near
Moscow.
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable to
work,'' Sysuyev said on the Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``It was very difficult for the president to cancel this
visit,'' he said. ``This is perhaps the first time recently when
the president has listened to his doctors' advice.''
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will make the trip to Vienna for
talks with the European Union instead.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign _ and he insists he won't _ he would
be replaced temporarily by Primakov, who would be required to call
new elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister only six weeks and has yet to
produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's spokesman expressed
confidence Monday that Yeltsin's health setback would not delay
steps to resolve Russia's economic crisis.
	   ``We wish him a speedy recovery,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said.

Argentina's ``superclasico'' disappoints ; Six Brazilian teams
</HEADLINE>
advance &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The ``Superclasico'' _ or
Superclassic - between Argentina's two most popular teams turned
out to be anything but.
	   The usual backdrop was there: thousands of fans jammed into a
Buenos Aires stadium, streets deserted at game time, and crowds
gathered around television sets in corner cafes.
	   Only one thing was missing: action.
	   Sunday's celebration and intense rivalry weren't enough as River
Plate and Boca Juniors played to a 0-0 draw. The ``Super Zero'' it
was later dubbed by La Nacion, a local paper.
	   River's Marcelo Gallardo had the best opportunity to shake
things up in the 44th minute, but the gifted playmaker took the
chance too lightly.
	   Slowly walking up to his penalty kick, Gallardo left enough time
for Boca's Oscar Cordoba to lunge to his left and knock the ball
away.
	   Few other chances followed for either team.
	   Despite the tie, Boca still leads the standings with 28 points,
followed by Gimnasia La Plata with 24 and Racing with 21.
	   In Brazil, Corinthians moved into the league's top spot with 2-1
victory over Sao Paulo Saturday. But not all is well.
	   Manager Wanderely Luxemburgo and star striker, Marcelinho,
clashed again. The forward, who has netted 15 goals so far this
year, was dropped from the game's lineup for disciplinary reasons.
Neither Luxemburgo or Marcelinho explained why.
	   Sitting one point behind Corinthians, Coritiba has been the
season's biggest surprise, although Atletico-MG held them to 1-1
tie on Saturday.
	   After this weekend's action, six teams have qualified for the
league's next round of play: Corinthians, Coritiba, Palmeiras,
Sport, Santos and Portguesa,
	   Seven teams are battling for the final two spots.
	   Among the chasers are Rio's top clubs: Flamengo, who beat
Guarani 2-1, and Vasco da Gama, who lost 1-0 to Vitoria.
	   Flamengo, scoring twice in the 46th minute, moved ahead of Vasco
but needs to win their next two games, and hope other teams slip
up, to reach the second stage.
	   Sunday's state elections pushed all match play back to Saturday.
	   In Chile, a fortunate slip Sunday helped Universidad de Chile
stay close to league-leading Colo Colo.
	   Down 1-0 to Puerta Montt, Universidad got a lucky break when
Flavio Maestri fell down while attacking in Montt's goal area.
Referees had a bad angle on the play and ruled a penalty kick to
help Universidad to a 1-1 draw.
	   It wasn't Universidad's only good luck that day. Colo Colo, at
home, lost 2-1 to modest Audax Italiano.
	   Colo's lead over Universidad is now down to four points.

German carmaker reports net profit up 77 percent in first nine months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen announced Monday its profits rose 77
percent in the first nine months of the year to 1.51 billion marks (dlrs
920.7 million).
	   The three-quarter result was up from 852 million marks (dlrs 519.5
million) the same period last year, a company statement said.
	   The automaker attributed the increase to stronger domestic demand within
Europe, saying that low inflation and some improvement in the job market had
led to ``tentative revival in private consumption.''
	   ``Barring the effect of the economic crisis in Brazil, South Africa and
Japan, we continue to expect a positive result for the last quarter and with
that, a gain for 1998 above the previous year,'' the company said.
	   While worldwide unit sales for Volkswagen rose 10.9 percent to 3.53
million cars in the first nine months compared to the same period last year,
unit sales were down at VW's Brazil and Asia-Pacific units.

Dane gives dead dad a last journey on motorbike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish man wanted to have one last
outing with his dad, so he took him for a motorcycle ride _ even
though the father had died two days earler, police said Monday.
	   Flemming Petersen, 36, went to the morgue in Frederikssund, 40
kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Copenhagen on Saturday, dressed
his father's corpse in leather motorcyle gear and smuggled it out
to his bike, where he strapped the body onto the passenger seat,
police said.
	   Several hours later, he ended the farewell journey by going to
the Frederikssund police station and turning himself in. He was
charged with indecent handling of a corpse, but was not detained.
	   The newspaper B.T. reported Monday that the ride included a
stopoff at a Copenhagen bar, where Petersen propped up the body in
a seat, stuck a cigar in its mouth, ordered a couple of beers and
had a one-sided chat.
	   Police said they could not confirm that incident and the
newspaper did not give the name of the bar.
	   ``I really felt great afterwards. It helps to be with the
deceased, to sit and chat although he couldn't hear what I was
saying,'' the newspaper quoted Petersen as saying.
	   The newspaper said that at one point during the nearly four-hour
ride, the bike stalled and Petersen asked a passerby to help push,
explaining that his father ``had a couple of beers and was dead
tired.''
	   Petersen also reportedly stopped by his mother in Frederikssund
and took a few snapshots of the father on the bike before turning
himself in.

Youth violence causes new transit strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 8th with transit workers ending strike in Lille &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers continued strike action in several
cities on Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation across France.
	   The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille,
Lille, Caen and Chambery, officials said.
	   The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the
west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a
train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on
Sunday.
	   A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a fire
extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the driver to
be hospitalized. On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45
minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
	   Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the
southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout,
officials said. The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked
on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
	   The workers voted to end their job action Monday afternoon.
	   Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille
bus drivers, who also began returning to work Monday. But employee
representatives said they would halt service after each attack in
France's second-largest city.
	   There was some respite for commuters in Lille _ France's
fourth-largest metropolis _ where bus and tram workers voted Monday
to end a six-day strike after employers pledged tighter security
measures. Services were expected to be back to normal by Tuesday.
	   Elsewhere, a strike in the Alpine city of Chambery stretched
into its 10th day.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations withdrew a Chilean
member of its weapons inspection team on Monday after he was
accused of espionage, the chief arms monitor in Baghdad said.
	   The Chilean helicopter pilot is the second member of the U.N.
team to be withdrawn during the past two weeks.
	   The pilot, who was not identified, left Iraq for Bahrain, said
Nils Carlstrom, head of the U.N. monitoring office in Baghdad.
	   The pilot used his own camera to photograph sensitive material,
a breach of rules set by the U.N. commission, which is working to
verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq accused the pilot of spying. The U.N. commission denied
that charge, but agreed to the pilot's withdrawal on the grounds
that he violated rules by using a personal camera.

WBC chief denounces proliferation of boxing bodies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD details of meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ There are too many boxing
organizations, and not enough of them are acting in the best
interests of the sport, says World Boxing Council president Jose
Sulaiman.
	   Speaking Monday at the opening of the WBC's annual convention,
Sulaiman said he would like to combat that. To start, promoters are
being asked to consider an agreement to unify rules with the World
Boxing Association.
	   The agreement _ hammered out by the WBC and the WBA in a meeting
in Mexico City last April _ is aimed at standardizing the names of
weight categories, the awarding of points and procedures for drug
testing. An agreement could eventually result in only one champion
in each weight category.
	   Sulaiman urged an investigation into international boxing
organizations, saying they must prove the validity of their alleged
world status.
	   If action was not taken soon, ``boxing will die in 50 years, and
will become merely a circus,'' he said.
	   Major boxing bodies include the WBC, the WBA, the International
Boxing Federation and the World Boxing Organization.
	   ``It is time to stop deceiving the boxing fans of the world,''
said Sulaiman, opening the annual WBC convention in Johannesburg in
front of a gathering which included President Nelson Mandela,
himself a former amateur boxer.
	   ``Most of these champions, with all due respect, are not
champions of the world,'' Sulaiman said. ``Those organizations are
selling to the people a lie, and to sell a lie is nothing but a
fraud.
	   ``Let us stop it for the sake of credibility, for the sake of
the respect that the sport of boxing deserves.''
	   In an emotion-charged speech paying tribute to Mandela and
emphasizing the WBC's role in condemning apartheid over the years,
Sulaiman also urged the establishment of a fund so boxing could
provide pensions ``for our heroes of the past.''
	   He had learned Monday of the plight of former boxers Alphonse
Halimi of Algeria and Lote Mwale of Zambia, both of whom have
financial problems.
	   The WBC would give both monthly pensions, he said, but more had
to be done for the many ex-boxers in a similar situation.
	   Sulaiman said he would propose this week that new championships
should be launched for boxers of 21 and younger.
	   The goal would be to give young fighters something to aim at,
and obviate the need to take on old fighters before they were
mature, ``and overcome professional sharks who have stopped and
hurt so many young boxers, paying them peanuts.''
	   Sulaiman also presented Mandela with the WBC's Award of Human
Dignity and a championship belt.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who has been reduced to a part-time
president in recent months, was ailing again Monday and canceled
yet another foreign trip, this time to recuperate from high-blood
pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's fragile health is a source of daily speculation, and a
growing chorus of critics questions his fitness to guide Russia
through its worst economic crisis in the post-Soviet era.
	   The president's doctors ordered Yeltsin not to make a one-day
trip to Austria on Tuesday because he was suffering from an
``asthenic condition,'' that makes him very weak, both physically
and emotionally, the president's office said.
	   Asthenia refers to a lack of bodily strength. Yeltsin's blood
pressure was also unstable, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said, adding that doctors recommended a vacation for the president.
	   ``I think everything will be fine with'' Yeltsin, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told Associated Press Television on Monday. ``I
will meet with the president tomorrow morning.''
	   Primakov will make the trip to Vienna for talks with the
European Union instead.
	   Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev said the president would likely start
a two-week vacation Wednesday. He said Yeltsin would probably stay
near Moscow.
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable to
work,'' Sysuyev said on the Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``It was very difficult for the president to cancel this
visit,'' he said. ``This is perhaps the first time recently when
the president has listened to his doctors' advice.''

Israeli radio: Peace deal to cost Israel dlrs 250 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It will cost Israel an estimated dlrs 250
million to carry out the West Bank troop redeployment it committed
to under the latest Mideast peace deal, Israel radio reported
Monday.
	   Down from earlier estimates of dlrs 1 billion to fulfill
security arrangements in the agreement, the lower figure had a
better chance of being approved by the U.S. Congress.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged to provide Israel with a
security aid package as part of the agreement signed at the White
House last week.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon met with his staff Monday
to prepare for a meeting next week in Washington with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeline Albright to settle a figure package.
	   Most spending will cover additional security for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, according to the radio. Many
settlements will be left surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas
after the redeployment is completed.
	   Other costs include paving ten bypass roads for settlers and
evacuating ten military camps, the radio reported.
	   Israel already receives about dlrs 3 billion in economic and
military aid from the United States annually. Congress must approve
any new spending packages for Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said following the summit that he expects both himself
and Clinton to lobby lawmakers for the money.
	   Israeli military and foreign ministry officials are now
assessing how much aid will be needed, Netanyahu's office said.

Three killed in Czech helicopter crash in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Czech military helicopter
crashed into a hillside above a remote field in northwest Bosnia,
killing the three peacekeepers aboard, Czech military officials
said Monday.
	   The Czech Mi-17 helicopter disappeared late Sunday while on a
routine flight from Gornji Vakuf in northwestern Bosnia to the
Croatian port of Split; British helicopters found the wreckage
Monday at Tomislavgrad, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of
Sarajevo.
	   No rescue teams were immediately able to reach the crash site,
but Czech military officials confirmed that the three crew members
were killed.
	   Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, said it
was still too early to say what caused the crash. Local officials
said there had been heavy rain in the area.
	   The crew members were based in the northwestern town of Velika
Kladusa, as part of the 36,000-strong force of multinational
peacekeepers for Bosnia.
	   Since NATO deployed the peace force three years ago, 86 members
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic
accidents or land-mine blasts.

Workers remove barricade at Volvo plant in Nova Scotia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Volvo employees removed barricades
Monday and and resumed work for the first time since shutting down
their factory Wednesday in a dispute over severance packages to be
offered when the plant closes for good in December.
	   About 30 workers took over the plant last week, staging a work
stoppage and blockade in an effort to demand better severance
packages. Volvo plans to shut down the car assembly plant Dec. 18,
putting more than 200 people out of work.
	   Over the weekend, company and union negotiators reached a
tentative agreement on revisions in the severance packages.
	   Details of the deal were not being released until the workers
vote on the offer.
	   The company's previous severance package offered workers two
weeks' severance per year of service up to 40 weeks and a maximum
of dlrs 35,000 (about dlrs 22,500 U.S.). It discontinued health
coverage for workers who take their severance in a lump sum instead
of weekly payments.

Women have spread their genes more than men
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The history books are full of the adventurous
travels of men, but a new study suggests that women have done
better at spreading their genes around the globe.
	   That doesn't mean historians have overlooked voyages by women
explorers. For the most part, researchers say, the explanation is
much more mundane: Women through history moved to their mates'
communities to start families.
	   Over thousands of years, these short migrations apparently
enabled women's genes get around more than men's, said researcher
Mark Seielstad.
	   Seielstad, a fellow in the program for population genetics at
the Harvard School of Public Health, did the work with L. Luca
Cavalli-Sforza and Eric Minch at the Stanford University School of
Medicine. Their findings were published in the November issue of
the journal Nature Genetics.
	   Another genetics expert said he suspects there's more to the
story.
	   The study used data on modern-day genes. It looked for the
effects of men and women moving away from their native communities
in ancient times and producing children somewhere else.
	   It relied on the fact that the Y chromosome is passed on only by
fathers. In contrast, genetic material called mitochondrial DNA, or
mtDNA, is passed along only by mothers.
	   Both kinds of genetic material contain tiny variations that can
be tracked in different populations. The more a specific variation
is confined to a particular population, the less chance it has had
to spread elsewhere through human migration.
	   The researchers found that Y chromosome variations tended to be
much more localized than mtDNA variations _ a sign that men weren't
migrating as much as women. The difference showed up when different
populations on a single continent were compared, as well as in
comparisons between inhabited continents.
	   The biggest reason is probably women moving to their husbands'
communities to start families, the researchers said. A smaller
factor might be men with multiple wives, which would also suppress
variation in Y chromosomes, but very few men have been able to
afford that arrangement, the researchers said.
	   Seielstad said he and colleagues weren't surprised by the
result, because the idea of women moving to their husbands'
community is so common across cultures.
	   Michael Hammer, a University of Arizona geneticist, said that
Seielstad's conclusions make sense but that his own work suggests
an additional twist.
	   Hammer's genetic evidence agrees that women may have migrated
more than men within continents. But between continents, it appears
that occasional long-distance migrations by men have let them
spread their genes more than women, he said.

Russian fleet's debts prompt threats of electricity cutoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ Russian sailors stationed in
Ukraine's Black Sea port of Sevastopol might soon find themselves
living like their World War II predecessors _ or at least cooking
like them.
	   Russia's Black Sea fleet command recently has ordered its units
to take camp stoves out of warehouses where some have been stored
since the late 1940's, to use them for cooking food, fleet
officials said Monday.
	   The order wasn't meant to create wartime conditions for the
sailors to better practice their skills. It came in response to
persistent warnings from Sevastopol's government that it would cut
off electricity and heat to its debtors. The bulky camp stoves need
neither, instead using coal and wood for fuel.
	   Russia rents naval bases in Sevastopol, a mostly ethnic Russian
city on the Crimean peninsula, under a 1996 deal on dividing the
former Soviet Black Sea Fleet. The status of Sevastopol _ which
Russian nationalists argue should belong to Russia _ has spoiled
relations between the two countries since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Now, it seems, another round of tensions is in the making.
	   The once-powerful fleet, which Russia's cash-strapped government
can no longer finance in full, has turned into Sevastopol's largest
debtor, owing more than 10.6 million hryvna (dlrs 3 million) for
electricity, water and heat, city authorities say.
	   The city government is in poor financial straits, and fleet
commander Vladimir Komoedov's desperate appeals not to cut off
electricity and other services to the fleet have met little
sympathy.
	   Komoedov recently sent an angry letter to Sevastopol Mayor Borys
Kucher in which he complained about threats by city tax officials
to confiscate some fleet properties and warned of the danger of
leaving ammunition warehouses poorly guarded without regular
electricity supplies.
	   ``Such activities threaten the friendly relations between
Sevastopol and the Russian fleet, as well as the ties between our
two brotherly nations,'' Komoedov wrote in his letter.
	   The mayor denies that any politics are involved in the threats
to cut off electricity.
	   ``Implementation of our obligations to the Russian fleet depends
directly on its repaying the debt,'' Kucher wrote in response to
the Russian commander.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's mayor, due to start serving a
10-month prison term soon for allegedly inciting religious hatred,
announced his resignation Monday from Turkey's Islamic party.
	   Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move was seen as an attempt to spare his
party's reputation any damage from having one of its leading
figures in jail.
	   Erdogan, the first Islamic-oriented mayor of Turkey's largest
city and a rising star of the Virtue Party, was sentenced in
September for reading aloud a stridently Islamic poem at a rally.
	   His prosecution was the latest in a series of setbacks that
Turkey's secular establishment has dealt the nation's Islamic
movement.
	   A forerunner of the Virtue Party was closed down earlier this
year as an alleged threat to Turkey's secular principles. The
leader of that party, former premier Necmettin Erbakan. was banned
from politics for five years.
	   Erdogan, elected to lead Istanbul's in March 1994, is expected
to be forced out of his seat as mayor and be imprisoned in coming
months. No date has been set.

Gascoigne out of rehab, promises no more drinking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: STANDS for story slugged Gazza Returns on digest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Troubled midfielder Paul Gascoigne
rejoined Middlesbrough on Monday, just 16 days after checking into
a clinic for treatment of stress, depression and alcohol problems.
	   Appearing at a news conference alongside manager Bryan Robson,
the former England star said he would stop drinking and try to cope
better with the off-the-field pressures that have burdened him
throughout his career.
	   The 31-year-old ``Gazza,'' one of the most scrutinized
personalities in Britain, was admitted to the rehabilitation clinic
after a series of drunken incidents that were widely reported in
British newspapers.
	   ``It wasn't just the drinking,'' he said Monday. ``It was
everything. Depressed. Stress. ... I thought it would be in the
best interest that I get away. I went to the hospital where I could
sort everything out. I feel better for it.''
	   Asked whether the treatment included admitting he was an
alcoholic, Gascoigne said, ``I'm not going to go into that.''
	   But he did say, ``I have decided to stop drinking. It is
important to keep off the drink.''
	   Asked whether he was a changed man, he said, ``I'll let you
decide that.''
	   When Gascoigne was admitted to the clinic, there was speculation
he could be in treatment for up to six months. Many were surprised
that he was returning to the club after just two weeks.
	   But Robson said the doctors who treated Gascoigne felt he was
ready to rejoin the club while continuing his treatment.
	   Robson said Gascoigne would return to the hospital ``a couple of
days a week'' for ongoing treatment for the next month.
	   ``The medical people are delighted with the intense work he put
in,'' Robson said. ``They said he was an excellent patient, and has
come on in leaps and bounds.''
	   Robson said Gascoigne trained with the club Monday morning and
``looked good.''
	   The manager said he would assess Gazza's fitness during the week
and would consider using him in Sunday's Premier League game
against Nottingham Forest.
	   Gascoigne, who said he kept fit during his hospital stay by
playing in five-a-side games, denied that he had been ``led
astray'' by his entourage of night-clubbing, celebrity friends.
	   ``I just thought I was going onto the pitch with a lot of
problems I should have coped with better,'' he said.
	   Gazza thanked Robson for his support as well as Paul Merson, the
Aston Villa and former Middlesbrough midfielder who underwent
treatment for alcoholism.
	   Robson said Gascoigne was free to choose his own friends but
should learn to handle himself better and not be influenced by
others.
	   ``He is going to have to change his lifestyle to a certain
extent,'' Robson said. ``But that doesn't mean he can't enjoy
himself.''
	   Gascoigne fended off questions about his future with the England
team, saying he was only concentrating on getting back into the
'Boro lineup. He also declined to comment on England coach Glenn
Hoddle, who dropped him from the team on the eve of last summer's
World Cup for being ``unfit.''
	   His axing followed reports of his drunken behavior in nightclubs
in England and Spain in the leadup to tournament.
	   In his World Cup diary, Hoddle said Gascoigne went beserk and
smashed up a hotel room when he was given the news of his axing.
	   In the meantime, one of the player's closest friends died after
a night out with Gascoigne and his stormy two-year marriage ended
when his wife Sheryl was granted a ``quickie'' divorce on the
grounds of what was described as his unreasonable behavior.

 &UR; Arafat in Saudi Arabia to rally support for peace accord &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
flew to Saudi Arabia on Monday to drum up support for his accord
with Israel and said the deal was the ``utmost we could get at this
time.''
	   The agreement calls for further Israeli withdrawals from the
West Bank and a Palestinian crackdown on militants to prevent
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``What we got ... is considered the utmost we could get at this
time,'' Arafat told The Associated Press after he arrived in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Earlier, Saudi King Fahd said the agreement ``should be the
launching pad for a new phase of just and comprehensive peace for
all the countries of the region.''
	   In Cairo on Sunday, Arafat said he hoped the new
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be ``accurately and
faithfully'' implemented.
	   His comment reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to withdraw from a
further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   In addition to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Arafat has also visited
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to rally support for the accord.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.

UNITED NATIONS: French labs.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The French tests were conducted late this summer after a U.S.
laboratory reported finding traces of the deadly nerve agent VX on
fragments of missile warheads in June. The U.S. finding countered
Iraqi claims that it was never able to make enough VX, or stabilize
it properly, to load into missiles.
	   The report didn't say that VX was found in any of the new tests,
saying only that ``The French laboratory reported the presence of a
degradation product of a nerve agent,'' in one sample. The report
noted that French experts said this product could also originate
from other compounds.
	   However, both the Swiss and the French laboratories found
chemicals known to be degradation products of a decontamination
compound, the report said.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which carries out inspections in
Iraq, suggested in the report that Iraq explain what happened to
the fragments that were analyzed and why degradation products of
nerve agents were found on some.

Pinochet's lawyers argue in court his arrest was illegal

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Urging the High Court to order Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's immediate release, his lawyers said Monday that
extraditing the former Chilean dictator to Spain to face charges of
murder, torture and kidnap would be like sending Queen Elizabeth II
to be tried in Argentina for soldiers' deaths in the 1982 Falkland
Islands war.
	   However, a Spanish magistrate has issued a new extradition
warrant to cover an unspecified number of murders, tortures and
kidnappings up to 1992, two years after Pinochet's 17-year rule
ended, the court heard.
	   Lawyers opposing his release gave no detailed explanation for
the new warrant, but said evidence was building up all the time
against Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed in a London
hospital on a Spanish warrant citing 94 victims, including
Spaniards, and lawyers said later it could be broadened to include
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared after he seized
power.
	   Also Monday, Geneva state authorities added to legal pressure to
keep Pinochet in Europe by setting in motion an application for
extradition over the 1977 disappearance of Alexis Jaccard, a
student with dual Swiss-Chilean citizenship.
	   With Pinochet, who underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9, still in the
expensive London Clinic under police guard, Chile's deputy foreign
minister appealed to Britain to release him on humanitarian
grounds.
	   ``He is ill, (and) in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano
Fernandez told reporters in London.
	   In the High Court, dozens of Chilean exiles watched Pinochet's
lawyers argue that ex-heads of state have immunity from prosecution
for acts committed in an ``official capacity.''
	   Alun Jones, representing British and Spanish prosecutors and the
British police, countered that ``the official functions of the
president of Chile do not include the systematic torture and
elimination of political opponents.''
	   Nicholls said that to deny Pinochet immunity opened the prospect
of the queen on a visit to the United States being extradited to
Argentina over deaths of Argentine soldiers in the war with Britain
over the Falkland Islands which claimed some 1,000 lives.
	   ``That (granting Pinochet immunity) does not raise the specter
of a future Hitler going unpunished,'' said Nicholls, maintaining
that international tribunals can still apply to try such people.
	   Nicholls said extradition warrant was also invalid because
Pinochet is not Spanish.
	   The hearing was expected to last through part of Tuesday.
	   At Brize Norton, a Royal Air Force base northwest of London, a
Chilean military aircraft with medical personnel and equipment was
on standby to take the general home if he wins the case.
	   In Santiago, Chilean air force sources said the Gulfstream jet
was bought from the United States and had been used by Gen. Norman
Schwarkzkopf, the U.S. commander, during Gulf War.
	   The new Spanish warrant, issued late last week, asserted that
Pinochet was responsible for murders between January 1976 and
December 1992, torture between 1988 and 1992 and kidnappings
between 1982 and 1992. Numbers and nationalities of the victims
were not given.
	   Jones, opposing release, said Pinochet stands accused of killing
4,000 people _ and the warrant could be amended further.
	   ``Fresh information is coming all the time,'' Jones told the
court.
	   Britain's Labor Party government said Pinochet, a regular
visitor to Britain, does not have diplomatic immunity, and it
cannot intervene in a legal issue.

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba made an
impassioned plea for peace in the embattled Congo on Monday as he
opened a meeting of African defense and foreign ministers aimed at
ending the war.
	   ``You stand at the cutting edge, a defining moment ... to
determine whether Africa has got the political will and
determination to end the war in the Congo,'' Chiluba said.
	   The talks went into recess late Monday and officials said they
would resume and would likely continue through the night or
reconvene Tuesday.
	   The goal was to wrap up an agreement for an immediate ceasefire
in the Congo conflict, officials said.
	   ``All of us are looking forward to this meeting agreeing on a
cease-fire. Indications are that we are ready to sit up late into
the night and if need be up to tomorrow to get this thing done,''
said a South African official who asked not to be identified.
	   The talks were being held behind a veil of secrecy, with little
information on the negotiations being made available.
	   A delegation of rebel leaders was led by former Congolese
Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha, but the rebels were not allowed to
directly participate in the talks and were instead briefed on
developments by Zambian officials.
	   Embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila insists the rebels
are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, countries he accuses of backing
the rebels with invading forces.
	   ``To ask us to talk to those people would be very dangerous
because the real rebels are Rwanda and Uganda,'' Kabila's Foreign
Minister Jean Charles Okoto told reporters. Kabila himself was not
in Lusaka.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In convoys of rumbling tanks and
trucks, Yugoslav troops and Serb police on Monday vacated some
heavily fortified positions in Kosovo on the eve of a NATO deadline
to comply with a peace agreement or face punishing air strikes.
	   The withdrawal was President Slobodan Milosevic's 11th-hour
attempt to convince NATO he was fulfilling the agreement he reached
two weeks ago with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the
eight-month Kosovo conflict.
	   Throughout the day, lines of green army tanks, artillery trucks
and blue police armored vehicles were seen moving toward military
and police barracks in Pristina, the provincial capital, and other
cities.
	   In the Drenica region 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina,
a steady drizzle filled freshly gouged tracks made by tanks
withdrawing from roadside positions they assumed Oct. 18.
	   Several police checkpoints were vacant, including one in
Malisevo _ the last front line in fighting that virtually halted
last month. All that remained was a tattered Yugoslav flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another check point in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   ``There's a minefield around so we came to check the situation
to see if civilians can come back,'' the guerrilla said. He refused
to give his name.
	   Police remained at a few check points in the area as dusk
settled, and there was no indication that any people had returned
to their heavily damaged villages nearby.
	   Ethnic Albanians who fled during the Serb offensive that began
Feb. 28 say they'll only come home once all police and soldiers
have left. The return of an estimated 300,000 refugees, including
up to 10,000 believed living in the woods, is a key provision of
the Holbrook-Milosevic plan.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed Alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he told Milosevic to remove more troops from front
lines.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown on the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting
for independence for the province from Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there
appeared to be ``a lot of movement,'' but that President Clinton
would wait before judging whether Milosevic had done enough to
satisfy Western demands.
	   NATO sources in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the NATO ambassadors would probably wait until shortly before
Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met the
conditions.
	   One official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity,
said intelligence reports show ``some indication some units are
regrouping for withdrawal.'' Still, he said, NATO was ready to use
military force once a deadline for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT
Tuesday. The deadline was already been extended once since
Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   But Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, that said if the
Serbs follow through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops,
``that will certainly be a significant advance.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.
	   On Monday, a planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived
with the first shipment of international humanitarian aid,
including medicine and blankets, flown directly to Pristina since
the February fighting erupted.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade before proceeding overland to Kosovo.
Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies. U.S. officials described the aid flight as a
test case for compliance with the aid portion of the Oct. 12
accord.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with terms
of the agreement. Ethnic Albanians, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass refugees.
	   Sporadic violence in the past few weeks, including routine
shelling and shooting by Serb police and some attacks by Albanian
guerrillas, showed the difficulty of ending all hostilities as long
as the heavy deployment of Serb and Yugoslav forces continued.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union has put up legal
walls to protect the data privacy of its 370 million citizen. To
the United States, it looks like a fortress threatening
transatlantic commerce and auguring another trade fight.
	   Despite the looming trouble, the 15 EU nations on Monday backed
the EU executive Commission in continuing talks with Washington on
the issue and hoped a compromise could be found by year-end, EU
officials said.
	   Electronic trade and U.S. companies marketing personal data
faced new obstacles on Monday after a directive came into operation
to improve and extend the protection of private information in the
15 EU nations.
	   It also put into sharp focus the differences how privacy is
protected on both sides of the Atlantic.
	   Personal data information is an increasingly popular commercial
tool in the United States where a ``hands off'' approach offers
limited privacy protection. It is a nascent industry in Europe,
where legal barriers have now been reinforced.
	   ``It's just a totally different ideological viewpoint,'' said an
EU official, who has been involved with the EU-U.S. negotiations on
the issue.
	   ``The U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' a U.S.
diplomat said here and he said that if continued negotiations
proved fruitless and the EU law hurt U.S. business, Washington
would file a complaint at the World Trade Organization.
	   Now, the EU Commission hopes it won't come that far. It ``would
like to see the current discussion with the United States brought
to a successful conclusion by the end of the year,'' the EU
official said.
	   At the heart of the dispute lies the question what will happen
to international banking, credit card business and Internet
commerce if the transatlantic data laws fail to dovetail.
	   The EU member states ``recognized the importance of avoiding the
disruption of data flows,'' the official said.
	   The base principle of the new EU directive is that data should
only be transferred to a non-EU country if it will be adequately
protected there too. It would need a large degree of consent of the
EU citizens concerned.
	   The EU is hoping progress on the issue can be made during next
week's Transatlantic Business Dialogue forum in Charlotte, North
Carolina.
	   ``We expect to continue our dialogue with the EU and we are
optimistic we will reach a mutually acceptable solution,'' the U.S.
diplomat said.
	   European consumers organizations dread the day when a compromise
will be clinched.
	   ``The solution proposed by business and the U.S. administration
would not give European consumers the rights they have under the
(EU) directive, when their data is exported to the United States,''
said Jim Murray, the director of the European consumers group BEUC.
	   The law has already been written into the statute books of
Greece and Portugal, and is also being implemented in Britain,
Sweden and Italy along with additional rules. Now it will gradually
be legalized in the other EU nations too.
	   Personal data including addresses, ages, buying habits, and
income brackets are bought and sold by list brokers in the EU as
well as in the United States. Brokers sell lists on to companies
that are looking for specific demographic groups for their
products.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled
down Kosovo's roads Monday, a day before NATO must decide if
Yugoslavia has met a deadline to reduce troops in the breakaway
province or should face airstrikes.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed Alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
remove more troops from front lines.
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
intelligence reports show ``some indication some units are
regrouping for withdrawal,'' an apparent sign of compliance.
	   Still, he said, NATO remains ready to use military force once
the deadline for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The
deadline was extended once after Milosevic agreed on a peace plan
Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province, part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. About 90
percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic Albanian, and
most favor independence.
	   NATO has demanded that forces in Kosovo be withdrawn or returned
to barracks so that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who fled the fighting can return safely to their homes.
	   In Kosovo, a convoy of more than two dozen Yugoslav tanks,
trucks and other armored vehicles was seen Monday rolling through
the Komorane checkpoint toward Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Serb police removed the road signs ordering vehicles to halt at
the checkpoint 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, but the
policemen manning the small house at the intersection remained on
duty.
	   It was not clear if the checkpoint was being fully dismantled.
	   The government's Serb Media Center said three military units
were returning to their barracks in Urosevac, Pristina and Kosovska
Mitrovica.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President
Bill Clinton was monitoring developments. ``There appears to be a
lot of movement'' of Serb troops, Lockhart said, adding, ``We
haven't seen enough'' pullbacks.
	   ``We're going to wait until the dust settles'' to judge whether
Milosevic is in compliance with NATO demands, he said.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors would probably wait until shortly
before Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic has
met the conditions.
	   But Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, that said if the
Serbs follow through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops,
``that will certainly be a significant advance. But we want to see
the evidence first.''
	   NATO's ``planes are still on the runway,'' ready for airstrikes,
Cook added in Luxembourg. ``If Milosevic does not want them to take
off, then it is up to him to comply. He knows what he has got to
do.''
	   NATO and the United Nations Security Council also has demanded
that Milosevic allow international organizations to deliver
humanitarian aid to refugees without interference.
	   On Monday, a planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived
in Prsitina with the first direct shipment of international
humanitarian aid, including medicine and blankets.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade before proceeding overland to Kosovo.
Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies. U.S. officials described the aid flight as a
test case for compliance with the aid portion of the Oct. 12
accord.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with terms
of the agreement. Ethnic Albanians, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass refugees.
	   On Monday, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
claimed Serb forces shelled four villages in the Klina area, 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital. The center claimed the
same villages were shelled Sunday evening for 90 minutes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Sunday, mourners dived for cover when gunfire whistled
overhead at the funeral of an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian boy
believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began. One observer said their presence would not protect
the mourners from more gunfire.

Moving toward euro, Bank of Italy cuts key interest rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Bank of Italy cut the official discount rate by
a full percentage point Monday, from 5 percent to 4 percent, in a
key move toward getting the country's economy ready for the euro.
	   Among other factors, the national bank cited the ``vast fiscal
reform'' of earlier this year, low inflation, and the week-old
government's commitment to a conservative budget for next year. The
rate cut takes effect Oct. 27.
	   Italy has been paring its budget to prepare for January's debut
of the euro, Europe's common currency.
	   Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi called the cut an
``important step toward interest rate convergence among the euro
countries.''
	   Economists are expecting that rates will converge to the levels
of France or Germany, which are currently around 3.3 percent.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
flew Monday to Saudi Arabia to drum up support for his accord with
Israel and said the deal was the best the Palestinians could get
now.
	   The agreement calls for further Israeli withdrawals from the
West Bank and a Palestinian crackdown on militants to prevent
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``What we got ... is considered the utmost we could get at this
time,'' Arafat told The Associated Press after arriving in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Earlier, Saudi King Fahd said the agreement ``should be the
launching pad for a new phase of just and comprehensive peace for
all the countries of the region.''
	   In Cairo on Sunday, Arafat said he hoped the new
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be ``accurately and
faithfully'' implemented.
	   His comment reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to withdraw from a
further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   In addition to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Arafat has also visited
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to rally support for the accord.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.

Parliament hardliners begin process of holding early elections

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu beating no-confidence motion in graf 2,

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost the
first of several expected political battles over the new peace deal
with the Palestinians on Monday, with legislators deciding to
present an early elections bill to parliament for a vote.
	   But the premier easily beat a no-confidence motion in the
Knesset Monday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, an Israeli security
guard was shot in the neck and his body was dumped in a street in
an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Hebron killing would
endanger the implementation of the new peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over a
12-week period, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government,
parliament's Law Committee voted 9-7 to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days.
The suggested date for the elections was March 16.
	   The bill was supported both by coalition hardliners opposed to
the West Bank withdrawal and by dovish opposition legislators
hoping to bring down the prime minister.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by a special
majority of 60 of the 120 legislators. Supporters of the bill said
they were confident they could pass the legislation.
	   Opposition leader Ehud Barak said he is trying to topple
Netanyahu without hurting the implementation of the peace
agreement.
	   As a result, Barak said his Labor Party will not back a motion
of no confidence in the government submitted by the far-right
opposition party Moledet and to be voted on later Monday.
	   With Labor's help, Netanyahu easily beat the no-confidence
motion with eight votes four, 21 against and 15 abstentions. A
majority of the legislators, including Netanyahu did not show for
the vote.
	   Labor will also back the government when parliament votes on the
peace agreement at the end of a two-day debate starting Nov. 3.
	   ``We will give Mr. Netanyahu an ad hoc safety net for the vote
on the agreement. There is no connection between implementation of
the peace process and early elections,'' Barak told Associated
Press Television News.
	   However, Monday's slaying of an Israeli security guard in Hebron
raised new questions about how much violence the new West Bank deal
can withstand. The killing also put to the test pledges by the
Palestinians to do more to fight Islamic militants who want to
wreck the agreement.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. Moments later, they saw a body lying on
the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car sped away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron. The missing tennis shoe was found
in the car.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim. They said he had been shot three times
in the neck, chest and hand.
	   The victim worked as a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba.

	   According to Iraq's declarations about its chemical weapons, the
20 missile warheads that were being analyzed should have only
contained alcohol, which shouldn't require any decontamination to
destroy, U.N. officials said.
	   The fact that a decontamination product was used suggests that
there might have been something more potent inside the warhead that
needed to be destroyed.
	   Also unclear is why the decontamination products weren't found

	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed all
its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range

lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

announced Aug. 5 that it would no longer cooperate with U.N.
weapons experts.

	   But Netanyahu easily beat a no-confidence motion in the Knesset

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva state authorities Monday requested the
arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is being held
in Britain on another arrest warrant from a Spanish judge.
	   The Swiss Office of Police Affairs said late Monday it had
passed on the request to Britain.
	   The move to set Swiss extradition proceedings in motion follows
a criminal complaint filed last week by the widow of Alexis
Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean double nationality.
	   He disappeared in May 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and it is
suspected that he was kidnapped by the secret police of neighboring
Chile.
	   Geneva authorities ``have come to the conclusion that the legal
conditions are in place to open an inquiry in the case of Augusto
Pinochet Ugarte,'' State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said in a
statement.
	   ``The investigating judge has decided to call for the
provisional arrest of Augusto Pinochet with a view to his
extradition to Switzerland,'' he added.
	   The 82-year-old general has been held at a London clinic since
being arrested earlier this month at the request of a Spanish
magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture
and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared. Jaccard's
was one of the names on the list.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Bertossa and the federal authorities added that the Spanish
effort to extradite Pinochet should be given priority. A Spanish
request for legal assistance from Switzerland, made Friday, has
been passed on to Geneva authorities.
	   No details have been given of the content of the Spanish
request.

Tanjug manager appeals for help over two abducted journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The general manager of Yugoslavia's
state news agency Tanjug appealed Monday to world leaders to help
free s Tanjug journalist and a photographer held by the rebel
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   In a letter to U.S., Russian, Chinese and other leaders, as well
as heads of European Union and Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Tanjug manager Dusan Djordjevic said help
would be ``precious.''
	   Nebojsa Radosevic, 32, and Vladimir Dobricanin, 50, were
captured by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army ten days
ago. The rebels fighting Serb government forces hinted last week
they might release the two journalists but haven't done so.
	   Djordjevic said it was ``unacceptable'' that journalists were
being kidnapped with international monitors present in the
province. He said the move was against a deal recently struck to
establish peace in Kosovo.
	   Another Serb journalist and his driver disappeared last August
and haven't reappeared yet. The KLA are believed to be responsible
for hundreds of kidnappings in Kosovo in the past eight months of
the conflict.

Despite launch mishap, Russia will produce new missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is still planning to build ten Topol-M
intercontinental ballistic missiles _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million
each _ even though one of them malfunctioned and exploded in a test
last week, a news report said Monday.
	   Russia still plans to overhaul much of its existing nuclear
missile arsenal with the single-warhead Topol-M, said Gen. Vladimir
Yakovlev, the head of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Already, construction on installation sites for the missiles is
85 percent complete, Yakovlev said.
	   Yakovlev said another Topol-M test launch would be held soon.
	   Russian officials have said the Topol-M will be the main product
in its drive to modernize the military, mostly because there isn't
enough money to do much else. The country plans to build 35 to 45
Topol-Ms each year starting in 2000.
	   The Topol-M will replace Russia's multiple-warhead RS-18 and
RS-20, two multiple-warhead missile types that are to deactivated
by 2007 under the START-II treaty, which Russia's parliament has
yet to ratify.
	   Last week, a Topol-M blew up minutes after takeoff from the
Plesetsk launchpad in Russia's far northwest, falling harmlessly
nearby, the newspaper Izvestia reported.

EU tightens sanctions against Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The European Union on Monday approved an
extension and a tightening of existing sanctions against the
military junta in Myanmar and joined calls by opposition leader
Aung San Suu Kyi for tourists not to visit the country.
	   EU foreign ministers agreed to widen a visa ban for government
officials so that it applies also to officials who wish only to
transit through the European Union.
	   The ministers also extended current sanctions, which were due to
expire on Thursday. They include the suspension of high-level
government visits, an arms embargo and the suspension of
non-humanitarian aid.
	   The EU last year also ended trade privileges enjoyed by Myanmar
under a system aimed at helping developing nations.
	   The EU has repeatedly condemned the human rights situation in
Myanmar and urged the junta to open talks with the opposition led
by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi.
	   Earlier this month, the 15 EU countries called for the immediate
release of all political prisoners and said Suu Kyi should be
allowed to travel freely around the country.
	   Suu Kyi was under house arrest between 1989 and 1995. She has
been stopped several times in recent months from leaving the
capital Rangoon to meet supporters. Hundreds of opposition members
have been arrested in recent months.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won a
landslide victory in 1990 elections but the military refused to
acknowledge the poll results.

French lab finds nerve agent, but bulk of tests suggest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
decontamination &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs, RAISES question about decontamination product. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A French laboratory found a trace of a
nerve agent on an Iraqi missile warhead, and other lab tests found
traces of a decontamination product that shouldn't be there, U.N.
weapons experts reported Monday.
	   According to Iraq's declarations about its chemical weapons, 20
missile warheads that were being analyzed by French and Swiss
laboratories should have only contained alcohol, which shouldn't
require any decontamination to destroy, U.N. officials said.
	   The fact that a decontamination product was used suggests that
there might have been something more potent inside the warhead that
needed to be destroyed.
	   The European tests were conducted late this summer after a U.S.
laboratory reported finding traces of the deadly nerve agent VX on
fragments of missile warheads in June. The U.S. finding countered
Iraqi claims that it was never able to make enough VX, or stabilize
it properly, to load into missiles.
	   The report didn't say that VX was found in any of the new tests,
saying only that ``The French laboratory reported the presence of a
degradation product of a nerve agent,'' in one sample. The report
noted that French experts said this product could also originate
from other compounds. Sarin or VX are such possible compounds,
diplomats said.
	   However, both the Swiss and the French laboratories found
chemicals known to be degradation products of a decontamination
compound, the report said.
	   U.N. weapons experts noted that there was ``no obvious
explanation,'' as to why the decontamination products were only
found on the second set of tests _ not on the original U.S. tests.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which carries out inspections in
Iraq, suggested in the report that Iraq explain what happened to
the fragments that were analyzed and why degradation products of
nerve agents were found on some.
	   The commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them, before the Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Inspections have been stalled for nearly three months since Iraq
announced Aug. 5 that it would no longer cooperate with U.N.
weapons experts.

Russia's Primakov pledges help to soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has promised
governmental support for beleaguered Russian soccer, saying he is a
great fan of the game.
	   ``Our (team) can play better, and occasionally there are moments
when they do play better, but then they somehow droop,
demagnetize,'' Primakov said in an interview on Russia's ORT
television station.
	   Russian soccer has been hobbled by shortages in federal funding
and a demoralizing loss to Iceland earlier this month in the
qualifying rounds of the European Championships.
	   Primakov said he was a frequent spectator at soccer tournaments
during his college years, and promised that the government would
help Russia's soccer ``to the extent of its powers and abilities.''
	   ``We all must understand that soccer is not just a sport, it's a
game that brings people together,'' Primakov said in the interview
Sunday. ``It's like that everywhere in the world: A win is a
national pride, and a loss is a sorrow for very many.''

Israeli security guard shot and killed in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 3-4 with police saying body of Palestinian man
found near Jewish settlement, anonymous call to Israeli radio &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his body was dumped in downtown Hebron Monday in what
appeared to be an attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking.
	   Several hours later, police found the body of a Palestinian man
near the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank. Israel radio
had received an anonymous phone call from a man speaking in Hebrew
who said a Palestinian had been killed and his body left near
Itamar as an act of revenge for the Hebron murder.
	   ``Responding to the anonymous call ... searches were undertaken
and a body was found in the area. Police and army forces are on
their way to the area,'' said police spokeswoman Linda Menuhim.
There were no other immediate details.
	   The last such killing in Hebron was in August when a member of
the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. After driving for several years, they
saw a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay
sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below
the head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his
sunglasses had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   The victim was a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba.

EU pushes for trade deal with South Africa by end of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it will present
South Africa with a final compromise package in the second half of
November in a last-ditch attempt to clinch a trade deal by the end
of the year.
	   The EU's Commissioner for relations with South Africa Joao de
Deus Pinheiro said he hopes a trade agreement will be ready in time
to be presented to a meeting of EU foreign ministers scheduled Dec.
7.
	   ``We see it as very difficult but we can see a way through,'' a
senior EU official who requested anonymity told reporters.
	   South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and
Pinheiro met Saturday in Johannesburg to try and break a deadlock
in four years of difficult trade talks.
	   The talks bogged down in September, when a deal seemed near. The
European Union demanded South African vintners stop using the names
``sherry'' or ``port'' for any of their wines.
	   South Africa hopes Europe will open its markets to a number of
South African agricultural products, including dairy products, cut
flowers, fresh and canned fruits.
	   Any agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of EU-South Africa
trade, worth a total 17 million European currency units (dlrs 19
million).

Tajik opposition may receive more government seats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmonov said he
might give the opposition another 19 seats in the government, an
opposition leader said Monday.
	   A 1997 peace agreement that ended five years of civil war in
this Central Asian nation calls for 30 percent of federal and local
executive bodies to be filled by opposition members.
	   Opposition members now hold 12 senior government posts and are
entitled to two more, including that of defense minister, news
reports have said.
	   The leader of the main opposition group, Said Abdullo Nuri, told
a session of the National Reconciliation Commission on Monday that
Rakhmonov had tentatively agreed to give 19 more jobs in
governmental agencies to the opposition, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Rakhmonov's hard-line government and the mostly Islamic
opposition in this former Soviet republic have made significant
strides toward reconciliation, but outbreaks of violence still
occur periodically.

 &UR; First direct delivery of aid for Kosovo reaches Yugoslavia
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with plane arriving in Pristina; ADDS quotes,

Pristina, not Montenegro

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a test of Serbia's pledge to
allow unhindered deliveries of humanitarian aid to Kosovo, the
United States on Monday made the first air delivery of medical
supplies and blankets to Pristina since fighting broke out in
February.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, before proceeding overland to
Kosovo. Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies, though aid convoys in Kosovo have operated
with few hindrances in recent weeks.
	   Under an Oct. 12 deal to defuse the Kosovo crisis, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow humanitarian
organizations to work unhindered in Kosovo. Monday's flight is seen
as a test of Milosevic's commitment to that part of the deal.
	   ``The fact that they have allowed us to land here shows that
humanitarian access has greatly improved,'' said Hugh Parmer,
assistant administrator for humanitarian relief at the U.S. Agency
for International Development (AID), who was aboard the flight.
	   The shipment on the Sofia Airline cargo plane, which departed
from Pisa, Italy, on Monday morning, contained 6,000 blankets and
emergency medical supplies _ with everything from band aids to
antibiotics _ to cover the needs of 10,000 people for a three-month
period.
	   A U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman estimated Monday
that 10,000 of the more than 200,000 Kosovo refugees were living in
the woods.
	   Humanitarian officials say the refugees now have enough food to
survive the winter, but what they need most is blankets and plastic
sheeting for tents, which is expected to arrive next week.
	   Parmer said the humanitarian portion of the accord had
apparently been met.
	   ``But the only true humanitarian solution is sufficient security
for people to return home,'' Parmer said ``And that does not appear
to exist yet.''
	   Milosevic has until 1900 GMT Tuesday to comply with other
pledges made under the accord, including the withdrawal of some
troops and special police forces from Kosovo.
	   The flight made a stopover in the small republic of Montenegro,
where it off-loaded dlrs 117,000 worth of blankets and medicine.
	   Serbia and Montenegro together form Yugoslavia. More than 40,000
Kosovo Albanian refugees have fled to Montenegro since fighting
between Albanian separatists and Serb security forces escalated
eight months ago.
	   ``The United States understands the sacrifices that the people
of Montenegro have made to accommodate the needs of their neighbors
who have been driven out by violence,'' Parmer said in Podgorica,
Montenegro's capital.
	   Montenegro Vice President Dragisa Burzan, who greeted Parmer at
the airport, said his country was desperately trying to build
shelters for the refugees, most of whom are living with local
families.
	   Parmer had originally planned to visit camps Tuesday to assess
any ``special needs'' of displaced people, but later postponed the
tour to Wednesday due to the NATO deadline.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got
past the first of several political hurdles Monday aimed at
challenging a new Mideast peace deal by winning a no-confidence
motion in parliament.
	   But the threat of early elections loomed after legislators
decided to present a bill to parliament calling for a spring vote.
	   Selling the new land-for-peace deal to hard-liners in his
coalition government has not been easy. A brutal killing of a
Jewish settler, apparently by Palestinians, in the West Bank city
of Hebron Monday was likely to make the process even harder.
	   Still, lawmakers from the dovish Labor party and its left-wing
partners made good on a promise to back the premier in parliament,
at least until the new accord signed Friday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, is implemented.
	   ``We believe the prime minister should be removed from office
and we believe in early elections ... but we will not trade our
principles for political gain. For the sake of peace, we will not
allow (Netanyahu) to fall,'' said Labor lawmaker Eli Goldshmidt,
explaining to parliament why his party did not vote against the
premier Monday.
	   The no-confidence motion brought by the tiny extreme right-wing
Moledet party failed to pass with eight votes for, 21 against and
15 abstentions. A majority of the 120 lawmakers, including
Netanyahu, did not even show up for the vote, which had almost no
chance of passing.
	   Labor's Knesset support is key to Netanyahu who faces growing
opposition to the peace plan from within his own coalition
government. But hardliners opposed to the West Bank withdrawal and
opposition legislators hoping to bring down Netanyahu agreed Monday
to join forces for early national elections.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government, the
Knesset Law Committee voted to hold a first reading on a bill to
disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days,
suggesting the date for the elections was March 16, after the
current peace accord is to be implemented.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by 60 of the 120
legislators. Supporters of the bill said they were confident they
could pass the legislation.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli police said they found the body of a
Palestinian man outside of the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the
West Bank. Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the body was
discovered after an anonymous caller speaking in Hebrew said that a
Palestinian had been killed in revenge for the Hebron murder
earlier in the day.

Far-right leader hails Pinochet's fight against communism

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on Monday
criticized the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, saying the former
Chilean dictator probably saved South America _ and the world _
from communism.
	   ``Pinochet prevented Communists from coming to power in his
country. By doing that he perhaps saved South America and maybe
even the whole world'' from communism, Le Pen told reporters.
	   Pinochet seized power in Chile in a violent 1973 coup, ousting
President Salvador Allende, a democratically-elected leftist.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 at a London clinic
where he had undergone back surgery. A Spanish magistrate is
seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and
terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended in 1990.
	   Le Pen, the leader of France's anti-immigrant National Front, is
frequently accused of racism and anti-Semitism. He has been
convicted in France for referring to the Nazi gas chambers as a
``detail in history.'' He faces trial in Germany for similar
remarks.
	   Le Pen criticized what he said was an increasing ``worldwide
judicial witchhunt'' against figures such as Pinochet.
	   On Monday, Swiss authorities also requested Pinochet's arrest
following a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva by the
widow of a student who disappeared in May 1977.
	   It is suspected that he was kidnapped by the Chilean secret
police in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
	   Also Monday, a similar complaint was filed in a Paris court by a
French woman on behalf of Anne-Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne
Pesle, disappeared while working in Chile in September 1973.
	   The Franco-Chilean Coordination against Impunity, a group
representing Chileans in France and human rights activists, said
the Pesle family wanted Pinochet extradited to France to face
charges of crimes against humanity.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Twenty-five suspects facing trial before
the U.N. court on the Rwanda genocide announced a hunger strike
Monday to protest what they called the panel's bias and its refusal
to pay for suspects' choices of defense attorneys.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of tribunal-appointed defense
attorneys free-of-charge, and has said suspects may select
non-tribunal attorneys but that the court will not pay for them.
	   The 25 suspects said they were joining the hunger strike of a
convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating last
week because the U.N. tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as defense attorney.
	   Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, defended its selection of
lawyers, saying it was the fairest way to prevent attorneys from
some countries from dominating defense panels. The tribunal puts
together six-member panels from a pool of 41 lawyers from 13
countries. defendants choose their attorneys from those panels.
	   Okali said the 25 detainees are panicking because they realize
the tribunal's work is moving forward.
	   ``The reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account
persons accused of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali
said. ``In these circumstances, these detainees feel they have
nothing to lose by engaging in these agitations.''
	   Akayesu is, graf 4 pvs

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Urging the High Court to order Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's immediate release, his lawyers said Monday that
extraditing the former Chilean dictator to Spain to face charges of
murder, torture and kidnapping would be like sending Queen
Elizabeth II to be tried in Argentina for soldiers' deaths in the
1982 Falkland Islands war.
	   However, a Spanish magistrate has issued a new extradition
warrant to cover an unspecified number of murders, tortures and
kidnappings up to 1992, two years after Pinochet's 17-year rule
ended, the court heard.
	   Lawyers opposing his release gave no detailed explanation for
the new warrant, but said evidence was building up all the time
against Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed in a London
hospital on a Spanish warrant citing 94 victims, including
Spaniards, and lawyers said later it could be broadened to include
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared after he seized
power.
	   Also Monday, Geneva state authorities added to legal pressure to
keep Pinochet in Europe by setting in motion an application for
extradition over the 1977 disappearance of Alexis Jaccard, a
student with dual Swiss-Chilean citizenship.
	   With Pinochet, who underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9, still in the
expensive London Clinic under police guard, Chile's deputy foreign
minister appealed to Britain to release him on humanitarian
grounds.
	   ``He is ill, (and) in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano
Fernandez told reporters in London.
	   In the High Court, dozens of Chilean exiles watched Pinochet's
lawyers argue that ex-heads of state have immunity from prosecution
for acts committed in an ``official capacity.''
	   Alun Jones, representing British and Spanish prosecutors and the
British police, countered that ``the official functions of the
president of Chile do not include the systematic torture and
elimination of political opponents.''
	   Nicholls said that to deny Pinochet immunity opened the prospect
of the queen on a visit to the United States being extradited to
Argentina over deaths of Argentine soldiers in the war with Britain
over the Falkland Islands which claimed some 1,000 lives.
	   ``That (granting Pinochet immunity) does not raise the specter
of a future Hitler going unpunished,'' said Nicholls, maintaining
that international tribunals can still apply to try such people.
	   Nicholls said extradition warrant was also invalid because
Pinochet is not Spanish.
	   The hearing was expected to last through part of Tuesday. Lord
Chief Justice Thomas Bingham indicated that when the hearing was
completed, the court would reserve judgment until a later date. He
did not say when.

Fugitive German `Bonnie and Clyde' couple arrested in Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A German `Bonnie and Clyde' couple
wanted in at home in connection with murders and armed robberies
were arrested in Portugal, police said Monday.
	   Norman Volker Franz, 28, and his 21-year-old wife Sandra were
arrested Saturday at a supermarket parking lot in Albufeira, some
300 kilometers (190 miles) south of Lisbon, a police spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The couple, described by police as highly dangerous, had been on
the run in Europe for several months and had recently moved to
Albufeira where they dealt in real estate. They were unarmed and
did not resist arrest, the spokesman said.
	   German police had issued an international arrest warrant and
extradition request for the couple in connection with three murders
and two armed robberies allegedly committed in Germany, according
to police.
	   The two are suspected of killing three money transport employees
in July 1997, two in Halle and one in Weimar. They allegedly got
away with 500,000 marks (dlrs 300,000) in the robberies.
	   In Germany, the two have been compared to the legendary criminal
couple Bonnie and Clyde who carried out a string of robberies and
killings in the United States in the 1930s.
	   Besides allegedly killing the transport employees, Volker Franz
was convicted in 1996 of killing two of his own gang and carrying
out some 90 robberies. He escaped from prison a year later and has
been on the run since.
	   German prosecutors in Dortmund, Halle, and Erfurt have said they
will seek the couple's extradition.

Russian cannot service foreign debt in 1999, government says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Even if Russia figures out how to pay off this
year's debts, it won't be able to pay its foreign debts in 1999
unless it receives international aid, a top official said Monday.
	   Russia's government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt
in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it off, said Alexander
Zhukov, head of parliament's budget committee.
	   The announcement is more bad news for Russia, which is trying to
restructure this year's debt, frozen in August. Talks in London
with foreign banks broke down last week, but Zhukov insisted Russia
would find a way to pay off this year's debts.
	   That may prove difficult. Zhukov said tax receipts and other
revenues for the first nine months of the year were 51 percent of
targeted totals. He did not provide exact figures.
	   The Interfax news agency had a higher estimate, saying revenues
from January through September totaled 191.3 billion rubles (dlrs
11.2 billion), or 86.7 percent of the amount the government planned
for that period.
	   The devaluation of the ruble in August and the ensuing jump in
inflation left Russians with little money for anything but the bare
essentials _ and taxes are usually not among them.
	   State coffers will also be too empty to fulfill dlrs 8 billion
in already signed forward contracts, under which the government
promises to sell dollars to foreign investors at a fixed exchange
rate at a future date, Zhukov said.
	   The lack of a plan to boost revenues and slash spending, six
weeks after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov took office, has
worried international lenders.
	   After an eight-hour meeting Monday, senior Cabinet members
finally approved an emergency economic plan, authored by Communist
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. The government released no
details of the plan.
	   The plan is likely to favor industrial giants left over from
Soviet times that are ``capable of increasing (their) contribution
to revenues which the country needs so badly,'' Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants said Monday, according to Interfax.
	   The International Monetary fund and other lenders want to see a
sound economic plan is being implemented before releasing more of a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated during the summer.
	   Shapovalyants said the IMF would be the first to read the new
plan.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank reported Monday that Russia's money
supply rose by one percent in a week, a sign that it is printing
more money. Russia's Central Bank has said it plans to print
another 20 billion rubles this year to help cover the budget
deficit, which has sparked fears of inflation.

	   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) _ The Honduran government ordered
evacuations along the coast and sent air force planes to retrieve
people from remote Caribbean islands on Monday as the season's most
powerful hurricane swirled toward Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said. The storm was expected to remain in the northwest
Caribbean for the next three days, said Jack Beven of the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   The storm became a Category 5 hurricane Monday, with winds of
170 mph (273 kph). At 1800 GMT, Mitch's center was 55 miles (90
kilometers) east-southeast of Honduras' Swan Island and was moving
west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph)
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of
alert. He told residents of coastal areas to leave their homes for
more secure ground inland, but didn't tell them where to stay.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
north of the capital and 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the coast.
	   San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they might set up
shelters in public schools.
	   The president ordered air force planes to evacuate people from
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the coast of
central Honduras.
	   Fishermen tied up their boats and people bought up food, water
and batteries, Red Cross officials said. Some residents headed to
higher ground.
	   Before moving toward Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital of Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in
the Cayman Islands.
	   At a Kingston prison, guards used tear gas to quell a brief
protest by inmates upset because the storm forced authorities to
close the jail, preventing relatives from bringing food.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast Sunday night,
and the full force of the hurricane was expected to sweep along the
coast today and Tuesday.
	   Flores ordered public offices closed on the Atlantic coast of
Honduras as of noon today, and canceled classes at public and
private schools. Health officials sent medicine to public hospitals
along the coast.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs in the northern
zone,'' said Vice President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be
benevolent with Hondurans.''
	   In 1974, Hurricane Fifi swept Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing
at least 2,000 people and destroying 70 percent of the country's
infrastructure.

Prime Minister asks defense forces to be vigilant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ In a meeting with senior military
commanders Monday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee cautioned
the defense forces to remain vigilant despite official talks with
rival Pakistan over the Kashmir dispute, domestic news agencies
reported.
	   ``While we are approaching these talks in good faith and
constructive spirit, we will not compromise on our security
interests,'' Vajpayee said, according to the United News of India.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir, a territory divided between the two countries but which
both claim as a whole.
	   Since India and Pakistan conducted a series of underground
nuclear tests in May, they have been under international pressure
to amicably resolve their disputes, mainly over Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have been trying to resolve their dispute
through dialogue without much success. They are scheduled to resume
talks in February.
	   During his talks with military leaders Monday, Vajpayee
reiterated his position that India would nor be pressured into
signing any arbitrary and discriminatory treaty, a clear reference
to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that disallows signatories
from conducting nuclear tests.
	   India has resisted signing the treaty so far on grounds that it
gives established nuclear powers an unfair advantage over other
countries who have not have the benefit of years of testing.
	   ``We must move forward for India's rightful place in the global
arena,'' Vajpayee said.

Supreme Court rejects rehabilitation of members ofpro-Nazi
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Supreme Court of Justice rejected
Monday the rehabilitation of eight officials in Romania's pro-Nazi
wartime government. In doing so, the court upheld their
Communist-era convictions.
	   Only one of nine former pro-Nazi officials was rehabilitated,
Romanian state radio reported.
	   The nine men served in 1940-44 under Gen. Ion Antonescu, the
military who sided with Hitler during World War II.
	   Their relatives appealed a sentence meted out by the then
Romanian Stalinist authorities in 1949, which sent the nine up to
10 years in prison for ``crime against peace.''
	   With one exception, all died while serving their prison term.
The ninth died soon after his release.
	   One year ago, general prosecutor Sorin Moisescu annulled the
convictions, triggering sharp criticism from the Unites States,
which said the nine had been involved in the persecution of
Romanian Jews.
	   About half of the 850,000 Jews living in Romania before World
War II were killed by the Nazis. Most of the survivors left after
the communists came to power after 1945.
	   U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Congressman Christopher Smith
wrote to Romania's president, protesting the pending
rehabilitations.
	   The prosecutor reversed his own decision soon afterward.
	   The Supreme Court of Justice now upheld the convictions and
annulled only that of Toma Petre Ghitulescu, who resigned as deputy
state secretary in the Economics Ministry before Romania joined
Germany in the campaign against Russia in 1941.

Future German foreign minister to mix continuity with new action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new quote in 8th graf, ADDS background on French concerns
over stronger German-British ties in 9-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's new leftist government will seek
continuity in foreign policy but also put more stress on human
rights and economic development, the Greens foreign minister-to-be
said in an interview published Monday.
	   ``There is no green foreign policy, but a German foreign
policy,'' Greens leader Joschka Fischer told the leftist daily
Liberation.
	   Europe's most economically powerful and populous nation will
continue to support European unification, the euro single currency,
European Union expansion eastward and EU reform, he said.
	   ``But we will add new accents: the human rights question,
durable development, the democratization of Europe, the relaunch of
disarmament,'' the 50-year-old leader said.
	   ``I also hope that with our partners we can definitively put an
end to wars in ex-Yugoslavia,'' Fischer said.
	   Following the footsteps of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder,
Fischer was to make his first foreign trip Wednesday to France, a
day after he and the rest of the new government were to take
office.
	   The trip underlines the ultimate importance of the Franco-German
axis in building the 15-nation EU. ``I hope it will be
revitalized,'' he said of the axis.
	   ``Franco-German relations are vital for European integration,''
Fischer said. ``I hope that new glorious chapters will be added to
those already written.''
	   France has voiced fears about Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's desire to forge closer ties with Britain, saying the
Franco-German axis might be neglected as a result.
	   But Schroeder, due to be sworn in on Tuesday, said during a
recent visit to Paris that there was no cause for concern, pledging
that the two countries would remain the strongest of allies.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In convoys of rumbling tanks and
trucks, Yugoslav troops and Serb police vacated some heavily
fortified positions in Kosovo on Monday, the eve of a NATO deadline
to comply with a peace agreement or face punishing airstrikes.
	   The withdrawal was President Slobodan Milosevic's 11th-hour
attempt to convince NATO he was fulfilling the agreement he reached
two weeks ago with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the
eight-month Kosovo conflict.
	   Throughout the day, lines of green army tanks, artillery trucks
and blue police in armored vehicles were seen moving toward
military and police barracks in Pristina, the provincial capital,
and other cities.
	   In the Drenica region, 18 miles (30 kilometers) west of
Pristina, a steady drizzle filled freshly gouged tracks made by
tanks withdrawing from roadside positions they assumed Oct. 18.
	   Several police checkpoints were vacant, including one in
Malisevo _ the last front line in fighting that virtually halted
last month. All that remained was a tattered Yugoslav flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   The guerrilla, who refused to give his name, said he and other
separatist fighters were checking to see if it was safe for
civilians to come back because there was a minefield in the area.
	   Police remained at a few checkpoints in the area as dusk
settled, and there was no indication that anyone had returned to
the heavily damaged villages nearby.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who fled during the Serb offensive that began
Feb. 28, say they'll only come home once all police and soldiers
have left. The return of an estimated 300,000 refugees, including
up to 10,000 believed living in the woods, is a key provision of
the Holbrook-Milosevic plan.
	   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, briefed alliance
ambassadors Monday in Brussels, Belgium, on his weekend talks in
Belgrade, where he told Milosevic to remove more troops from front
lines.
	   Hundreds of people have died since Milosevic launched his
crackdown on the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting
for independence for the province from Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanian, and most favor independence.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there
appeared to be ``a lot of movement,'' but that U.S. President Bill
Clinton would wait before judging whether Milosevic had done enough
to satisfy Western demands.
	   NATO sources in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the NATO ambassadors would probably wait until shortly before
Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met the
conditions.
	   One official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity,
said intelligence reports show ``some indication some units are
regrouping for withdrawal.'' Still, he said, NATO was ready to use
military force, if necessary, once a deadline for compliance runs
out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The deadline has already been extended
once since Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   But Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said that if the
Serbs follow through with pledges to withdraw weaponry and troops,
``that will certainly be a significant advance.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.
	   Meanwhile, a planeload of American medicine and blankets arrived
Monday with the first shipment of international humanitarian aid to
be flown directly to Pristina since the February fighting erupted.
	   Up to now, all international aid deliveries had to pass through
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, before proceeding overland to
Kosovo. Serb security forces have hindered several aid convoys from
delivering supplies. U.S. officials described the aid flight as a
test case for compliance with the aid portion of the Oct. 12
accord.
	   The government has repeatedly claimed it is complying with terms
of the agreement. Ethnic Albanians, however, claim that Serb-led
forces withdraw when diplomatic monitors appear and then return
after they leave to harass refugees.
	   Sporadic violence in the past few weeks, including routine
shelling and shooting by Serb police and some attacks by Albanian
guerrillas, showed the difficulty of ending all hostilities as long
as the heavy deployment of Serb and Yugoslav forces continued.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his body was dumped in downtown Hebron Monday in what
appeared to be an attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking.
	   Several hours later, police found the body of a Palestinian man
near the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank. Police had
received an anonymous phone call from a man speaking in Hebrew who
said a Palestinian had been killed and his body left near Itamar as
an act of revenge for the Hebron murder.
	   ``Responding to the anonymous call ... searches were undertaken
and a body was found in the area. Police and army forces are on
their way to the area,'' said police spokeswoman Linda Menuhim.
There were no other immediate details.
	   Israel TV identifed the Palestinian man as Mohammed Zalmouk, a
65-year-old from a neighboring Palestinian village who worked in
the olive groves outside the settlement.
	   The last such killing in Hebron was in August when a member of
the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. After driving for several yards, they
saw a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim identified as 29 year-old Daniel Vargas, dressed in
white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay sprawled face down on the
pavement. A puddle of blood spread below the head. The man wore a
wedding band and the black strap of his sunglasses had Hebrew
writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   Vargas was a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
could face a tough battle getting his economic austerity program
through congress, if the mixed message from voters in weekend
gubernatorial elections is any indication.
	   The president's package of spending cuts, tax increases and
other measures aimed at pulling Brazil out of economic turmoil are
expected to be introduced this week.
	   Cardoso's cause was given a boost with the reelection of one of
his key allies as governor of Brazil's largest state in Sunday's
elections, seen by many Brazilians as a referendum on Cardoso's
austerity measures.
	   But opposition candidates took five of the other 12
governorships, and even governors who support Cardoso may be loathe
to back measures that will cause hardship for their states.
	   ``Concerned with their political future, governors may hesitate
to throw their support behind what are certainly going to be
unpopular measures,'' said Claudio Goncalves Couto, a political
scientist at Sao Paulo's Roman Catholic University. ``Considering
the sway they have over their congressional blocs, one can safely
say Cardoso will face a wall of resistance.''
	   Brazil is caught up in the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before spreading here. In
the past two months, investors fearful of an economic slump and
weaker currency have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from the
country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund are
discussing ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65
billion, equal to 7 percent of its gross domestic product. The
austerity plan must be tough enough to persuade the IMF to approve
emergency loans worth dlrs 30 billion.
	   Couto said a lot of horse trading will be needed to get the
measures approved ``and this could weaken the package, which, in
turn, could dilute the IMF bailout package.''
	   Couto said Cardoso's hand was strengthened with the reelection
of ally Mario Covas as governor of Sao Paulo state, Brazil's
wealthiest and most populous. The industrial and financial
powerhouse has a population of more than 34 million, accounts for
more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and holds 70 seats
in the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies.
	   Covas secured his second term by turning back the challenge of
former governor Paulo Maluf, who won 45 percent of the vote to
Covas's 55 percent.
	   Covas told reporters his victory showed that voters understand
``that you cannot spend more than you take in.''
	   Covas is a favorite of the government's economic team for his
work in cleaning up state accounts and privatizing state energy
sector assets during his first term.
	   ``By electing Covas, the electorate voted in favor of
austerity,'' Health Minister Jose Serra said.
	   But three of the states that elected opposition governors _ Rio
de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul _ wield considerable
political and economic clout. With a combined population of nearly
40 million, the three states account for nearly a third of the
economy and 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   ``These governors will likely use their influence to reduce, as
much as possible, the impact the austerity measures will have on
their states,'' Couto said.
	   But, while Couto predicted a tough going for the president,
political analyst Alberto Almeida of Rio's Fluminense Federal
University noted that none of the successful opposition candidates
was a hard-line foe of Cardoso.
	   ``The opposition is very moderate,'' he said. ``They want to
please their constituents at home, and ... any frontal opposition
would just create problems.''
	   Sao Paulo political analyst Marcos Figueiredo said the election
results ``could have been much worse.''
	   ``The outcome was generally good for Cardoso,'' he said. ``Even
though he lost some states, his support base hasn't changed too
much and Sao Paulo was an extraordinary success.''

New parliament sets Germany on path to ``Berlin Republic''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Newly elected lawmakers convened Monday for
the first time, opening an era of change that returns the left to
power after 16 years with promises to put Germans back to work and
to butress the social welfare state.
	   But one of the biggest changes under will be a move already in
motion: the government's return to the prewar capital Berlin next
year. Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, to be sworn in Tuesday,
will lead a new generation of lawmakers who have little direct
memory of World War II and therefore feel less burdened by Berlin's
historical links to Nazi Germany and the Prussian military state.
	   In his inaugural speech as president of the new parliament,
Wolfgang Thierse said the ``Berlin Republic'' represents a more
modern Germany.
	   ``I view Berlin as an opportunity,'' Thierse, a Berlin lawmaker
for the Social Democrats. ``I don't believe that these fears are
justified.''
	   A reminder of the nation's past came from parliament's oldest
member, Fred Gebhardt, elected for the former East German
communists. He pleaded with his colleagues to resist ``national
megalomania'' and to fight racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Gebhardt's grandfather, a Social Democratic lawmaker during the
1920s, was shot by the Nazis at the end of World War II.
	   In contrast, Thierse embodies united Germany, reaching the
highest post for a politician from former communist East Germany
with his election Monday to chair parliament.
	   A 55-year-old Social Democrat, he was active in the democracy
movement that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989 and paved the
way for unification the following year.
	   He reminded Schroeder of one of his biggest challenges: making
easterners feel fully accepted in Germany and bringing the region's
struggling economy up to western standards.
	   ``This inner-German discourse isn't about to end for a long
time,'' he said. ``West Germans also must accept united Germany and
its changes.''
	   Another ``measure of how modern, how European our Germany is''
will be the new government's success in promoting integration of
foreigners, Thierse said.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats, who won the Sept. 27 election,
have set an alliance with the environmentalist Greens that gives
them a comfortable 21-seat majority in the new parliament.
	   Key pledges include phasing out nuclear power, tax relief for
people with average incomes and allowing more foreigners to become
German citizens.
	   ``We have a long road before us,'' Schroeder said Monday.
	   Joining him is a rejuvenated parliament: About a quarter of the
669 lawmakers are new and a record number _ 207 _ are women.
Carsten Schneider, a 22-year-old Social Democrat, is parliament's
youngest member ever.
	   Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl closed a chapter in German
history Monday as President Roman Herzog formally ended his tenure.
Earlier, the man who united Germany received a special order of
merit honoring his service to the country and to Europe.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot in
the neck and his body was dumped in downtown Hebron Monday in what
appeared to be an attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediately claim of responsibility for the
killing. However, several Israelis have been killed in tense Hebron
in the past by militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking.
	   Several hours later, police found the body of a Palestinian man
near the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank. Police had
received an anonymous phone call from a man speaking in Hebrew who
said a Palestinian had been killed and his body left near Itamar as
an act of revenge for the Hebron murder.
	   ``Responding to the anonymous call ... searches were undertaken
and a body was found in the area. Police and army forces are on
their way to the area,'' said police spokeswoman Linda Menuhim.
There were no other immediate details.
	   Israel TV identifed the Palestinian man as Mohammed Zalmouk, a
65-year-old from a neighboring Palestinian village who worked in
the olive groves outside the settlement.
	   The last such killing in Hebron was in August when a member of
the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of a new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Monday's incident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon gmt) in
the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in an area that is
under Israeli control and located about 400 meters (yards) from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
	   Several Palestinian journalists were driving along Wadi Abu
Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood when they saw a car coming
toward them at high speed. After driving for several yards, they
saw a body lying on the pavement, the journalists said.
	   The victim identified as 29 year-old Daniel Vargas, dressed in
white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay sprawled face down on the
pavement. A puddle of blood spread below the head. The man wore a
wedding band and the black strap of his sunglasses had Hebrew
writing. He wore only one tennis shoe.
	   The car drove away, and was later found abandoned in the
Palestinian-run area of Hebron.
	   The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who
tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said
he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand.
	   Vargas was a security guard at a power station in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat
Arba.

U.S, EU optimistic that gap with EU on data privacy can be bridged

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union has put up legal
walls to protect the data privacy of its 370 million citizen. To
the United States, it looks like a fortress threatening
trans-Atlantic commerce and auguring another trade fight.
	   Despite the looming trouble, the 15 EU nations on Monday backed
the EU executive Commission in continuing talks with Washington on
the issue and hoped a compromise could be found by year-end, EU
officials said.
	   Electronic trade and U.S. companies marketing personal data
faced new obstacles on Monday after a directive came into operation
to improve and extend the protection of private information in the
15 EU nations.
	   It also put into sharp focus the differences how privacy is
protected on both sides of the Atlantic.
	   Personal data information is an increasingly popular commercial
tool in the United States where a ``hands off'' approach offers
limited privacy protection. It is a nascent industry in Europe,
where legal barriers have now been reinforced.
	   ``It's just a totally different ideological viewpoint,'' said an
EU official, who has been involved with the EU-U.S. negotiations on
the issue.
	   ``The U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' a U.S.
diplomat said here and he said that if continued negotiations
proved fruitless and the EU law hurt U.S. business, Washington
would file a complaint at the World Trade Organization.
	   Now, the EU Commission hopes it won't come that far. It ``would
like to see the current discussion with the United States brought
to a successful conclusion by the end of the year,'' the EU
official said.
	   At the heart of the dispute lies the question what will happen
to international banking, credit card business and Internet
commerce if the trans-Atlantic data laws fail to dovetail.
	   The EU member states ``recognized the importance of avoiding the
disruption of data flows,'' the official said.
	   The base principle of the new EU directive is that data should
only be transferred to a non-EU country if it will be adequately
protected there too. It would need a large degree of consent of the
EU citizens concerned.
	   The EU is hoping progress on the issue can be made during next
week's Transatlantic Business Dialogue forum in Charlotte, North
Carolina.
	   ``We expect to continue our dialogue with the EU and we are
optimistic we will reach a mutually acceptable solution,'' the U.S.
diplomat said.
	   European consumers organizations dread the day when a compromise
will be clinched.
	   ``The solution proposed by business and the U.S. administration
would not give European consumers the rights they have under the
(EU) directive, when their data is exported to the United States,''
said Jim Murray, the director of the European consumers group BEUC.
	   The law has already been written into the statute books of
Greece and Portugal, and is also being implemented in Britain,
Sweden and Italy along with additional rules. Now it will gradually
be legalized in the other EU nations too.
	   Personal data including addresses, ages, buying habits, and
income brackets are bought and sold by list brokers in the EU as
well as in the United States. Brokers sell lists on to companies
that are looking for specific demographic groups for their
products.

Colombian president's challenge: Sell Washington on peace plan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's former president couldn't get
a U.S. visa.
	   But unlike his scandal-crippled predecessor, President Andres
Pastrana should get a warm welcome Tuesday when he arrives in
Washington for the first state visit by a Colombian president in
more than two decades.
	   U.S. relations with this violent, drug-producing nation improved
radically after his election in June.
	   The normalized, broadened relationship could be damaged,
however, by Pastrana's insistence on de-emphasizing drug crop
eradication.
	   He is trying to end a 34-year civil conflict with leftist
guerrillas whose insurgency is bankrolled in large part by taxing
drug production in vast areas of Colombia's countryside.
	   After he arrives in Washington, Pastrana will have a lot of
explaining to do.
	   ``My government will not allow peace to be hijacked by
narcotics,'' the 44-year-old Pastrana said in a speech last week.
``Prolonging the conflict in Colombia benefits first and foremost
the drug bosses.''
	   President Clinton and other Washington heavyweights will likely
want Pastrana to explain exactly what he is prepared to concede to
rebels in upcoming peace talks, something the Colombian president
so far has not done publicly.
	   ``The challenge for Pastrana is to ... communicate clearly what
the Colombian proposal is and to show he's thought it out and that
the terms are clear and precise, even if that includes terms that
may not be what the U.S. government likes,'' said Michael Shifter,
senior fellow at the Washington think tank Inter-American Dialogue.
	   The United States isolated Colombia's previous president,
Ernesto Samper, from the moment it learned his 1994 campaign
accepted dlrs 6 million from drug traffickers. Two years later, the
United States revoked his visa.
	   Samper has denied he solicited the cartel donations.
	   He placated U.S. demands for decisive anti-narcotics measures by
producing record aerial eradication of drug crops. He also
shepherded through Congress laws that stiffened jail terms for drug
lords, made it easier to seize their ill-gotten assets and restored
extradition of Colombian nationals.
	   Free of his predecessor's handicaps, Pastrana has made it clear
that Washington's long-held policy priority in Colombia, the drug
war, is secondary for him.
	   Without peace, he argues, there can be no effective local
government, justice and development in areas of guerrilla
influence.
	   Pastrana says drug crop eradication has been a failure and an
environmental menace in this nation that exports more than 80
percent of the world's cocaine and a growing amount of heroin.
	   Despite intense fumigation by crop-dusters protected from rebel
ground-fire by helicopter gunships, Colombia's coca crop, the basis
of cocaine, has doubled to 79,500 hectares (310 square miles) since
1993.
	   While not abandoning eradication, Pastrana is pushing for
alternative development to wean peasants off drug crops. He says
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the
hemisphere's oldest and largest rebel band, has offered to
cooperate.
	   That approach is being received skeptically by Republicans with
a majority in the U.S. Congress, which last week passed legislation
that will give Colombian police an additional dlrs 200 million in
anti-narcotics aid.
	   The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act includes a clause
that suspends all anti-drug aid if Pastrana ``negotiates or permits
the establishment of a demilitarized zone'' free of eradication.
	   The language is a reaction to Pastrana's agreement to withdraw
government troops before Nov. 7 from a rebel-dominated swath of
southern Colombia the size of Switzerland. FARC requested the troop
withdrawal from the area, which contains about 30 percent of the
country's coca crop.
	   However, the act has an escape clause: Clinton can waive the
sanction for 90 days, the withdrawal's announced duration.
	   Though there has never been any aerial eradication in the
pullout zone, if Pastrana wants to extend the withdrawal, he'll
have some more explaining to do.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three runaway train cars loaded with concrete
collided with a bus Monday in the Russian Far East, killing 22
people and injuring 26, news reports said.
	   The bus was torn apart when the rail cars carrying concrete
panels and other construction materials rammed into it at an
unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   It was unclear how the cars detached from their train.
	   Twenty-two people were killed, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Austrian aircraft designers have
agreed to jointly produce MiG warplanes at a Vienna plant, with
Russia supplying the parts and the Austrians coming up with the
cash, a news report said Monday.
	   The plans for the MiG-110 are expected to be discussed during
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's visit to Vienna on Tuesday, the

	   Russia's main MiG production center has already received 20

plane's parts, Lev Shengelaya, the plane's chief designer, was
quoted as saying.
	   He would not name the plant or say how much the project would
cost.
	   The MiG-110 would be able to airlift cargoes, paratroopers or
emergency rescue teams, Shengelaya said.

Man holds 3-year-old boy hostage with knife on Berlin subway

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Police freed a 3-year-old child from a kidnapper
who had grabbed the boy from his mother in a Berlin subway station
on Monday and held a knife to his chest, demanding a plane ticket.
	   The boy had minor scratches from the kidnapping, which lasted
five hours, police said.
	   The 25 to 30-year-old Arabic-speaking man apparently wanted to
go to Algeria, although police described his demands as vague.
	   He demanded a plane ticket, then money, which he threw away
after it was given to him. At one point he also demanded an
imprisoned member of the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front be freed,
police said.
	   A representative from the Algerian consulate and an imam from a
Berlin mosque, where the 25 to 30-year-old man had been thrown out
earlier in the day for ``uncivil behavior,'' helped with the
negotiations, police said.
	   The kidnapper was overpowered when he became distracted and
stopped pressing the knife against the boy, police said.
	   The child had been seized at about noon at the Kottbusser Tor
station in the Kreuzberg district. All streets and subway exits in
the area were closed off as police negotiated with the kidnapper.
	   A witness said the mother fell to her knees pleading with the
man to give her child back, but was ignored. During the ordeal she
was cared for by police psychologists along with her husband, who
had arrived at the scene later.

Netanyahu beats no-confidence motion but may face early elections

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got
past the first of several political hurdles Monday aimed at
challenging a new Mideast peace deal by winning a no-confidence
motion in parliament.
	   But the threat of early elections loomed after legislators
decided to present a bill to parliament calling for a spring vote.
	   Selling the new land-for-peace deal to hard-liners in his
coalition government has not been easy. A brutal killing of a
Jewish settler, apparently by Palestinians, in the West Bank city
of Hebron Monday was likely to make the process even harder.
	   In a demonstration outside the premier's home later Monday,
hundreds of right-wing Israelis carried torches and angry signs
calling for Netanyahu's resignation. Many chanted `` Bibi go
home,'' and ``Bibi is a traitor,'' referring to the prime minister
by his nickname. Some protesters scuffled with police and tried to
break through a barrier. Police said 21 protesters were arrested.
	   Still, lawmakers from the dovish Labor party and its left-wing
partners made good on a promise to back the premier in parliament,
at least until the new accord signed Friday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, is implemented.
	   ``We believe the prime minister should be removed from office
and we believe in early elections ... but we will not trade our
principles for political gain. For the sake of peace, we will not
allow (Netanyahu) to fall,'' said Labor lawmaker Eli Goldshmidt,
explaining to parliament why his party did not vote against the
premier Monday.
	   The no-confidence motion brought by the tiny extreme right-wing
Moledet party failed to pass with eight votes for, 21 against and
15 abstentions. A majority of the 120 lawmakers, including
Netanyahu, did not even show up for the vote, which had almost no
chance of passing.
	   Labor's Knesset support is key to Netanyahu who faces growing
opposition to the peace plan from within his own coalition
government. But hardliners opposed to the West Bank withdrawal and
opposition legislators hoping to bring down Netanyahu agreed Monday
to join forces for early national elections.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government, the
Knesset Law Committee voted to hold a first reading on a bill to
disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days,
suggesting the date for the elections was March 16, after the
current peace accord is to be implemented.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by 60 of the 120
legislators. Supporters of the bill said they were confident they
could pass the legislation.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli police said they found the body of a murdered
Palestinian man outside of the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the
West Bank. Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the body was
discovered after an anonymous caller speaking in Hebrew said that a
Palestinian had been killed in revenge for the Hebron murder
earlier in the day.
	   Israel TV identifed the deceased man as Mohammed Zalmouk, a
Palestinian from a neighboring village who works in the olive
groves outside of Itamar. Menuhin said it was not yet clear how the
man was killed and that police were investigating.

Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The European Union on Monday said EU monitors
will make up about two-thirds of the 2,000-strong unarmed ground
force verifying compliance with the Kosovo peace agreement.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe on Sunday formally established the Kosovo
Verification Mission (KVM), hours after the U.N. Security Council
approved it.
	   A Security Council resolution adopted late Saturday endorsed the
agreement to allow the unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo and to let
NATO verify from the air that fighting stopped.
	   In it, the Security Council demanded that Yugoslavia abide by
the accord to end fighting in Kosovo and said action may be needed
to ensure the safety of the international monitors.
	   In Luxembourg, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on
Monday listed the number of participants EU countries have said
they will commit:
	   Britain - 200
	   Germany - 200
	   Italy - between 150 and 200
	   France - between 150 and 200
	   Portugal - 30
	   Sweden - 80
	   Greece, Austria and Denmark - 50 each
	   Luxembourg - 12
	   No figures were given for the other five countries in the EU.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot
three times and his body dumped in downtown Hebron on Monday in an
apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the slaying.
The dead man was found sprawled face down on the pavement, a pool
of blood flowing from his head.
	   Hours later, police found the body of a Palestinian man near the
Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank. The body was found
after police received an anonymous phone call from a man speaking
in Hebrew who said a Palestinian had been killed and his body left
near Itamar to avenge the Hebron slaying.
	   Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and
especially since the signing of the new peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington last week.
	   Israel TV identifed the dead Palestinian as Mohammed Zalmouk, a
65-year-old from a neighboring Palestinian village who worked in
the olive groves outside Itamar. The dead Israeli was identified as
29-year-old Daniel Vargas.
	   The killing in Hebron occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon GMT)
in the downtown Shaaba neighborhood, an area under Israeli control
about 400 yards (meters) from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Paul McCartney calls on women to check for breast cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney said Monday that every woman
should make screening for breast cancer a priority.
	   ''Unfortunately in Linda's case, we really got to it too late,''
McCartney said during an interview on ITN television.
	   Linda McCartney died in April at the McCartney family's Arizona
ranch after suffering from breast cancer. She was 56.
	   ``Although we had two-and-a-half years of treatment it really
turned out to be nothing much we could have done about it,'' the
former Beatles star said.
	   His interview coincided with the release of Wide Prairie, an
album of solo songs recorded by Linda McCartney over the last 25
years.
	   ``Even though you think you may be being a bit too fussy, or
even though the doctor tells you you're being a bit too fussy, it's
worth getting it checked, because the sooner you get to it the more
they can do about it,'' McCartney said.
	   ``So if there's any chance that you might have it, get checks,
that's the main thing.''

New accord is tested with slaying of settler in West Bank town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JRL105-7
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The body of the young Israeli settler
lay sprawled in a pool of blood on the dusty street, one foot clad
only in a sock. Angry Jewish settlers and grim-faced Israeli
soldiers milled about nearby.
	   Monday's execution-style killing in the divided town of Hebron
was the first slaying of an Israeli in the West Bank since the
signing of the new land-for-security agreement. And it also marked
a key first test of the accord.
	   Hard-line Jewish settlers, who say ceding more West Bank land to
the Palestinians endangers their very existence, reacted with fury,
staging a noisy demonstration Monday night outside Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's residence.
	   Chillingly, the Hebron killing might also have led to
tit-for-tat reprisal: hours later, a Palestinian olive farmer was
found slain under mysterious circumstances in the northern West
Bank.
	   Netanyahu condemned the killing of 29-year-old settler Danny
Vargas and said it showed the need for an all-out war on terror by
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Under the accord signed last
week at the White House, Palestinian police are to actively hunt
Islamic militants who stage attacks on Israelis.
	   In this case, early signs were that they were trying hard to do
so.
	   Recent months have seen at least half a dozen attacks involving
assailants who slipped into Israel or Israeli-controlled areas and
then fled into Palestinian-run territory. That was the pattern
again Monday.
	   Gunmen pumped at least three shots into Vargas, a security
guard, leaving his bleeding body in an Israeli-controlled
neighborhood not far from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba,
where he lived, and the power station where he worked.
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian forces launched an immediate
manhunt. Palestinian police found Vargas' white Mitsubishi
abandoned in an arid field, its passenger seat soaked with blood
and the dead man's missing sneaker inside.
	   The car was in a Palestinian-run area, where Israeli troops are
not allowed to go under existing agreements. But Palestinian
officials quickly escorted them to the scene.
	   Together, a knot of officials from both sides _ Israeli police
officers, plainclothes agents, Palestinian intelligence officers,
Israeli soldiers _ inspected the car, searching it and taking
photographs.
	   During the past year and a half, such a scene would have been
almost unthinkable. As a deadlock in the peace talks dragged on,
Palestinian security forces had suspended such cooperation with
Israeli counterparts.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian preventive security in the
Gaza Strip, acknowledged it would take time for the two sides to
re-establish the kind of working partnership envisioned under the
accord.
	   ``Seventeen months of no security relationship between us and
the Israelis is not an easy thing,'' he told the Palestinian
newspaper al-Ayyam. ``We committed to start this process with a
positive attitude _ but if this is not met with a positive attitude
by the Israelis, we shall return to the period before the
agreement.''
	   One of the testing grounds will likely be Hebron. With 500
Jewish settlers living in the center of a city of 130,000
Palestinians, it is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   In August, an elderly rabbi was slain in a Hebron settler
enclave, and the city center was put under curfew for 12 days
earlier this month after grenades were tossed at a military jeep.
The curfew was re-imposed on parts of Hebron Monday night.
	   It remains to be seen whether even a show of good faith on the
part of Palestinian police _ cooperating with Israel, arresting and
convicting killers, putting them behind bars and keeping them there
_ will do much to mollify the settlers, particularly the ones
living in and around Hebron, who have a reputation for militancy.
	   Hours after the killing, about 200 settlers, many from Kiryat
Arba, staged a raucous demonstration outside the prime minister's
residence. They scuffled with the police, who detained at least 16
of them.
	   Many demonstrators planned to attend Vargas' funeral the next
day. ``I don't want to be next!'' some screamed.

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador ended a half-century
dispute Monday by signing a peace treaty that settles ownership of
a slice of Amazon jungle the neighboring countries fought two wars
to control.
	   The presidents and foreign ministers of both countries signed
the accord at a ceremony in Brazil's capital, where most of the
peace talks took place.
	   The United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile brokered the
treaty, which demarcates the border in a 77-kilometer (48-mile)
section of the Andean foothills. Peru and Ecuador both claimed the
area, which was left undefined after a 1941 border war. The two
countries fought over the strip of land in 1981 and 1995.
	   Monday's agreement lays ``the cement of peace,'' said Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori.
	   ``Now we should start to build the building, beautiful and
inhabitable,'' he said at the signing ceremony.
	   In a gesture of reconciliation, Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad
gave Fujimori a canteen used by Ecuadoran soldiers during the 1941
war.
	   ``The Amazon could have been destroyed by a war. Now we preserve
it with a peace accord,'' Mahuad said.
	   Mahuad and Fujimori also signed a separate agreement dealing
with cooperation on security, energy, tourism and trade.
	   The peace treaty draws the border along the heights of the
Cordillera del Condor mountain range, as Peru wanted.
	   But it grants a hill within Peruvian territory to Ecuador's
government. The 100-hectare (250-acre) hill area, known as
Tiwintza, is of great symbolic importance to Ecuador because its
soldiers successfully defended it against Peruvian forces during
the 1995 war.
	   In northern Peru on Saturday, protesters angry about losing
possession of the hill set fire to government trucks and offices.
Three people were trampled to death when police dispersed the crowd
of 5,000 with tear gas bombs in the jungle city of Iquitos, 970
kilometers (600 miles) northeast of Lima.
	   Ecuador and Peru began peace talks in 1995. After years of slow
progress, the presidents of the two nations met in August to work
out the final details.
	   As a condition for brokering the talks, the United States and
the other three sponsors insisted that Peru and Ecuador accept
whatever outcome was reached.
	   ``I think this is going to ... unleash a lot of investment in
the private sector, in the linkage of pipelines, for instance,''
said U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi. ``Ecuador has a lot of oil under the
ground that it can't get out, and Peru has a pipeline that is half
full.''
	   The treaty also calls for contiguous national parks to be
created in the disputed area.
	   ``It's been a good week for peace accords ... Israel and now
this,'' said Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a U.S. envoy at the talks and
a former aide to President Clinton, who attended the signing
ceremony.

Beijing warns it will not bail out foreign banks, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Chinese government warned foreign banks that
they should not expect Beijing to bail out their loans to bankrupt
financial companies, the Financial Times newspaper reported in
Monday's editions.
	   Xiang Huaicheng, the finance minister, told the newspaper that
Beijing will not be acting as a guarantor of last resort. Foreign
banks have lent the recently failed Guandong International Trust
and Investment Corporation and other investment companies
throughout China more than dlrs 10 billion. And Xiang said he
expects the number of failed investment companies to grow.
	   ``Local government does not have the qualification or the
resources to guarantee these loans. I say to governors of the
province, even I do not dare to provide these guarantees, so how
dare you,'' Xiang told the newspaper. ``Then I just say, the
foreign bankers themselves should look really carefully at these
loans.''
	   Xiang's warning will come as a shock to foreign bankers, many of
whom expected the Chinese government to assume responsibility for
honoring the loans, the newspaper said.
	   But the government's hard line may also improve the health of
China's financial system by forcing other investment groups to
guard against corruption and ineptitude to protect the foreign
loans, the newspaper reported.
	   ``We announced to the whole world that we are doing something
real now to reform our financial system. We are also giving a big
warning to all the international trust and investment corporations
across the provinces,'' Xiang told the newspaper. ``And this is
also a lesson to investors and foreign bankers that before you
provide these loans you should study Chinese laws carefully.''

Interpol updates terrorism guidelines

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conference updating terrorism guidelines,
deciding to hold next meeting in Seoul &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Interpol on Monday approved an Egyptian
proposal that calls on police agencies to share information as part
of the international fight against terrorism.
	   The agency separately revised its guidelines for combating
terrorism.
	   While Interpol officials refused to reveal details of their new
counter-terrorism strategy, they emphasized that member states
should share information on wanted terrorists.
	   The decisions taken during the 67th General Assembly of Interpol
``send a clear message to all countries who support terrorism or
help in financing'' terrorist operations, said Serageddin Rabie,
Interpol's vice president for the Middle East and Africa.
	   The meeting of international police officials brought together
some 500 delegates from 140 member states.
	   The Egyptian proposal ratified by the assembly calls for
increased cooperation to fight terrorism and the holding of an
international conference on terrorism.
	   The proposal stressed the need to ``overcome obstacles impeding
the handing over of terrorists,'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Egypt, which has suffered major attacks from Islamic militants,
has been lobbying for such a summit, arguing that terrorism is a
global phenomenon.
	   Late last year, Islamic militants killed 67 tourists in two
separate attacks.
	   The assembly also admitted the Comoro Islands as a new member,
and agreed to hold its 1999 meeting in Seoul, South Korea.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Crippled by scandal, Colombia's previous
president was stripped of his U.S. visa in mid-tenure.
	   By contrast, President Andres Pastrana is expected to get a warm
welcome Tuesday when he arrives in Washington for the first state
visit by a Colombian president in 23 years.
	   U.S. relations with this violent, drug-producing nation improved
radically with the June election of Pastrana, who immediately
embarked on a full-tilt quest for peace with leftist rebels.
	   The normalized, broadened relationship could be damaged,
however, by Pastrana's insistence on de-emphasizing drug crop
eradication.
	   He is trying to end a 34-year civil conflict with leftist
guerrillas whose insurgency is bankrolled in large part by taxing
drug production in vast areas of Colombia's countryside.
	   After he arrives in Washington for his three-day visit, Pastrana
will have a lot of explaining to do.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the government sent Air Force planes to pluck residents off of
remote Caribbean islands Monday as the season's most powerful
hurricane swirled toward Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with
winds of 170 mph (275 kph). At 1700 GMT, Mitch's center was 55
miles (90 kilometers) east-southeast of Honduras' Swan Island and
was moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
statement from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Jerry Jarrell, director of the center, said it was the strongest
hurricane since Gilbert in 1988.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of alert. He
told residents of coastal areas to leave their homes for more
secure ground inland, but didn't tell them where to stay.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
north of the capital.
	   San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they might set up
shelters in public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at gas stations under a steady rain.
	   Maria Gonzalez bought only 5 lempiras (37 cents) worth of gas,
saying it was all she could afford. She needed the gasoline to cook
in case her firewood gets wet, she said.
	   ``I have six children and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all of the Air Force's planes to evacuate
people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off
the coast of central Honduras.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on the island of Utila, said he
had tied up his boats and was planning to take his family to higher
ground, to stay with a relative. Speaking by telephone, he said
most tourists had left on Sunday but that some were stuck, and that
hotels were moving tourists to houses in the mountains.
	   Before moving toward Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the
Caymans. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital of
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Cayman
Islands, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast on Sunday
night, and the outer winds of the hurricane were expected to sweep
along the coast on Monday and Tuesday.
	   Flores ordered all public offices closed on the Atlantic coast
as of noon Monday, and canceled all classes at public and private
schools. Health officials sent medicine to public hospitals along
the coast.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs in the northern
zone,'' said Vice President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be
benevolent with Hondurans.''
	   In 1974, Hurricane Fifi swept Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing
at least 2,000 people and destroying 70 percent of the country's
infrastructure.

New accord is tested with slaying of settler in West Bank town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JRL105-107, JRL115 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The body of the young Israeli settler
lay sprawled in a pool of blood on the dusty street, one foot clad
only in a sock. Angry Jewish settlers and grim-faced Israeli
soldiers milled about nearby.
	   Monday's execution-style killing in the divided town of Hebron
was the first slaying of an Israeli in the West Bank since the
signing of the new land-for-security agreement. And it also marked
a key first test of the accord.
	   Hard-line Jewish settlers, who say ceding more West Bank land to
the Palestinians endangers their very existence, reacted with fury,
staging a noisy demonstration Monday night outside Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's residence.
	   Chillingly, the Hebron killing might also have led to
tit-for-tat reprisal: Hours later, a Palestinian olive farmer was
found slain under mysterious circumstances in the northern West
Bank.
	   Netanyahu condemned the killing of 29-year-old settler Danny
Vargas and said it showed the need for an all-out war on terror by
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Under the accord signed last
week at the White House, Palestinian police are to actively hunt
Islamic militants who stage attacks on Israelis.
	   In this case, early signs were that they were trying hard to do
so.
	   Recent months have seen at least half a dozen attacks involving
assailants who slipped into Israel or Israeli-controlled areas and
then fled into Palestinian-run territory. That was the pattern
again Monday.
	   Gunmen pumped at least three shots into Vargas, a security
guard, leaving his bleeding body in an Israeli-controlled
neighborhood not far from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba,
where he lived, and the power station where he worked.
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian forces launched an immediate
manhunt. Palestinian police found Vargas' white Mitsubishi
abandoned in an arid field, its passenger seat soaked with blood
and the dead man's missing sneaker inside.
	   The car was in a Palestinian-run area, where Israeli troops are
not allowed to go under existing agreements. But Palestinian
officials quickly escorted them to the scene.
	   Together, a knot of officials from both sides _ Israeli police
officers, plainclothes agents, Palestinian intelligence officers,
Israeli soldiers _ inspected the car, searching it and taking
photographs.
	   During the past year and a half, such a scene would have been
almost unthinkable. As a deadlock in the peace talks dragged on,
Palestinian security forces had suspended such cooperation with
Israeli counterparts.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian preventive security in the
Gaza Strip, acknowledged it would take time for the two sides to
re-establish the kind of working partnership envisioned under the
accord.
	   ``Seventeen months of no security relationship between us and
the Israelis is not an easy thing,'' he told the Palestinian
newspaper al-Ayyam. ``We committed to start this process with a
positive attitude _ but if this is not met with a positive attitude
by the Israelis, we shall return to the period before the
agreement.''
	   One of the testing grounds will likely be Hebron. With 500
Jewish settlers living in the center of a city of 130,000
Palestinians, it is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   In August, an elderly rabbi was slain in a Hebron settler
enclave, and the city center was put under curfew for 12 days
earlier this month after grenades were tossed at a military jeep.
The curfew was re-imposed on parts of Hebron Monday night.
	   It remains to be seen whether even a show of good faith on the
part of Palestinian police _ cooperating with Israel, arresting and
convicting killers, putting them behind bars and keeping them there
_ will do much to mollify the settlers, particularly the ones
living in and around Hebron, who have a reputation for militancy.
	   Hours after the killing, about 200 settlers, many from Kiryat
Arba, staged a raucous demonstration outside the prime minister's
residence. They scuffled with the police, who detained at least 16
of them.
	   Many demonstrators planned to attend Vargas' funeral the next
day. ``I don't want to be next!'' some screamed.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More cases of typhoid have been reported in the
southern Russian region of Dagestan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Monday.
	   Twenty-six people, including eight children, have been
hospitalized with symptoms of the disease, ITAR-Tass said, quoting
the press office of the Emergencies Ministry.
	   Twenty-one confirmed cases have been reported, it said.
	   The outbreak was blamed on sewage getting into the water system.
	   Local officials health officials tried to downplay the outbreak.
``There is no reason for panic in connection with the abdominal
typhoid cases,'' said Dagestan's acting health minister,
Dzhamalutdin Gasayev, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Dozens were sickened by typhoid in Dagestan this summer.
	   Typhoid is an extremely infectious disease caused by ingesting
dirty food or water. It is characterized by fever and intestinal
disorders.

First ex-communist wins top parliament post in Germany

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The former East German communists won their
highest political post since the fall of the Berlin Wall on Monday
when one of their members was elected a vice president of
parliament.
	   Backed by the center-left majority that emerged from last
month's election, Petra Blaess defeated a rival candidate put
forward out of protest by the Christian Democrats of outgoing
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   In Germany, parties that gain more than 5 percent of the
national vote have a right to nominate a parliamentary vice
president. The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism got the
chance after clearing the hurdle in the Sept. 27 election.
	   Blaess, 34, was the only one of the five candidates to face an
opponent during the voting in the new parliament's opening session.
She defeated Michaela Geiger, a Bavarian conservative, by a 355-285
vote.
	   Blaess was the electoral commissioner for East Germany's only
free election under communism in March 1990, five months after the
Berlin Wall fell.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ A month after state elections, leftist
Social Democrats and ex-communist politicians in
Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania returned to negotiations Monday
evening to form a government.
	   Both sides say they hope to finalize an agreement on finances,
and a works and social benefits program to form the first
government at German state level that would include the
ex-communists as full-fledged coalition partners.
	   The Social Democrats finished on top in state elections in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Sept. 27, but must form a
coalition to achieve a majority in parliament. The Party of
Democratic Socialism finished a strong third.
	   Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff has been pushing to come to
agreement on a coalition with the PDS, the successor to former East
Germany's old party of Social Unity.
	   The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German
state, Saxony-Anhalt, since spring with the tacit support of the
PDS, but the party has never officially been part of a coalition
government.
	   Social Democratic leaders have ruled out working with the PDS at
the federal level, but have said that having the ex-communists
shoulder responsibility at the state level may prove beneficial in
the eastern states.

In tuition protest, university students clash with police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Thousands of university students clashed
with police Monday in the second day of demonstrations to protest
tuition fees.
	   Police officers dragged students and pushed them off the street
outside Tel Aviv university after students tried to block a major
road, Israel TV reported. Police said eight students were arrested.
	   In Beersheba, a student leader from Ben Gurion University was
expelled from the city and banned from returning for a week, Israel
radio said.
	   ``Yaakov, resign!'' students shouted, calling for the
resignation of Yaakov Neeman, the treasury minister who has refused
their demands to subsidize 50 percent of the annual undergraduate
tuition fee of dlrs 3000.
	   Under heavy criticism for their handling of Sunday's
demonstrations in which police beat back students with clubs,
police said that clubs were not used to disperse the protesters
Monday.
	   Student demonstrators have been blocking entrances to all but
university workers since the strike began Sunday, the day the
academic year was to open.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won a
no-confidence motion Monday in parliament, getting past the first
of several political hurdles aimed at challenging a new Mideast
peace deal.
	   The threat of early elections loomed after legislators decided
to present a bill to parliament calling for a spring vote.
	   Selling the new land-for-peace deal to hard-liners in his
coalition government has not been easy. Monday's brutal killing of
a Jewish settler, apparently by Palestinians, in the West Bank city
of Hebron was likely to make the process even harder.
	   In a demonstration outside the Netanyahu's home later Monday,
hundreds of right-wing Israelis carried torches and angry signs
calling for Netanyahu's resignation. Many chanted ``Bibi is a
traitor,'' referring to the prime minister by his nickname.
	   Some protesters scuffled with police and tried to break through
a barrier. Police said 21 people were arrested.
	   Still, lawmakers from the dovish Labor party and its left-wing
partners made good on a promise to back the premier in parliament,
at least until the new accord signed Friday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat is implemented.
	   ``We believe the prime minister should be removed from office
and we believe in early elections ... but we will not trade our
principles for political gain. For the sake of peace, we will not
allow'' Netanyahu to fall, Labor lawmaker Eli Goldshmidt said.
	   The no-confidence motion brought by the tiny, extreme right-wing
Moledet party failed to pass, with eight votes in favor, 21 against
and 15 abstentions.
	   A majority of the 120 lawmakers, including Netanyahu, did not
show up for the vote, which had almost no chance of passing.
	   Labor's Knesset support is key to Netanyahu, who faces growing
opposition to the peace plan from within his own coalition
government.
	   Hard-liners opposed to the West Bank withdrawal and opposition
legislators hoping to bring down Netanyahu agreed Monday to join
forces for early national elections.
	   In a first step toward toppling the Netanyahu government, the
Knesset Law Committee voted to hold a first reading on a bill to
disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days. A
suggested date for the elections was March 16, after the current
peace accord is to be implemented.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by 60 of the 120
legislators. Supporters of the bill said they were confident they
could pass the legislation.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli police said they found the body of a
Palestinian man outside of the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the
West Bank. Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the body was
discovered after an anonymous caller speaking in Hebrew said a
Palestinian had been killed in revenge for the Hebron murder
earlier in the day.
	   Israel TV identified the man as Mohammed Zalmouk, a Palestinian
from a neighboring village who works in the olive groves outside of
Itamar. Although he was killed, Menuhin said it was not yet clear
how he died.

Home to Chekhov and Stanislavsky celebrates 100th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The theater that catapulted Anton Chekhov and
Konstantin Stanislavsky onto the world stage turned 100 years old
on Monday, and much of Moscow helped it celebrate.
	   The Moscow Art Theater gained widespread acclaim after the
success of one of its first plays, Chekhov's ``The Seagull,'' in
1898, and went on to become one of the century's most influential
theaters.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, leading members of
parliament, Russia's top theater and film directors and its most
renowned actors attended the theater's anniversary celebrations
Monday in the elegant building within sight of the Kremlin.
	   Dignitaries performed parodies of famous plays presented at the
theater, including Chekhov classics. Others recited odes to the
theater, some sentimental, others comic.
	   Stanislavsky, a director and actor, founded the theater with
colleague Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and developed the Method
style of acting, which was later adopted by leading directors and
actors in New York and Hollywood.
	   The Method trains actors to forgo mimicry and other stage
conventions relied upon by 19th-century actors, instead encouraging
them to study the inner lives of the characters, as if they were
real people.
	   Many Russians refer to the theater as the Chekhov Theater,
because it was there that the playwright first enjoyed fame for his
works chronicling the broken dreams and stagnation of the Russian
middle-class.
	   The Moscow Art Theater continued to thrive in the Soviet era,
but is no longer the trend-setter it once was. It is now among many
renowned institutions in Russia's richest city facing cutbacks
because of the country's grinding economic problems.

Spanish observers allege army complicity in Chiapas massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A massacre of 45 Tzotzil Indians in southern
Chiapas state last year could not have taken place without the
complicity of some army members, a group of leftist Spanish
observers said Monday after a five-day visit to the state.
	   A Spanish delegation led by Willy Meyer, a legislator from the
United Left coalition, toured the area this week where the
Zapatista National Liberation Army rebelled in 1994. They plan to
deliver a report to the European Parliament and the United Nations
in two weeks.
	   ``The massacre could not have taken place without the complicity
of members of the army,'' Meyer said at a news conference in Mexico
City.
	   The Indians were killed by members of a pro-government
paramilitary group in the hamlet of Acteal, less than 2 kilometers
(a mile) from a state police station.
	   A military spokesman who identified himself only as Col. Aguilar
declined to comment on the allegations, saying the massacre was
being investigated by federal prosecutors.
	   More than 150 people have been charged in the massacre,
including 12 former officials of the state government.
	   The military's presence in Chiapas has grown steadily since
1994, and Mexican legislators have complained that the government
has not told them how many troops are stationed there.
	   ``The unusually large number of troops in Chiapas are trying to
control the population, and that is not the function of the army in
a democratic society,'' Meyer said.
	   The Spanish delegation was stopped at military checkpoints 12
times in just four days, he said.
	   Mexico's opposition-led Congress has repeatedly criticized the
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo over the growing
military presence in Chiapas.
	   Peace talks between the government and the Zapatista rebels have
been stalled since 1996, when the Zedillo administration refused to
honor a partial peace accord signed by government representatives.
	   The Zapatistas rose up in arms to seek better treatment for the
state's poor Indians.

Sampras under pressure as others close the gap on No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Rafter's ranking in 11th graf to No. 3 &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ With less than a month remaining
before the season-ending World Championship, the battle for No. 1
in men's tennis is heating up and several players have a chance of
dethroning Pete Sampras.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row. He now shares the record of five with Jimmy
Connors.
	   But as the crowded tennis schedule draws to a close, Sampras'
rule is under siege. Even Andre Agassi, who was ranked No. 140 at
this time last year, is still in contention to reclaim the No. 1.
	   Although he won Wimbledon for the fifth time this summer,
Sampras has had a mediocre year, at least by his standards. He won
only four titles and no other Grand Slams apart from Wimbledon.
	   Securing the No. 1 for the sixth year in a row is now Sampras'
goal.
	   ``It's a very important goal that I'm trying to achieve,''
Sampras said before the dlrs 2.45 million Eurocard Open, which
started Monday in Stuttgart.
	   ``So, I'll do whatever I have to do to make it. If it means
being away from home for five weeks, so be it,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have a chance to make it, and that's really all I can ask
for. It's up to me now.
	   ``I can't really expect the other players to lose. It's
definitely important, and it's something that might never be
achieved again,'' Sampras said.
	   The next couple of weeks will be decisive in the battle for No.
1.
	   The main challenge to Sampras comes from No. 2 Marcelo Rios, who
leads the tour with seven titles this years, and No. 3 Patrick
Rafter, who won his second consecutive U.S. Open title in
September.
	   Sampras and Rios both come to Stuttgart nursing injuries after
dropping out of the event in Lyon last week, Sampras with a back
strain, Rios with left-leg hamstring injury.
	   Like all top eight seeds in Stuttgart, Sampras and Rios have
first-round byes.
	   But even Agassi and seven other players still have at least a
mathematical chance of clinching the No. 1 spot. One of them is
Carlos Moya, the fourth-ranked French Open champion.
	   Agassi has shot to No. 5 after his victory Sunday in Ostrava,
the Czech Republic. It was his fifth title of the year and a
tour-high 10th final of the season.
	   He also leads the tour with 65 match victories this year and his
record stands at 65-15. At this time last year, he was 12-12 and
playing challenger tournaments in an attempt to fight back into the
top ranks after what had looked like a career-threatening slump.
	   With his victory in Ostrava, Agassi has qualified for the
eight-man field at next month's World Championship in Hanover,
Germany.
	   Alex Corretja became the sixth player to qualify by winning the
tournament in Lyon on Sunday.

At least 21 killed in two paramilitary attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Colombia-Pastrana Visit &QL; 
 &UR; By JAVIER BAENA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Paramilitary fighters selectively killed
21 people in attacks on two villages widely interpreted as
rejections of President Andres Pastrana's peace overtures to
leftist rebels, authorities said Monday.
	   In both weekend incursions, the paramilitary death squads
arrived with lists in hand, sought out alleged guerrilla
sympathizers and hauled them away, killing them outside town,
witnesses reported.
	   Eleven of the victims were seized in Altos del Rosario, 430
kilometers (270 miles) north of Bogota late Sunday, the other 10
were residents of San Carlos, a village 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of the capital, national police director Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano said.
	   ``This is regrettable because it offers nothing to the great
effort President Pastrana is making for peace,'' Serrano said.
	   In the Saturday night raid on San Carlos, the United
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, the country's main paramilitary
force, left graffiti on the walls of public buildings rejecting
concessions Pastrana has made to rebels in an effort to get a peace
dialogue started.
	   Police in San Carlos exchanged gunfire with the paramilitary
fighters, killing one.
	   The mayor of Altos del Rosario, Sen Rodriguez, said the
paramilitaries arrived in his town with a list of 40 people. He
told Caracol Radio that he and other mayors from the region have
been forced to flee to Cartagena, the Bolivar state capital,
because of threats from both paramilitary groups and rebels.
	   Pastrana has made peace his nearly three-month-old government's
priority, agreeing to withdraw troops from an area of southern
Colombia the size of Switzerland by Nov. 7 to facilitate talks with
leftist rebels.
	   He has refused so far to grant the same political status to
paramilitary groups, which were first formed more than a decade ago
by ranchers and large landholders in a response to rebel kidnapping
and extortion.

Bosnian envoy says top priority is to get 120,000 refugees home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Dissatisfied at the slow pace of refugee
returns, the international envoy to Bosnia told the U.N. Security
Council Monday his top priority is to get 120,000 people who fled
during the war back in their homes next year.
	   ``We have to accelerate and put the emphasis on refugee returns
next year,'' Carlos Westerndorp told reporters after briefing the
council. ``We have to put all our efforts in achieving this
figure.''
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had forecast that 1998
would be the year that Bosnian refugees returned to areas dominated
by different ethnic groups. But only half the 50,000 refugees
expected to return have actually made it home, he said.
	   ``Refugee return is not happening ... because the people do not
feel safe if they return to areas which are dominated by a
different ethnic group because the police are not democratic and
are not multi-ethnic and the judges are not trustworthy,''
Westendorp said.
	   He said the election of more moderate leaders in Bosnia in
September, and efforts by his office to restructure the police and
create an independent judiciary, were key to reaching the target of
returning 120,000 refugees.
	   Westendorp said he asked the Security Council for increased
manpower and funding for the U.N. police force in Bosnia, but had
not yet gotten a response.
	   Some 2,000 U.N. civilian police currently train and monitor
officers from the Serb, Muslim and Croat communities and oversee
refugee returns and the building of institutions in the
Muslim-Croat and Serb-controlled halves of Bosnia.
	   Security Council president Jeremy Greenstock said council
members ``underlined the need for an overall solution of problems
related to refugee returns'' in Bosnia.
	   The council also welcomed Bosnia's successful elections ``as
another important step in the peace process,'' said Greenstock, the
British ambassador.
	   While Bosnians generally elected more moderate politicians,
Western officials were dismayed that the new president of the
Serb-held entity, Nikola Poplasen, heads an ultra-nationalist
party.
	   Westendorp said it was ``a bit too soon'' to say whether
Poplasen was complying with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which
ended the Bosnian war, a demand reiterated by the Security Council.
	   ``He says he will comply with Dayton and I will take him at his
word. We will see if his acts correspond to his words. Otherwise,
we'll have to take the necessary steps,'' Westendorp said.
	   The Spanish envoy has been given authority by Western powers to
impose laws or remove officials on his own if not satisfied with
the response of local leaders.
	   He said Poplasen's first step must be to appoint a moderate
government which will receive support from the majority of the
Bosnian Serb assembly.
	   He also warned that those municipalities that facilitate refugee
returns will receive international support and those that don't
will have ``no support whatsoever.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The day started like so many others for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl: A helicopter ride back to Bonn after a
weekend in his home state, and a meeting with trusted aides.
	   But when Monday was over, the man who guided Germany and Europe
through historic changes over the last 16 years was no longer
Germany's iron-willed leader, but just one of 669 lawmakers serving
in the newly confirmed parliament.
	   German President Roman Herzog presented Kohl with the highest
honor bestowed on a German citizen, the Federal Cross of Merit with
laurels, honoring his ``service to Germany and Europe.'' The only
other person ever to receive the award was postwar leader Konrad
Adenauer.
	   ``The new political order at the end of this century bears your
handwriting,'' Herzog told Kohl during a ceremony at the
president's residence, the Palais Schaumburg. ``That Germany, for
the first time in its history, lives with all of its neighbors in
peace, freedom and friendship is your biggest and most lasting
legacy.''
	   Kohl accepted the award with emotion. And if there was any
bitterness at being voted out of power, Kohl hid it.
	   ``There's no looking back in anger,'' Kohl said. ``They were 16
powerful years, good years, with lots and lots of work.''
	   The special award of merit was another extraordinary honor for a
leader who through sheer determination pushed Germany into the
center of a united Europe that enjoys open borders and launches a
common currency in a monetary union _ though not a political one
Kohl once championed _ on Jan. 1.
	   Kohl's goals when he was sworn into office on Oct. 1, 1982
seemed even then grandiose: to station nuclear-tipped Pershing II
missiles in Germany against the threat of Soviet missiles, to
deepen European integration and to unify communist East Germany
with West Germany.
	   Today, they are all facts of history, and products of Kohl's
personal desire to see Germany viewed as a trusted ally, not a
feared neighbor.
	   With the Cold War ended, the degree of controversy stirred by
Kohl's determination to station missiles in Germany has faded. But
besides demonstrating the depth of Germany's relationship with the
United States and the Western allies, it did have one lasting
legacy: opposition to the warheads gave political impetus to the
fledgling environmental Greens party, a partner in the government
that succeeds Kohl's.
	   Kohl's commitment to tighter integration of Europe can be traced
to his awareness of the history of his home state,
Rhineland-Palatinate, through which, he noted, ``hordes of people
and armies passed for 2,000 years.'' Growing up near the French
border contributed to Kohl's desire for a close relationship with
the neighbor, which he nurtured through his friendship with former
French President Francois Mitterrand.
	   When Kohl first uttered the pledge of German unification, it
seemed the folly of an idealist. In West Germany, the divided
nation was accepted as the price Germans must pay for Hitler's war.
Divided, Germany did not look threatening.
	   But eight years later it was achieved, with the world's blessing
and largely due to the personal relationships Kohl had fostered
with world leaders: Mikhail Gorbachev, George Bush, and Francois
Mitterrand.
	   German unification remains Kohl's greatest accomplishment.
	   After ceding his office during a ceremony Monday, Kohl's future
role remains uncertain.
	   He claims he will gladly resume the role of a lawmaker. Some
wonder, though, how a man accustomed to enormous power at home and
influence abroad can become another face in parliament.
	   Kohl's achievements were attained through tight control of both
his party and his government. There was no room for dissent. And
critics often claim his strength allowed little room for younger
members to modernize the party _ and possibly offer a candidate who
might have kept the conservatives in power.
	   ``Kohl was an oak tree,'' longtime party critic Kurt Biedenkopf
has said. ``Nothing grows under such trees.''

Harrods owner sued for allegedly breaking into safe-deposit box
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Court proceedings began Monday involving Mohamed
Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, who is being sued for allegedly
breaking into a safe-deposit box in the department store.
	   Josephine Rowland, the widow of Al Fayed's former business
competitor Tiny Rowland, is pursuing her late husband's lawsuit
against Al Fayed and three other Harrods employees. Rowland, the
loser in a bitter battle with Al Fayed for control of the famous
store, died in July.
	   Christopher Moger, the lawyer representing Mrs. Rowland,
contends that Al Fayed persuaded employees at Harrods to break into
the Rowland's safe-deposit box in 1995. The Harrods boss wanted to
use material he found to blackmail Rowland into helping him
overturn a Department of Trade and Industry report into his 1985
takeover of Harrods, Moger said. The report was highly critical of
Al Fayed.
	   This summer, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to pursue
criminal charges against Al Fayed, saying ''there is no realistic
prospect of conviction for any criminal offenses.''
	   While Al Fayed denies breaking in to the safe-deposit box, the
defense issued a statement Monday saying, ''The defendants do not
contend they were authorized to open the box and copy documents and
regret any distress caused.'' Al Fayed has blamed a former Harrods
employee, who is not named in the lawsuit because he alerted the
Rowlands to the alleged break-in, Moger said.
	   The hearing is expected to last two weeks.
	   Al Fayed's son Dodi was killed with Princess Diana in a car
crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997.

U.S, EU optimistic that gap with EU on data privacy can be bridged

 &UR; Eds: EDITS to tighten. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is toughening rules
protecting the privacy of personal data of its 370 million
citizens, threatening a trade skirmish with American companies that
buy and sell such information.
	   Electronic trade and U.S. companies marketing personal data
faced new obstacles Monday after EU regulations went into effect to
improve and extend protections of private data in the group's 15
nations.
	   Personal data information is an increasingly popular commercial
tool in the United States where a hands-off approach offers limited
privacy protection. In Europe, it is a tiny industry, controlled by
stricter rules.
	   ``The U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' said a U.S.
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The two sides are holding discussions to try to defuse the
issue. And EU officials said Monday that member nations supported
efforts to try to reach a compromise with Washington by year-end.
	   The American diplomat said if the negotiations proved fruitless
and the EU rules hurt U.S. businesses, Washington intended to file
a complaint at the World Trade Organization.
	   The dispute raises questions about what would happen to
international banking and credit card businesses and Internet
commerce if the trans-Atlantic data laws fail to dovetail.
	   Personal data including addresses, ages, buying habits and
income brackets are bought and sold by list brokers in the EU as
well as in the United States. Brokers sell the lists to companies
looking for specific demographic groups for their products.
	   The issue underlines the differences between the United States
and Europe over how privacy is protected.
	   The basic principle of EU rules is that data should be
transferred to a non-EU country only if it will be adequately
protected there, too. American regulations would not provide such
protections.
	   European consumer organizations are concerned about any
compromise that would be reached with Washington.
	   ``The solution proposed by business and the U.S. administration
would not give European consumers the rights they have under (EU
rules) when their data is exported to the United States,'' said Jim
Murray, the director of the European consumers group BEUC.
	   The regulations have already been adopted in Greece and Portugal
and are being implemented in Britain, Sweden and Italy along with
additional rules. They will gradually be put into effect in the
other EU nations.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A French laboratory found decomposed nerve
agent on an Iraqi missile warhead that could be from VX or sarin or
another agent, U.N. and international chemical weapons experts
reported Monday.
	   The experts reconfirmed the validity of tests by a U.S. Army
laboratory in June that found decayed VX nerve agent on missile
warheads.
	   But their report, compiled after a meeting here by chemical
weapons experts from seven countries, also raised new questions
about Iraq's declarations of its chemical weapons program and what
might have happened to a collection of missile fragments after the
U.S. tests.
	   A second round of tests conducted by U.S., French and Swiss labs
found residue of a decayed decontamination compound that wasn't
discovered by the original U.S. tests, the report said.
	   The chemical experts said in the report that there was ``no
obvious explanation,'' for why the original U.S. results didn't
find the decontaminant, the report said.
	   ``Other than for U.N. politics, it's a clear sign that they
tampered with the samples in the interim,'' said David Kay, a
former U.N. weapons inspector who now consults for Science
Applications International Corp., in Washington.
	   The report doesn't suggest tampering, but does say the presence
of the decontamination decay counters Iraq's claim that the 20
missile warheads tested had only been in contact with alcohol.
	   Alcohol shouldn't require any decontamination product to
destroy. That a decontamination product was used suggests that
there might have been something more potent than alcohol inside the
warhead that needed to be eliminated.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which carries out inspections in
Iraq, suggested in the report that Iraq explain what happened to
the fragments that were analyzed and why degradation products of
nerve agents were found on some.
	   The commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them, before the Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify Baghdad had
destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   Butler agreed to conduct a new round of tests in French, Swiss
and U.S. laboratories after Iraq disputed the original U.S. Army
findings.
	   Monday's report didn't say explicitly that VX was found in any
of the new tests. But it did say ``The French laboratory reported
the presence of a degradation product of a nerve agent,'' in one
sample that could be from VX, sarin or soman, another agent.
	   French expert noted that the product could also originate from
detergents, but U.S. experts said they weren't aware of such
compounds having any commercial uses.
	   Iraq claims it was never able to make enough VX, or stabilize it
properly, to load into missiles. VX is a colorless, odorless gas, a
drop of which can kill a person in minutes.
	   The VX question is one of several outstanding issues that
inspectors say they must clarify before they can state that Iraq no
longer has or can produce weapons of mass destruction.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Almost 200 Egyptian students, including 47
children at a school for the blind, were hospitalized Monday with
food poisoning after eating meals provided by their schools, a
newspaper reported.
	   The hospitalizations were the latest in a series of school
poisonings in which at least 1,480 other students have been
hospitalized. Authorities are investigating the incidents.
	   In the southern province of Assiut, 130 students at al-Azhar
religious institute were hospitalized about 90 minutes after eating
halva and bread, the daily Al-Gomhuria newspaper reported in its
early Tuesday edition.
	   In the Nile Delta province of Mansoura, 47 students at the Light
for the Blind School, were hospitalized after eating halva, cheese
and bread, the newspaper reported.
	   Mansoura is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Assiut.
	   Four of the students in Assiut remain in hospital.
	   Earlier this month, 1,480 children were hospitalized after
eating contaminated biscuits in primary, middle and secondary
schools in Mansoura and in Giza province outside of Cairo.
	   Education officials have ordered an investigation into the
producers and distributors of the meals.
	   Water supplies in Mansoura are also being examined, Al-Gomhuria
said.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was shot
three times and his body dumped in downtown Hebron on Monday in an
apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the slaying.
The dead man was found sprawled face down on the pavement, a pool
of blood flowing from his head.
	   Hours later, police found the body of a Palestinian man near the
Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank. The body was found
after police received an anonymous phone call from a man speaking
in Hebrew who said a Palestinian had been killed and his body left
near Itamar to avenge the Hebron slaying.
	   Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as
saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
Israeli troops imposed a curfew over Palestinians under their
control in Hebron, requiring Palestinians to stay inside their
homes.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands Monday in the face of the most
powerful hurricane to threaten Central America in a decade.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with
winds of 180 mph (285 kph). At 2100 GMT, Mitch's center was 35
miles (55 kilometers) southeast of Honduras' Swan Island and was
moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
statement from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   The storm was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for
the next five days, the center said.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of alert and
told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer ground
farther inland.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (180 kms) north of
the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they might set up
shelters in public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations to buy gasoline under a steady rain.
	   Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with in case her
firewood gets wet. She bought only 5 lempiras (37 cents) worth,
saying it was all she could afford.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small
islands off the coast of central Honduras.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on one of the islands, said he had
tied up his boats and was planning to take his family to stay with
a relative on higher ground. Speaking by telephone from Utila, 20
miles (35 kms) north of La Ceiba, he said most tourists had left
the island Sunday but that some were stranded and that hotels were
moving them to houses in the mountains.
	   ``Mitch is closing in, and God help us in the coming hours,''
said Utila Mayor Monterrey Cardenas.
	   Police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta
rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along the eastern Honduran
coast. ``Frightened people are moving into the mountains to search
for shelter,'' he said.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (180 kms) north of Tegucigalpa, the
army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident of
the town.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the
Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast Sunday night,
and the hurricane's outer winds were expected to lash the area on
Monday and Tuesday.
	   Forecasters said they don't expect Mitch to be a Category 5
hurricane by the time it makes landfall.
	   ``We do forecast it to decrease in strength over the next 72
hours,'' said Jeremy Pennington a meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center.
	   That didn't stop Flores Facusse from ordering the closure of all
public offices on the Caribbean coast by noon Monday. He also
canceled classes at all schools there, and health officials sent
medicine to public hospitals.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs,'' said Vice
President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with
Hondurans.''
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at
least 2,000 people.

Two independent dailies halt publishing

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two independent Serbian dailies
halted publishing Monday after police raided the office of another
non-government newspaper to collect a fine for alleged anti-state
activity.
	   Nasa Borba and Danas, both briefly banned by the government
earlier this month, said they would not publish to protest a new
media law they say imposes censorship on the fledgling independent
media.
	   Also Monday, editors of Serbia's independent media announced a
campaign to fight the latest media restrictions imposed by
authorities loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The new law, passed last week, bans foreign media from
broadcasting Serbian-language programs and empowers the authorities
to punish publishers and journalists with hefty fines for any
articles or photos deemed damaging to the state.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, formally abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s, and
threatens to drag the country back to single-party dictatorship.
	   A Belgrade court ruled Friday that Slavko Curuvija, editor of
the daily Dnevni Telegraf, the newspaper's publisher and two other
managers violated the law by publishing an article that accused
Milosevic of introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country
into political and economic chaos.
	   The court imposed fines totaling dlrs 246,000 on the publisher,
Curuvija and the two others.
	   Late Sunday, police raided the newspaper's office, hauling away
equipment to collect the fine. Dozens of desks, telephones and
other equipment were loaded onto trucks and taken away. The police
swoop also prevented the printing of 100,000 copies of Dnevni
Telegraf's Monday issue.
	   Last week's law was passed amid growing anti-Western sentiment
in Yugoslavia, fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end
the crisis in the Serb province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops.
	   The opposition Democratic Party compared the law and other
repressive measures to the former fascist and Communist regimes,
saying ``it is obvious a new period is starting in Serbia in which
the regime will try to spread fear.''

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru and Ecuador ended a half-century
dispute Monday by signing a peace treaty that settles ownership of
a slice of Amazon jungle the neighboring countries fought two wars
to control.
	   The presidents and foreign ministers of both countries signed
the accord at a ceremony in Brazil's capital, where most of the
peace talks took place.
	   The United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile brokered the
treaty, which demarcates the border in a 77-kilometer (48-mile)
section of the Andean foothills. Peru and Ecuador both claimed the
area, which was left undefined after a 1941 border war. The two
countries fought over the strip of land in 1981 and 1995.
	   Monday's agreement lays ``the cement of peace,'' said Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori.
	   ``Now we should start to build the building, beautiful and
inhabitable,'' he said at the signing ceremony.
	   In a gesture of reconciliation, Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad
gave Fujimori a canteen used by Ecuadoran soldiers during the 1941
war.
	   ``The Amazon could have been destroyed by a war. Now we preserve
it with a peace accord,'' Mahuad said.
	   Mahuad and Fujimori also signed a separate agreement dealing
with cooperation on security, energy, tourism and trade.
	   President Clinton, who had met with the Ecuadoran and Peruvian
presidents at the White House on Oct. 9, offered his
congratulations.
	   ``This signing marks the end of the longest-running source of
armed international conflict in the Western Hemisphere,'' Clinton
said in a written statement.

Egypt: Netanyahu in danger of violating agreement with
</HEADLINE>
Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
in danger of violating his agreement with the Palestinians if he
goes forward with a promise to build more housing in West Bank
settlements, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
	   Netanyahu told Israel's Army radio Monday that his agreement
with the Palestinians last weekend did not bar construction in
existing settlements.
	   Arab leaders have repeatedly called for a halt to building on
disputed land.
	   If Netanyahu's comments ``expose the intentions of the head of
the Israeli government, this is the beginning of the breach of the
agreement,'' Moussa said.
	   The agreement calls on both sides to avoid taking steps to
change the status of the West Bank, but does not specifically
mention settlements.
	   Netanyahu has said his government will build in settlements to
make room for natural population growth in the enclaves.
	   Arab leaders view any attempt to increase settlement as a move
to strengthen Israel's hold on the land, which was seized in the
1967 Middle East War.

Martin wins, but Chang is ousted

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Todd Martin advanced to the second
round of the Eurocard Open, but two other Americans, Michael Chang
and Jan-Michael Gambill, lost Monday in the dlrs 2.45 million
indoor tournament.
	   Martin ousted Sebastien Lareau, a Canadian ``lucky loser'' who
was a late replacement for Marat Safin, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Safin, a Russian newcomer, pulled out with a stomach ailment.
	   Guillaume Raoux of France defeated Chang 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, and
Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic beat Gambill 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.
	   Chang, a former No. 2 in the world, showed flashes of his
trademark fighting spirit, but it wasn't enough against Raoux, who
had also beaten the American in their last meeting in the second
round of the Australian Open this year.
	   It has been a rocky year for Chang, who has dropped to No. 25 in
the current ATP computer rankings after finishing last year at No.
3.
	   After winning the title in Shanghai at the start of the month,
Chang lost in the opening round in Singapore. It was his second
straight first-round ouster in Stuttgart, which has drawn all
top-ranked men in the world.
	   A former French Open champion, Chang will not finish the year in
the top 10 for the first time since 1991.
	   Chang saved three set points against Raoux, but the Frenchman
then blasted an ace to capture the first set. Raoux won three
straight games for a 5-2 lead in the second, dropped his serve, but
broke Chang's serve at love to win the match.
	   The Stuttgart tournament is one of the last stops on the tour
before next month's World Championship and Pete Sampras is under
pressure to defend his No. 1 ranking.
	   Marcelo Rios, the No. 2 who leads the tour with seven titles
this year, and No. 3 Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open
champion, are his closest rivals, followed by No. 4 and French Open
champion Carlos Moya.
	   But Sampras also faces an unexpected challenge from Andre
Agassi, a former No. 1 who had dropped to No. 140 at this time last
year after losing interest in the game for a while.
	   But Agassi is back with a vengeance, shooting to No. 5 after
winning on Sunday in Ostrava, the Czech Republic, and he still has
a mathematical chance of regaining the No. 1 spot.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row. Like all top-seeded players, Sampras had a
first-round bye.
	   Agassi's opponent in the second round will be Andre Pavel,
another ``lucky loser'' from the qualifications who upset Paul
Haarhuis 7-5, 6-3.
	   A third ``lucky loser'' made it into the main 64-man draw when
David Nainkin took the place of injured Nicolas Escude. Escude's
French teammate, Cedric Pioline, pulled out with a fever and was
replaced by Jonathan Stark.
	   Stark was found in a restaurant, just as he was finishing his
dinner. He then went on to lose 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 to Gianluca Pozzi,
the same player who had also beaten the American in the qualifying.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with U.S. Commerce secretary
comments, edits to conform. Picks up 7th graf pvs, `The dispute... &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is toughening rules
protecting the privacy of personal data of its 370 million
citizens, threatening a trade skirmish with American companies that
buy and sell such information.
	   Electronic trade and U.S. companies marketing personal data
faced new obstacles Monday after EU regulations went into effect to
improve and extend protections of private data in the group's 15
nations.
	   ``There is an enormous amount at stake here,'' U.S. Commerce
Secretary William M. Daley said in Washington. ``In the information
age, data flows from one side of the Atlantic to the other are
essential to trade _ for both the United States and the European
Union.''
	   Personal data information is an increasingly popular commercial
tool in the United States where a hands-off approach offers limited
privacy protection. In Europe, it is a tiny industry, controlled by
stricter rules.
	   The United States and the EU are holding discussions to try to
defuse the issue. And EU officials said Monday that member nations
supported efforts to try to reach a compromise with Washington by
year-end.
	   Daley said he was encouraged that the EU members ``recognize the
importance of avoiding disruption of data flows while we are trying
to solve this problem.''
	   Earlier, an American diplomat in Brussels said that if the
negotiations proved fruitless and the EU rules hurt U.S.
businesses, Washington intended to file a complaint at the World
Trade Organization. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.

Stones wants track to jump to big-time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ High jumper Dwight Stones, elected Monday to the
U.S. Track and Field Hall of Fame, wants to get his sport out of
the doldrums.
	   ``We need to schtick it up a little bit,'' he said. ``If we do,
people will be compelled to watch. We've suffered for decades,
satisfied with presenting our sport the way it has always been
presented. Others push the envelope. We did not.''
	   Stones, an 11-time national champion and world record-holder,
was elected to the hall in Indianapolis with hurdler Greg Foster,
distance runner Francie Larrieu-Smith and discus thrower Jay
Silvester.
	   Stones thinks that except for Olympic years, track and field
operates as if it were an underground activity. Largely ignored are
World Cup, Grand Prix and national meets and even world
championships.
	   ``Track and field athletes work as hard as anyone,'' he said
during a conference call. ``We deserve our place in the top rung.''
	   Silvester, a seven-time world record-holder, contends track and
field's longtime amateur structure is the reason the sport has
lagged.
	   ``If you want to make a sport struggle in the United States,
make it amateur,'' he said. ``For years, the administration of
track and field followed international rules and was unable to
break out of that mode. I think we are doing better now and
recognize we have to move away from that amateur model.''
	   Stones recalled when he came out of Long Beach State and UCLA to
set his first world record. That was 1973 when American sports was
captivated by Muhammad Ali, the kind of magnetic personality track
and field lacked.
	   ``At 19, I decided to be that person,'' Stones said. ``I was a
world record-holder. I was going to do something to bring attention
to the sport. If Ali could get away with it, I could. Just deliver
and you could say anything you wanted to.''
	   So Stones sounded off.
	   He was happy to say anything that would shake up an audience,
stir up an opponent and maybe humiliate a rival. It was all done
deliberately.
	   ``People booed me, but that was fine,'' he said. ``They thought
I was trying to create a cult of personality.''
	   What he was trying to create was a personality for his sport.
	   ``It provided me with the competition I needed,'' he said.
``Rivalries are good for sports.''
	   Stones would predict victories, even world records. He would
demand silence while jumping. He was Ali in running shorts.
	   ``All you have to do is deliver,'' Stones said.
	   He set his first world record in 1973, clearing 7 feet, 6 1/2
inches (2.25 meters). He pushed the record to 7-7 (2.27 meters) in
1976 and then 7-7 1/4 (2.28 meters) two months later. Those heights
seem ordinary compared to Javier Sotomayor's current record of 8-0
1/2 (2.4 meters) but they were benchmarks at the time.
	   More important, Stones reached those plateaus with style,
becoming the first flop jumper to set a world record in the
bargain.
	   ``It's no different than being on a television show,'' he said.
``We're performers. It's good for the sport.''
	   Foster, the 110-meter hurdles gold medalist in the first three
world championships, won a silver medal at the 1984 Olympics and
set world indoor records in 1986 and 1987. He also won 10 national
titles, indoors and outdoors.
	   Larrieu-Smith set 35 American records at distances from 1,000
meters to two miles, and won 21 national titles from 1969-1992.
Silvester was a member of four Olympic teams, winning a silver
medal in 1972 and a bronze in 1976. He won five national titles.

Piazza signs seven-year pact with Mets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Piazza is staying put, and it took the
richest deal in U.S. Major League Baseball history to keep him with
the New York Mets.
	   The All-Star catcher agreed to a dlrs 91 million, seven-year
contract, which was announced Monday at Shea Stadium. Piazza's
deal, which averages dlrs 13 million a season, tops the dlrs 75
million, six-year contract pitcher Pedro Martinez agreed to with
Boston last December.
	   Piazza, 30, could have become a free agent but opted instead to
stay with the Mets, who competed for the National League wild-card
berth until the final weekend of the season.
	   ``The Mets showed incredible commitment to me,'' Piazza said.
``If I'm so fortunate as to go into the Hall of Fame someday it
definitely will be in a Mets uniform.''
	   He hit .329 this year with 32 home runs and 111 RBIs, getting
dlrs 8 million in the final season of a dlrs 15 million, two-year
deal. After the Dodgers failed to sign him to a multiyear deal last
spring, he was traded from Los Angeles to Florida in May. The
Marlins traded him to the Mets a week later.
	   ``I definitely had some growing pains coming here,'' Piazza
said. ``Once I went through the ups and downs of New York I
definitely wanted to finish my career here.''
	   Piazza gets a dlrs 7.5 million signing bonus, dlrs 4 million
payable on Feb. 1 and the rest on Dec. 15, 2002. The Mets will pay
him salaries of dlrs 6 million in 1999, dlrs 11 million in 2000,
dlrs 12.5 million in 2001, dlrs 9.5 million in 2002, dlrs 14.5
million in 2003 and dlrs 15 million in both 2004 and 2005.
	   In addition, the Mets agreed to give him a suite on all road
trips and use of a luxury box for all games at Shea Stadium. If the
Mets move to a new ballpark during the term of the contract, he
would get a luxury box for 40 regular-season home games and all
postseason home games.
	   The deal is a clear signal the Mets will attempt to trade
catcher Todd Hundley, who is to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next
season and dlrs 6 million in 2000 as part of a dlrs 21 million,
four-year contract.
	   New York also is close to signing pitcher Al Leiter to a
four-year contract worth dlrs 32 million. Leiter, traded from
Florida to the Mets before the start of the 1998 season, went 17-6
with a 2.47 ERA and has said he wants to stay with the Mets.

AEK draws 1-1 against Proodeftiki, but retains lead

 &UR; Eds: repeating for all needing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ After a two-week interruption due to
municipal elections, the Greek soccer championship resumed Sunday
with league leader AEK Athens playing to a 1-1 draw against
Proodeftiki Korydalos away.
	   But despite the level score, AEK retained its lead in the first
division league.
	   The Athens club has 17 points from seven games. Olympiakos
Piraeus, which beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1 away, follows in second
place with 16 points also from seven games.
	   But AEK's lead is threatened by crosstown Panathinaikos which
has 15 points and one game in hand. Panathinaikos plays Monday
against Kavala at the Athens Olympic stadium.
	   AEK took an early lead with a goal by its star striker Demis
Nikolaidis off a corner kick taken by Tony Sawevski in the 2nd
minute.
	   Two minutes later, the visitors came close to a second goal when
Sawevski's shot hit goalie Vangelis Karassavas' crossbar.
	   A similar opportunity was lost by Ethnikos Asteras when
Ukrainian star Oleg Protassov's shot struck AEK's crossbar in the
22nd.
	   The hosts leveled with an own goal by Vassilis Zikos in the
24th.
	   Proodeftiki was reduced to 10 men in the 58th when Vangelis
Dangas was expelled with two yellow cards. But despite the one-man
advantage, AEK's players could not score.
	   Christos Maladenis netted in the 70th, but the goal was
disqualified because of an offside call.
	   Proodeftiki played with nine players in the last eight minutes
when Michalis Politis saw the second yellow card in the 82nd.
Sawevski suffered a similar fate and was sent off in the 86th.
	   Stelios Yiannacopoulos scored two goals and gained a penalty as
Olympiakos beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1.
	   Playing at Kessariani stadium, newcomer Ethnikos Asteras' home
ground, Olympiakos went on the attack from the opening minutes. But
it was Ethnikos Asteras which took the lead with a header by
Vassilis Xanthis off a center from Gradimir Yovanovic in the 11th.
	   Yiannacopoulos levelled in the 26th and Grigoris Georgatos made
it 2-1 with a penalty kick in the 38th. The penalty was awarded
when Filippos Frontzos downed Yiannacopoulos in the area.
	   Yiannacopoulos closed the scoring with a header off a corner
kick by Andreas Niniadis in the 58th.

A call to arms for Cunningham, Flutie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If Dennis Green and Wade Phillips are to be
believed, in the next few weeks they'll bench Randall Cunningham
and Doug Flutie, combined record 8-0, in favor of Brad and Rob
Johnson.
	   Brad and Rob aren't related, but they have at least one thing in
common: They're likely to be booed the minute they step back on the
field.
	   No matter that Cunningham has become twice the quarterback as a
pocket passer than he was in his salad days in Philadelphia. No
matter that Flutie sells tickets and cereal, has won three straight
and added off-beat magic to a traditional game.
	   The standard line from any coach about replacements is this:
``No starter loses his job to injury.''
	   The small print, in these days of the salary cap, reads:
``Especially if he's just signed a dlrs 25 million contract (Rob)
or a dlrs 15 million deal (Brad).''
	   It was all out there for everyone to see on Sunday.
	   Cunningham was 17 of 30 for 190 yards with two touchdowns as
Minnesota kept pace with Denver at 7-0 by beating Detroit 31-13.
OK, so he threw his first two interceptions of the season, but both
were in garbage time and he now has 14 TDs to two interceptions for
the season.
	   So Green is playing coy, with the help of Brad Johnson, who
broke his ankle in the second week against the Rams.
	   ``I'm ready to play,'' Johnson said after working out in Detroit
before Sunday's game. ``But I know Denny has a tough decision.''
	   Green has the luxury. If doctors say Johnson is 90 percent ready
_ or 95 percent or 98 percent ready _ the coach can reply, ``I
won't play him until he's 100 percent.''
	   Give the nature of broken bones, he might not be 100 percent
until next season.
	   Or until Cunningham falters, whichever comes first.
	   Flutie is a different story.
	   The Bills have won four in a row after starting 0-3 under Rob
Johnson, for whom they surrendered last April's top draft pick and
then signed to a dlrs 25 million, five-year deal.
	   Despite starting only one previous game in his three-year pro
career, Johnson was decent, even though the Bills were just 1-3 in
his tenure. There are few doubts he'll be a first-rate National
Football League quarterback someday. He was the QB when Buffalo
handed San Francisco its only loss Oct. 4.
	   But Flutie has been more than decent since taking over when
Johnson injured his ribs on the first series in Indianapolis. He's
been a winner and the showman he always was.
	   He beat the Colts, engineered the last-minute drive that handed
Jacksonville it's first loss, then was 18 of 22 for an NFL career
high of 282 yards in the 30-14 win Sunday night in Carolina. In the
Jacksonville game, he scored the winning touchdown on a busted play
on fourth down.
	   So the Bills are back in contention in the AFC East, tied for
second at 4-3 with the Jets and Patriots, a game behind Miami.
	   But it's more than that.
	   At 36, after eight years in exile in Canada, Flutie still
displays the magic he first demonstrated nearly two decades ago at
Boston College. On Sunday, he completed a shovel pass on a rollout
and a perfect 82-yard bomb to Eric Moulds.
	   That puts people in seats. Bills ticket sales are up since he
took over. He has a breakfast food (``Flutie Flakes'') named after
him. He has fans in New York's northern tier and southern Canada
excited again after disappearing about the same time Jim Kelly
started going downhill.
	   Flutie has been sacked only once in every 30 pass attempts, the
best ratio in the NFL; Rob Johnson has been sacked once in every
five, the worst.
	   Flutie, who signed for about the minimum of dlrs 275,000 just to
get back in the NFL, says the right thing _ that it's Johnson's
job. His salary and the price the Bills paid Jacksonville to get
him says it is.
	   But Phillips could still invoke that 100 percent healthy rule.
Or he can hope Flutie throws a clinker soon.
	   The first would be better for all concerned.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ALIVE AND KICKING: &LR;  Jason Elam's 63-yard field goal for Denver
on Sunday not only tied Tom Dempsey's record for the longest in NFL
history, it also set a record of its own: It was the first to be
kicked by a player from his own territory since the goal posts were
moved from the goal line to the rear of the end zone in 1974.
	   Elam's kick came from his 47. The only other 60-yarders, by
Steve Cox and Morten Andersen, were exactly 60 yards, so they were
kicked from the 50.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; A LEAF TURNS: &LR;  Ryan Leaf threw his first touchdown pass since
the opening week Sunday and didn't throw an interception, a nice
change for a rookie who entered the game with a quarterback rating
of 33.3, 20 points lower than the NFL's second-worst quarterback.
	   He finished 25 of 52 for 281 yards in a 27-20 loss to Seattle,
the first time the Chargers have scored more than one TD in a game
this season. And he had three shots at the end zone from inside the
10 in the final seconds, but couldn't get the tying score.
	   ``He grew up a lot,'' said June Jones, who took over as head
coach from Kevin Gilbride two weeks ago.
	   Maybe Jones had something to do with that.

Talks resume as lockout nears four months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with sides resuming talks; UPDATES with report of new
proposals &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This is probably the week when it becomes clear
if compromise or confrontation prevails in the National Basketball
Association lockout.
	   Commissioner David Stern, union director Billy Hunter and
representatives from both sides were to meet Monday in New York to
resume labor talks.
	   The sides met for 3 1/2 hours Saturday to conclude a contentious
week that included arbitrator John Feerick's decision and the
union's militant meeting in Las Vegas.
	   Now it may be time for both sides to move toward the middle.
	   ESPN reported the owners made several new proposals to the
players Sunday night, but NBA spokesman Chris Brienza called the
report inaccurate.
	   On Wednesday, the league's Board of Governors is expected to
meet with dozens, if not hundreds, of players. Plans for such an
assembly are not yet complete, but both sides are talking as if
they expect such a meeting to take place.
	   That could be Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward
settlement of a dispute that has lasted nearly four months and
forced the league to cancel games for the first time in its
history.
	   The owners are seeking an absolute limit on player salaries, or
a hard cap, to replace the soft cap that was exceeded last season
by more than two-thirds of the teams. By the 2000-01 season the
league wants to have the percentage of designated revenues devoted
to salaries reduced from 57 percent to 52 percent.
	   Players, however, voted unanimously last week to never accept a
hard salary cap such as the one the owners now have on the table.
	   The next meeting between the sides will be just the seventh time
the parties have met since the lockout was imposed by the owners
July 1.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and perhaps some December games _ will be canceled this week.
	   By the time the week ends, fans should have a better idea of
whether the sides have closed the gap. If they haven't, it
increases the chances that the entire 1998-99 season will be
scrapped _ a possibility Stern hasn't ruled out.
	   At their Las Vegas meeting, the players heard baseball union
chief Donald Fehr tell them to stick together no matter what
tactics the owners employ, and football union director Gene Upshaw
urged them to file for decertification.
	   Some proponents of decertification have said NBA owners may
elect to declare an impasse, lift the lockout and impose new work
rules, thereby forcing the players to go on strike. Owners could
make such a move and not be liable for antitrust damages unless the
union had decertified.
	   The owners' labor committee, which is to meet Tuesday, is
composed of David Checketts (Knicks), Mickey Arison (Heat), Gordon
Gund (Cavaliers), Les Alexander (Rockets), Jerry Colangelo (Suns),
Peter Holt (Spurs), Larry Miller (Jazz), Jerry Buss (Lakers) and
Abe Pollin (Wizards).

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two independent Serbian dailies
halted publishing Monday after police raided the office of another
non-government newspaper to collect a fine for alleged anti-state
activity.
	   Nasa Borba and Danas, both briefly banned by the government
earlier this month, said they would not publish to protest a new
media law they say imposes censorship on the fledgling independent
media.
	   Also Monday, editors of Serbia's independent media announced a
campaign to fight the latest media restrictions imposed by
authorities loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The new law, passed last week, bans foreign media from
broadcasting Serbian-language programs and empowers the authorities
to punish publishers and journalists with hefty fines for any
articles or photos deemed damaging to the state.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship, formally abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s, and
threatens to drag the country back to single-party dictatorship.
	   A Belgrade court ruled Friday that Slavko Curuvija, editor of
the daily Dnevni Telegraf, the newspaper's publisher and two other
managers violated the law by publishing an article that accused
Milosevic of introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country
into political and economic chaos.
	   The court imposed fines totaling dlrs 246,000 on the publisher,
Curuvija and the two others.
	   Late Sunday, police raided the newspaper's office, hauling away
equipment to collect the fine. Dozens of desks, telephones and
other equipment were loaded onto trucks and taken away. The police
swoop also prevented the printing of 100,000 copies of Dnevni
Telegraf's Monday issue.
	   Last week's law was passed amid growing anti-Western sentiment
in Yugoslavia, fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end
the crisis in the Serb province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops.
	   The opposition Democratic Party compared the law and other
repressive measures to the former fascist and Communist regimes,
saying ``it is obvious a new period is starting in Serbia in which
the regime will try to spread fear.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In convoys of rumbling tanks and

Tyson trial on schedule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ZUCKERBROD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Mike Tyson's criminal record played a major
role in a prosecutor's decision to proceed with charges against
him.
	   The former heavyweight champion faces a Dec. 1 trial on
misdemeanor assault charges following an Aug. 31 traffic accident
in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland Tyson has denied
the charges.
	   ``His record had a lot to do with it,'' State's Attorney Robert
Dean said Monday of his decision to try Tyson as scheduled.
	   A week and a half ago, Tyson and his attorneys met with Dean and
asked him to postpone the trial for a year and eventually drop the
charges against Tyson if he stayed out of trouble.
	   Initially, Dean said he would consider asking the judge to
postpone the case by putting it on the District Court's inactive
docket.
	   Legal experts say such handling of misdemeanor assault cases is
common except when the accused has a criminal record. Tyson is on
probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.
	   Dean acknowledged that an assault conviction could send Tyson
back to jail for violating the terms of his probation. But he said
that after careful consideration, he decided ``there's no reason
not to try it.''
	   Key evidence in the case includes testimony from the two men
Tyson is accused of assaulting, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard
Hardick, along with other witnesses, said Dean. Tyson is accused of
punching Saucedo in the face and kicking Hardick in the groin.
	   Tyson spokesman Peter Seligman declined a request for an
interview on Monday. His attorney, Paul Kemp, could not be reached.
	   Kemp has said that an out-of-court settlement to head off a
civil suit against the boxer is likely.
	   Saucedo and Hardick supported the return of Tyson's boxing
license by the Nevada Athletic Commission last week.
	   It was revoked after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears a year and
a half ago during a title fight. The panel voted 4-1 to restore
Tyson's license.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip shares edged lower, but most stocks
rose Monday in a session interrupted by computer malfunctions on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
20.08 points _ or by 0.2 percent _ to 8,432.21 despite overcoming a
44-point loss and gaining as much as 68. The barometer of 30 big
companies fell 80 points on Friday to snap a seven-session winning
streak. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Even if Russia figures out how to pay off this
year's foreign debt, it won't be able to repay what it owes in 1999
unless it first receives international aid, a senior official said
Monday. Russia's government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign
debt next year but won't have the hard currency needed to pay it,
said Alexander Zhukov, head of parliament's budget committee. The
announcement came as more bad news for Russia, which is already
desperate to restructure the debt it owes this year. It froze
payments on its foreign loans in August, postponing them for three
months. Talks in London with foreign banks broke down last week,
but Zhukov insisted Russia would find a way to pay off this year's
debts. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is toughening rules
protecting the privacy of personal data of its 370 million
citizens, threatening a trade skirmish with American companies that
buy and sell such information. Electronic trade and U.S. companies
marketing personal data faced new obstacles Monday after EU
regulations went into effect to improve and extend protections of
private data in the group's 15 nations. Personal data information
is an increasingly popular commercial tool in the United States
where a hands-off approach offers limited privacy protection. In
Europe, it is a tiny industry, controlled by stricter rules. ``The
U.S. approach does not mesh with the EU law,'' said a U.S.
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. (EU-DATA PRIVACY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Jubilant about the success of its
stock swap, Daimler-Benz turned Monday toward preparing for what it
calls ``Day 1'' _ the transformation next month into
DaimlerChrysler, the world's biggest auto merger. Daimler cleared
the last significant hurdle toward setting up the company when it
announced its shareholders had swapped about 97 percent of shares
for stock in the new company. The launch of DaimlerChrysler on the
stock market _ or ``Day 1'' _ will now most likely be in the week
starting Nov. 15, depending on how quickly Daimler dispenses with
some legal details. (GERMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT and T Corp., the largest telecommunications
company in the United States, reported a 68 percent rise in
third-quarter profits Monday, easily beating Wall Street
expectations amid cost-cutting and stronger revenue from wireless
and business services. The increased sales offset a further drop in
the company's core long-distance business, with revenues from
consumer service falling 3 percent in the quarter. AT and T said it
earned dlrs 1.96 billion, or dlrs 1.09 a share on a diluted basis,
in the three months ended Sept. 30. That was up from a profit of
dlrs 1.16 billion, or 65 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago
results. (US-EARNS-AT AND T)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers continued strike action in several
cities on Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation across France. The latest walkouts affected transit
lines in Paris, Marseille, Lille, Caen and Chambery, officials
said. The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to
the west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after
a train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense
on Sunday. A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a
fire extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the
driver to be hospitalized. On Monday, A trains were running every
30-45 minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
(FRANCE-STRIKES)
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen announced Monday its
profits rose 77 percent in the first nine months of the year to
1.51 billion marks (dlrs 920.7 million). The three-quarter result
was up from 852 million marks (dlrs 519.5 million) the same period
last year, a company statement said. The automaker attributed the
increase to stronger domestic demand within Europe. While worldwide
unit sales for Volkswagen rose 10.9 percent to 3.53 million cars in
the first nine months compared to the same period last year, unit
sales were down at VW's Brazil and Asia-Pacific units. (GERMANY-VW

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In convoys of rumbling tanks and
trucks, Yugoslav troops and Serb police on Monday vacated some
heavily fortified positions in Kosovo on the eve of a NATO deadline
to comply with a peace agreement or face punitive air strikes. The
withdrawal was President Slobodan Milosevic's final hour attempt to
convince NATO he was fulfilling the agreement he reached two weeks
ago with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on ending the eight-month
Kosovo conflict. A top international observer in Kosovo called the
withdrawals encouraging but said more needed to be done. ``They
need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the agreement,''
said Shaun Byrnes, head of the American section of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, on Monday night. ``They're going down
to the wire.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The killing of a Jewish settler and the
mysterious murder of a Palestinian man in a possible act of
vengeance came in the face of a new Mideast peace deal aimed at
providing more security and halting terror attacks. Daniel Vargas,
a 29-year-old father and husband was shot three times and dumped on
a West Bank roadside, apparently by Islamic militants who then fled
to Palestinian-controlled territory. He was to be buried in
Jerusalem Tuesday. His death touched off angry protests by Israel's
right-wing who called for Netanyahu's resignation and said the
violence was a harbinger of things to come in the wake of the
agreement, which the premier is trying to sell to hardliners in his
own government. Netanyahu easily beat a no-confidence motion
Monday, but mostly due to the backing he received from the dovish
Labor party which he unseated in the 1996 elections.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba made an
impassioned plea for peace in the embattled Congo on Monday as he
opened a meeting of African defense and foreign ministers aimed at
ending the war. ``You stand at the cutting edge, a defining moment
... to determine whether Africa has got the political will and
determination to end the war in the Congo,'' Chiluba said. The
talks went into recess late Monday and officials said they would
resume and would likely continue through the night or reconvene
Tuesday. The goal was to wrap up an agreement for an immediate
ceasefire in the Congo conflict, officials said. ``All of us are
looking forward to this meeting agreeing on a cease-fire.
Indications are that we are ready to sit up late into the night and
if need be up to tomorrow to get this thing done,'' said a South
African official who asked not to be identified. (ZAMBIA-CONGO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who has been reduced to a part-time
president in recent months, was ailing again Monday and canceled
yet another foreign trip, this time to recuperate from high-blood
pressure and extreme fatigue. Yeltsin's fragile health is a source
of daily speculation, and a growing chorus of critics questions his
fitness to guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era. The president's doctors ordered Yeltsin not to
make a one-day trip to Austria on Tuesday because he was suffering
from an ``asthenic condition,'' that makes him very weak, both
physically and emotionally, the president's office said. Asthenia
refers to a lack of bodily strength. Yeltsin's blood pressure was
also unstable, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, adding
that doctors recommended a vacation for the president. ``I think
everything will be fine with'' Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov told Associated Press Television on Monday.
(RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Urging the High Court to order Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's immediate release, his lawyers said Monday that
extraditing the former Chilean dictator to Spain to face charges of
murder, torture and kidnapping would be like sending Queen
Elizabeth II to be tried in Argentina for soldiers' deaths in the
1982 Falkland Islands war. However, a Spanish magistrate has issued
a new extradition warrant to cover an unspecified number of
murders, tortures and kidnappings up to 1992, two years after
Pinochet's 17-year rule ended, the court heard. Lawyers opposing
his release gave no detailed explanation for the new warrant, but
said evidence was building up all the time against Pinochet, who
remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March.
British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 in his bed in a London
hospital on a Spanish warrant citing 94 victims, including
Spaniards, and lawyers said later it could be broadened to include
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared after he seized
power. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)

	   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) _ Riches and fame aren't all they're cracked
up to be.
	   Maria Rosa Da Silva, 11, has turned down a luxury lifestyle at
the American home of actor Anthony Quinn, prefering to help her
mother sell shrimps in southern Brazil.
	   Quinn met Silva while filming the movie ``Oriundi'' near
Curitiba, 500 miles (800 kms) southwest of Rio, in July. He invited
her to live with his family and pay for her education because he
felt he had known her in another life, said TV Globo.
	   Silva arrived last week at Quinn's family home in Bristol, Rhode
Island, but on Monday she was already back in Brazil.
	   ``It's not worth living where people are rich and famous if
you're not happy,'' she said in a televised interview, adding that
she had missed her family and friends.
	   Silva said Quinn was ``a very good friend''. The veteran actor
was ``sad'' that she had left, reported TV Globo.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Woody Allen lashed out at ex-girlfriend Mia
Farrow in a magazine interview, saying she keeps her many children
holed up in ``a cultish compound'' in Connecticut.
	   ``I would challenge Mia's view of herself as a supermother,'' he
told Marie Claire in the magazine's latest issue. ``She
compulsively goes through these manic adoptions even though she
doesn't know where her next job is coming from.''
	   Allen and Ms. Farrow had a child in addition to 10 other
children she has adopted over the years. They broke up in 1992,
when Ms. Farrow discovered Allen was having an affair with one of
her adopted daughters, Soon-Yi Previn. The two have since married.
	   ``Woody is absolutely nuts,'' Farrow's former press agent, John
Springer, told the New York Post on Monday. ``He is a miserable
(person), and he's just trying to get even.''
	   Allen said Ms. Farrow isolates the children in ``a cultish
compound in Connecticut where going out has always been discouraged
... There are many horrible things I could say if I wanted to go
into detail, but I don't.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had
a hug for former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as they marked
10 years since the start of open immigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel.
	   Shamir praised Gorbachev at a dinner Sunday as ``a man of deep
understanding and compassion.''
	   Israeli leaders had long appealed to Soviet officials ``almost
in Biblical terms to `Let my people go,''' Shamir said. ``He heard.
And more, he listened. He recognized the implications and he
acted.''
	   Gorbachev received the Gates of Freedom Award from State of
Israel Bonds. He initiated 1988 reforms that lifted restrictions on
Jewish emigration from the former Soviet Union. Since 1990, more
than 750,000 Jews have arrived in Israel.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Women, don't be shy about checking for breast
cancer, Paul McCartney said Monday.
	   ``Unfortunately in Linda's case, we really got to it too late,''
he told ITN television. His wife died in April from breast cancer.
	   ``Although we had 2 1/2 years of treatment it really turned out
to be nothing much we could have done about it,'' McCartney said.
``So if there's any chance that you might have it, get checks,
that's the main thing.''
	   The interview coincided with the release of Wide Prairie, an
album of solo songs recorded by Mrs. McCartney over 25 years.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The bitter battle over the dlrs 600
million Onassis fortune raged Monday with a slander lawsuit filed
by the father of 13-year-old heiress Athina Roussel.
	   Thierry Roussel sued Stelios Papadimitriou, one of the four
Greek trustees of the Onassis Foundation, which operates the
Onassis shipping enterprises and a large charitable trust.
	   Roussel accuses Papadimitriou of calling him an embezzler. On
Friday, Roussel has to present himself in court after the four
trustees sued him for slander, alleging he accused them of
mismanagement and nepotism.
	   The foundation administers the money until Athina reaches her
18th birthday.

and Konstantin Stanislavsky onto the world stage turned 100 years
old on Monday, and much of Moscow helped it celebrate.
	   The Moscow Art Theater gained widespread acclaim after the
success of one of its first plays, Chekhov's ``The Seagull,'' in
1898, and went on to become one of the century's most influential
theaters.
	   Those attending celebrations at the elegant theater within sight
of the Kremlin included Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, leading
parliament members, Russia's top theater and film directors, and
its most renowned actors.
	   Stanislavsky, a director and actor, founded the theater with
colleague Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and developed the Method
style of acting, which was later adopted by leading directors and
actors in New York and Hollywood.
	   The Method trains actors to forgo mimicry and other stage
conventions relied upon by 19th-century actors, instead encouraging
them to study the inner lives of the characters, as if they were
real people.

 &UR; CARIBBEAN: Hurricane Mitch swirls toward Honduras &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands Monday in the face of the most
powerful hurricane to threaten Central America in a decade.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with
winds of 180 mph (285 kph). At 2100 GMT, Mitch's center was 35
miles (55 kilometers) southeast of Honduras' Swan Island and was
moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
statement from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   The storm was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for
the next five days, the center said.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of alert and
told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer ground
farther inland.
 &UR; DOMINICA: Spate of tiny tremors raises concerns
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Worried that a spate of tiny
earthquakes may herald volcanic activity, officials in the
Caribbean nation of Dominica are developing an emergency management
plan, an official said Monday.
	   Tremors have occurred daily since late September, most of them
too small to be felt. But on Friday there were about 200, including
a cluster that caused small landslides, said Cecil Shillingford,
assistant national disaster coordinator.
	   The tremors' relative shallowness _ one to three miles (two to
five kilometers) below the Earth's surface _ have scientists
concerned that they might signal an eruption of one of Dominica's
dormant volcanoes.
	   Lawmakers were to consider Tuesday a disaster response plan for
an eruption, Shillingford said. Cabinet members ordered the
drafting of the plan during an emergency meeting on Friday.
	   ``We are doing it as a precaution,'' he said. ``We don't know
what this means yet. It has happened in the past and nothing has
happened.''
	   The cluster that hit shortly after 3 a.m. Friday sent boulders
and dirt tumbling onto roads leading to Pointe Michel, Soufriere
and Scott's Head on the southwest coast.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Robbers net dlrs 250,000 in bank heist
	   VEGA ALTA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Three armed men wearing masks
netted about dlrs 250,000 during a bank heist in the northern
Puerto Rican town of Vega Alta on Monday, police said.
	   The robbers burst into a Banco Popular branch at Plaza Caribe
Mall at about 8:15 a.m. They loaded 60 bags of cash from
businesses' weekend deposits into a Ford Escort before fleeing in
the car, police said.
	   Investigators found the car soon afterward, but they would not
reveal its location.
	   Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the police
department's bank robbery division were investigating the heist.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Flash flood sweeps away mother and two children
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A flash flood swept away a mother
and her two children in a stream in eastern Puerto Rico, killing
the mother and at least one child.
	   Police said a wave of water from showers in nearby mountains
crashed through a stream in the Paraiso neighborhood of Ceiba at
about 4:10 p.m. It swept away Maria del Pilar Bon Corujo and her
son, whose name was unknown.
	   Police found their bodies Monday night and were still searching
for the daughter. The children were believed to be two and three
years old.
	   Investigators said they believed the trio was in the river when
the wave swept them away.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Immigration interviews 10 Haitians found adrift
	   CAPE HATTERAS, North Carolina (AP) _ Ten Haitians who drifted in
their disabled boat for days without food and water remained on a
Coast Guard cutter Monday while immigration officials debated what
to do with them.
	   Four other people found on the 29-foot (8.8-meter), disabled
motorboat Saturday were in stable condition at an Elizabeth City
hospital, the Coast Guard said Monday. They were being treated for
dehydration. Another passenger, a woman in her late 30s, died of
dehydration before help came, officials said.
	   A sailboat spotted the boat drifting 115 miles (185 kilometers)
northeast of Cape Hatteras Saturday morning and notified the Coast
Guard. Officials said the craft had been at sea 14 days.
	   ``They were caught in the Gulf Stream,'' Coast Guard Petty
Officer Blair Thomas said. ``It was pretty good they were seen.
They could have gone all the way up the Gulf Stream to where curves
back out into the Atlantic.''
	   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials interviewed the
Haitians on Sunday night and probably will turn over their findings
to the U.S. attorney's office, Amy Otten, spokeswoman for the INS
regional office in Burlington, Vermont, said Monday.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Exile group seeks arrest warrant for Castro
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Cuban American National Foundation, an exile
group, announced Monday it was studying how and where an arrest
warrant could be issued for Cuban President Fidel Castro, who they
contend has detained, murdered and tortured thousands since his
ascent to power in 1959. They want him tried on charges of
genocide.
	   A group of lawyers from the United States, Spain, Colombia and
Venezuela are researching whether legal action can be taken, the
foundation announced during a news conference at its headquarters
in Miami.
	   ``We want ... a judge with courage to order the arrest of Fidel
Castro and any of his helpers,'' said attorney Manny Vazquez.
``Somewhere in the world there has to be some person, some judge
who will order this.''
	   The formation of the legal group was announced just over a week
after the arrest of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in London.
	   The news conference was attended by Estrella Carvajal, whose
mother was imprisoned by the Cuban government for five years.
	   ``I think (Americans) idolize Castro,'' Carvajal said. ``I want
them to know all the brutality he's done.''

Falling prices raise specter of global deflation

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In Brazil, once the problem child of
hyperinflation, prices for food and clothing are sliding. Apartment
owners who refused to lease units during the days of high inflation
are now slashing rents.
	   In Japan, food, beer and household goods cost less than a year
ago. And prices for commercial land are off a staggering 63 percent
from 1992.
	   In China, the government has ordered companies trying to get rid
of excess goods to halt price wars.
	   From Asia to Latin America, consumers once victimized by surging
prices are experiencing a new phenomenon: lower prices on a broad
range of items, from crude oil, gasoline and farm commodities to
computers and new cars.
	   ``For the first time in decades, there is widespread price
deflation going on in much of the world,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
global economist at Primark Decision Economics.
	   Tumbling prices offer relief to consumers weary of paying more
every year for many products. But just like inflation, its flip
side, deflation, or falling prices, can pose risks and
uncertainties for consumers, companies and the global economy.
	   With the Asian financial turmoil pushing many economies into
recession or at the edge of one, analysts worry about the
consequences of a serious bout of deflation, the kind that would
pull prices down not only for food and clothing, but also for
stocks, houses and other assets.
	   In a deflationary spiral, workers' wages would fall, leaving
less money for bills and other payments contracted at higher
prices. Consumers would find their key asset _ their homes _ losing
value. Buyers waiting for prices to fall further would postpone
spending, dampening economic growth.
	   Businesses counting on stronger prices for their products would
earn less than expected. With smaller _ or no _ profits, they would
have difficulty paying wages and keeping current on debts. Bad
debts would mount at banks, which would curtail lending.
	   No one is yet predicting such a destructive cycle in the United
States, but economists are seeing more signs of falling prices and
assessing the risks to the economy.
	   ``The prospect of deflation was laughable a year ago,'' said
Greg Mastel of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. ``Now
it is a real risk (although) a low percentage risk.''
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan even expressed concern
recently about the prospect. ``Deflationary forces are continuing
to emerge,'' he said in congressional testimony.
	   The possibility of widespread price declines causes unease
because the last time there was a sustained period of deflation was
during the 1930s Depression.
	   But economist Kurt Karl of the WEFA Group in Eddystone,
Pennsylvania, said, ``it would take a big recession in the United
States and a collapse in asset prices'' to set off a deflationary
spiral in this country.
	   ``It's hard to see that happening,'' he added.
	   The current round of price weakness in the United States has its
origins in the financial chaos that began more than a year ago in
Southeast Asia. With Asian economies weakening, demand for crude
oil and other commodities skidded, pushing prices lower.
Price-cutting by Asian manufacturers has forced American companies
to lower what they charge for such goods as computers and new cars.
	   American farmers have been especially hard hit by stumbling
prices for beef, pork, corn and other goods, which Asian nations
had in recent years snapped up in large quantities. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman says farmers now are in their worst crisis
in a decade.
	   So far, U.S. consumers have benefited from the price plunges.
	   In the United States, the inflation rate for the first nine
months of the year was a mere 1.4 percent _ better than the 11-year
low of 1.7 percent recorded for all of last year.
	   Deflation has shown up more strongly in wholesale prices, which
are charged by farms, factories and other producers. For the first
nine months of the year, producer prices declined at an 0.8 percent
annual rate, compared with a drop of 1.2 percent for all of 1997.
	   Such a decline is unlikely to show up in consumer prices. A good
chunk of the government's consumer price measure covers services,
such as hair cuts and doctors' fees. Those prices would plummet
only if widespread unemployment led to lower wages.
	   Wholesale prices also have fallen in other Western nations,
including Germany and France.
	   Perhaps nowhere, though, have prices plunged so far so fast as
in Brazil.
	   Not so long ago, the economy of South America's largest nation
was crippled by runaway inflation. In 1994, consumer prices shot up
2,400 percent, and the government imposed a stabilization program.
	   Inflation slowed since then, but now, with the Asian crisis
whipsawing the economy, prices for food and clothing have dropped.
Consumer prices slipped in July, August and September, the first
back-to-back price declines since the government began compiling
the figures in 1979.
	   Rents, too, have dropped _ a marked change from the high
inflation era when some owners locked up their apartments or would
rent only in dollars because of the steady decline in value of the
local currency.
	   Japan, in the grips of its worst recession since World War II,
also is beset by deflation. Consumer prices edged down from June
through August. Stock prices, as measured by the benchmark Nikkei
index, are off about 25 percent from a year ago.
	   Real estate prices are on the skids, the result of the collapse
of a speculative bubble in the early 1990s. The average price of
commercial land in Tokyo last year was off 63 percent from 1992,
according to a parliamentary report.
	   China, too, is in the throes of falling prices. Its benchmark
price measure was off 2.1 percent in the first half of the year.
	   Worried about the problem, a senior government official recently
told companies using price wars to get rid of excess inventory to
halt price-cutting or face punishment. The government has also set
price-control guidelines on building materials, machinery, textiles
and petrochemicals.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has canceled a multimillion
dollar refinery project and may put off building a big
petrochemical plant.
	   Neighboring Kuwait has slashed its budget, frozen government
hiring and announced it would sell more state-owned companies to
raise revenues.
	   In Qatar, the government scrapped plans for its first bond issue
because it would have had to pay unacceptably high interest rates.
	   All this is part of the deepening financial fallout from the
one-two punch of the steep drop in world oil prices and the crisis
in Asia, the Gulf's biggest export market.
	   Even the Middle East's non-oil states are starting to feel the
pinch as hard-pressed Gulf countries send Egyptian, Jordanian and
Palestinian workers home. Foreign investors also are avoiding the
region's tumbling stock markets.
	   ``The focus has been on the economic crisis in Asia and, more
recently, Russia,'' said Kuwaiti economist Jassem al-Saadoun. ``But
the situation in the Gulf is disastrous, and there are serious
implications for the future.''
	   A global recession _ with depressed oil prices and weak export
markets _ could seriously undercut the Gulf countries' ability to
continue providing services and, more importantly, jobs for
populations in which nearly half are under age 16.
	   ``Dissatisfaction could translate into adverse political and
social consequences and create instability'' in a region with some
60 percent of the world's oil reserves, al-Saadoun said.
	   Poorer Arab countries often feel the consequences of economic
belt-tightening fast: More than 50 people were killed and some 200
wounded in riots that followed Yemen's decision in June to reduce
government subsidies for cooking gas, heating fuel and gasoline.
	   Experts disagree on how long and deep the downturn will be, but
few see any relief for oil producers over the next 15 months.
	   Julian Lee, a senior analyst at the London-based Center for
Global Energy Studies, said the 30 percent drop in crude oil prices
this year has cost OPEC exporters an estimated dlrs 48.3 billion in
lost export revenue.
	   ``We don't expect next year, on average, to be any better than
this year,'' Lee added.
	   The reason, he said, is the financial crisis in Asia has reduced
oil demand there and had a ``knock-on'' effect on Western
economies. And Russia, where domestic demand has all but collapsed,
is stepping up crude exports to get desperately needed hard
currency _ and adding to the glut on the market.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is taking the
biggest beating. Analysts estimate its oil income will fall to dlrs
34 billion this year from nearly dlrs 50 billion last year.
	   Oil revenues in neighboring Iran, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates _ all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries _ are expected to be down at least dlrs 4 billion.
	   ``In the past, their investment income was a shock absorber,''
said Mohamed el-Erian, head of emerging markets research for
Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``But stocks and bonds aren't doing
well, so they're being hit on both sides.''
	   Economic weakness is manifesting itself in slumping stock
markets even in non-oil countries, runs on currencies and rising
loan rates.
	   Since the start of the year, the stock market in Oman has fallen
nearly 40 percent. Market indexes are down 22 percent in Egypt, 18
percent in Kuwait and 17 percent in both Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.
	   ``Investors in this part of the world read the same news others
are reading,'' said Henry Azzam, chief economist for the Middle
East Capital Group in Beirut. ``Internationally there's pessimism,
and investors are being very cautious, especially about emerging
markets.''
	   Saudi Arabia faced a run on its currency in late August, and
economists believe its central bank may have spent as much as dlrs
1 billion to hold the riyal steady at 3.34 to the dollar.
	   Lebanon, still recovering from a devastating 15-year civil war,
continues to borrow to restructure its dlrs 14 billion in foreign
debt. But its recent seven-year Eurobond issues carry stiff 8.75
percent rates of interest.
	   Most of the Gulf countries already have cut spending, frozen
hiring, postponed development projects and slowed payments to
contractors _ all moves that will have a depressing effect on their
local economies.
	   At the same time, they're scrambling for new revenue sources,
large and small. Saudi Arabia has raised domestic airfares. Qatar
is speeding up the sale of the state-owned phone company. Kuwait
hopes to open its stock market to foreigners before the end of the
year.
	   Paul Chabrier, Middle East director for the International
Monetary Fund, said the region's countries could benefit if the
short-term pain results in long-term reforms that diversify their
economies and reduce dependence on oil.
	   But Kuwait's al-Saadoun is skeptical. He notes that when oil
prices weakened in 1993 and 1994, Gulf countries ``said they would
postpone this, freeze that, reform this. ... Almost all of them
adopted five-year plans to put everything in order.''
	   Then prices firmed in 1996 and 1997, he said, ``and everything
was forgotten.''

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In the shadow of a busy oil refinery,
Atlantic Richfield Co. and Itochu Corp. of Japan are preparing to
build a dlrs 200 million factory designed to churn out more than
200,000 tons of plastic each year.
	   For American consumers, the joint venture just south of Los
Angeles is important not for the plastic it will produce, but for
Itochu's demonstration of confidence in the U.S. economy.
	   Despite the jittery U.S. stock market, foreign investors fleeing
the global economic crisis still are betting on the United States
as the best place to put their money in troubled times.
	   The trend is likely to continue, even if the U.S. economy
continues to cool, analysts said.
	   ``When you look at what's happening in other parts of the world,
yes, we're still a safe haven,'' said Lee Epstein, market
strategist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a New York consulting and
money-management company.
	   The safe haven status is a good deal for Americans because the
inflow of foreign capital saves them money by helping to finance
the federal debt and bolster bond and stock markets.
	   But as the American economy has slowed, the pattern of money
flowing into the United States has changed. Due to market
fluctuations and uncertainty raised by the Monica Lewinsky
investigation, foreign investors _ like many of their U.S.
counterparts _ are fleeing Wall Street for U.S. Treasury securities
and other investments.
	   ``There's a shift in where they're putting their money,'' said
Jerry Clebanoff, chief investor for City National Investments, a
subsidiary of City National Bank.
	   Because of financial unease in other parts of the world and the
Lewinsky investigation, ``I think it really gravitates people
toward safer investments like short-term securities,'' he said.
	   The amount of money invested from overseas in U.S. stocks fell
from dlrs 30 billion during the first quarter of this year to only
dlrs 14.3 billion in the second quarter. At the same time,
investment in Treasury securities _ long-term bonds and short-term
bills _ rose from dlrs 11.4 billion in the first quarter to dlrs 29
billion in the second, according to Treasury Department figures.
	   But not surprisingly, investment from Asian countries battered
by currency devaluations has slowed.
	   At the end of last year, Japanese investors were the largest
holders of U.S. Treasury securities, with investments valued at
dlrs 277.6 billion. By the end of May, Japan remained the biggest
buyer of Treasury notes, but the numbers fell to dlrs 266.9
billion, according to Treasury Department figures.
	   The decline in Asian investment has been offset with money
coming into the United States from Europe. British investment in
both long- and short-term Treasury securities rose from dlrs 251
billion at the end of 1997 to dlrs 265.7 billion by May 31. German
purchases of Treasury notes went up from dlrs 94 billion to dlrs 96
billion.
	   The decline in Asian investment doesn't suggest a lack of
confidence in the U.S. economy, said Heather Ruth, president of the
Bond Market Association, which tracks investments in government
securities.
	   ``It suggests (investors) need the money'' to offset the effects
of recession at home, she said.
	   Indeed, some Japanese companies such as Itochu are expanding
their American operations or entering into joint ventures even as
their own economy suffers its worst contraction since World War II.
	   NEC Corp. is planning a dlrs 1.5 billion expansion of a factory
in Roseville, California, and Panasonic Disk Services has said it
will spend dlrs 93 million on a new plant in Torrance, California,
according to the California Department of Commerce.
	   ``They consider this a secure place to put their money,'' said
Robert Brasch, an Asian investment consultant who worked on the
Itochu deal.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rebecca Baldridge's dream world disintegrated this
summer, swiftly and stunningly.
	   Gone is the swish three-bedroom apartment along the Moscow
River, weekends in London and dinners at exclusive restaurants
without a glance at the bill.
	   Like thousands of other once highly paid foreigners who came to
cash in on Russia's booming financial markets, her working life
came apart when the Russian economy nose-dived.
	   Fresh from business school at Purdue University, Baldridge had
set her sights on Russia. It was 1995, the country's fledgling
financial markets were soaring, and she easily landed a Moscow
stock brokerage job paying more than dlrs 100,000 a year.
	   ``I thought, well, aren't I just the belle of the ball. I was
amazed at the response,'' said Baldridge, a 31-year-old New Yorker
who despite having studied Russian and holding two master's degrees
had never been to Russia and had little investment experience.
	   Foreigners helped drive the boom in Russia's markets and reaped
some of its biggest, fastest rewards.
	   And they have suffered some of the most severe, sudden losses
since Russia devalued its currency and froze some of its debts in
August. The ensuing meltdown has cost hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of expatriates their jobs, wiped out their personal investments in
Russia and soured many on emerging markets.
	   It was a heady time on Moscow's financial scene when Baldridge
made her debut with Aton, a Russian brokerage. Returns were topping
even optimistic expectations, and in 1997, the Russian equity
market was the world's top performer.
	   Baldridge wasn't entirely happy with her job. ``They didn't know
how to treat Westerners ... We're more uppity.'' She was quickly
snapped up as a senior research analyst by another medium-sized
brokerage, Rinaco.
	   The package there was even sweeter. ``You could make net here
what you would make gross at home.''
	   Moscow quickly responded as Russian and foreign executives began
to get rich. Stores filled up with pricey imports, from dlrs 15
Thai curry paste to dlrs 100,000 Mercedes. Once the nexus of world
communism, the Russian capital was becoming a world financial
center.
	   The rest of Russia, however, saw little investment and growth.
And the country's deeper problems _ a mounting deficit, chronic
corruption and stagnant industrial production _ eventually burst
the Moscow bubble.
	   The financial markets started slumping this summer, and
Baldridge lost her job in July, along with many other expatriates.
Remarkably, she was soon hired by Epic, an Austrian investment
bank.
	   ``I got what I assumed to be the last job in Moscow,'' she said.
	   Then, after months of denying it would do so, the government
devalued the ruble Aug. 17, knocking markets into a dive. Baldridge
was laid off by Epic two weeks after she started.
	   The financial sector wasn't the only one skewered by the crisis.
	   Jane and Lynn Wells left an advertising agency they had started
in Colorado, uprooted their two kids and moved to Moscow this
summer to work as senior managers for DMB-and-B advertising.
	   Both were laid off within weeks.
	   But they haven't given up on Russia and are searching for new
jobs here.
	   ``Being in a market that was very dynamic was why we wanted to
go,'' Jane Wells said. ``It's not all that appealing to go back
into something so safe, secure and predictable.''
	   While Russians were hoarding food in case of worse times,
Baldridge was packing papers into duffel bags on her bedroom floor
in preparation for moving to New York to look for work. ``I don't
really want to go, but there's nothing for a finance person to do
here,'' she said.
	   Like many foreigners in Moscow, Baldridge also had personal
investments in Russia's markets. She said her losses weren't too
large, but some lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
	   Smoothing her hair, she was clearly disappointed. ``I'm going to
see a significant decline in my standard of living. I certainly
won't be as profligate.''
	   And she still needs a job. ``Three years ago my interest in
Russia made me immensely popular,'' she said. Now, ``I'm hoping
Russia hasn't given me professional cooties.''

Chattanooga company makes contaminated soil useable again

	   CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (AP) _ Take 30 tons of gasoline-soaked
soil. Sift in giant rotating cylinder. Bake at 750 degrees (400
degrees C). Cool and package. Spread on softball field. Play ball!
	   This is the recipe followed by Soil Restoration and Recycling, a
Chattanooga company that has been building a reputation for
efficient and environmentally sound ways to recycle contaminated
soil and sludge.
	   The process just described is called low-temperature thermal
desorption. The soil or sludge is ``cooked'' to vaporize
contaminants. What's left can then be used for athletic fields. Or
even gardens.
	   The technology isn't new, but the company, known as SR2, adds a
few environmentally friendly twists.
	   Its high-tech plant is largely fueled by methane gas captured in
underground pipes from garbage fumes at the Chattanooga landfill.
The fumes can generate more power than the plant needs, and the
excess is put on an electrical grid and sold to local utilities.
Rainwater is captured on the 60-acre (25-hectare) site for use in
the treatment process. And SR2 intends to use heat siphoned from
the plant to warm greenhouses on the property.
	   ``It's good for our city,'' Chattanooga City Councilman Dave
Crockett said. ``It creates a local business opportunity and it's
good for the environment. It helps us be a living laboratory based
on principles of sustainable economic development.''
	   The company doesn't just cook soil and sludge. It also can treat
PCBs, coal tar, insecticides, herbicides, oil and other pollutants.
	   John Cipriani, SR2's regional facility manager, said the company
hopes its location _ in a once-heavily polluted city that now bills
itself as a model environmental community _ will help draw
business.
	   SR2 already has set its sights beyond Chattanooga.
	   A Knoxville plant is awaiting regulatory approval, and the
company hopes to sign deals with other communities and build 10
more methane-fueled plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has been helping SR2 link up with communities looking to
control landfill gas fumes.
	   SR2 has international aspirations as well. Its mobile treatment
equipment can be shipped to other states and countries for on-site
projects. The company already has sent seven truckloads of
equipment weighing 100,000 pounds (45,400 kilos) to Mexico to clean
petroleum from soil.
	   Thermal desorption was developed in the late 1980s when the
federal government began requiring large-scale treatment of
contaminated soils and sludges _ specifically targeting leaky
underground gasoline storage tanks.
	   Incineration was expensive and researchers began looking for
cheaper ways to remove pollutants. They found they could ``cook''
rather than incinerate the waste and save on fuel costs.
	   SR2 has restored a Chattanooga property where a company
manufactured carpet and textile dyes for 20 years and killed
parasites and viruses in wastewater-contaminated soil in Dalton,
Georgia.
	   The approach has its limits; the processing can emit dangerous
vapors that must be closely monitored. Rigorous testing is needed
to ensure the soil has been thoroughly cleaned and is safe. And the
technology is not effective enough to process lead and other heavy
metals, along with highly toxic contaminants such as nuclear waste.
	   Despite these drawbacks, the technology is popular and remains
cheaper than incineration.
	   The privately held SR2 would not reveal its profits, but said it
has processed more than 1.5 million tons of contaminated materials
in the last seven years.
	   The company is expanding at a difficult time in the industry.
Stiff competition has cut earnings for many firms and the supply of
contaminated soil is dwindling in the United States, according to
Ramin Abrishamian, a waste-treatment consultant who has overseen
installation of thermal desorption plants at refineries in the
United States and Europe.
	   SR2 business development director Glen Palmer isn't worried.
	   The company has won jobs in Mexico and Canada, and any community
or utility struggling to find ways to dispose of waste is a
potential customer, he said. More work also is available in South
America and Europe, where environmental regulations are now being
implemented, he added.

Eritrean businessmen targeted for deportation from Ethiopia

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ One of the many casualties of a
five-month border conflict in northeastern Africa has been Eritrean
businesses in Ethiopia.
	   The Ethiopian government has deported more than 23,000
Eritreans, including well-known owners of transport companies,
garages, stores, pastry shops, bars and beauty parlors.
	   Those who are expelled are not allowed to take their savings
with them, nor to sell their homes and businesses, the Eritrean
government and deportees say.
	   Abraha Yohanus said he lost a gas station, three tankers, a
house, rental property, two cars and two pickups.
	   The idled Eritreans blame jealousy, revenge and greed. ``They
don't have any business competition now,'' Abraha said.
	   Some have labeled the Ethiopians' actions ``economic
cleansing.''
	   The Ethiopian government has defended the deportations, saying
those expelled were spies and former Eritrean soldiers, or were
raising money for the enemy war effort. The deportees deny the
charges.
	   The government has said deportees are allowed to hand over
businesses to family members or agents before going, but admits
that many are forced to sell at poor prices. The expulsions have
led to a drop in the price of cars because so many Eritreans have
been forced to sell.
	   Eritreans have long been at the core of Ethiopia's business
community, and especially were involved in transportation,
construction, garages and electronics.
	   The 1,500 deportees who have registered with the newly formed
Committee of Eritrean Businessmen Displaced from Ethiopia said they
have lost nearly dlrs 285 million in assets and property.
	   A 34-year-old Eritrean said Ethiopian police whisked him out of
his import-export office in Addis Ababa, sent him on a four-day bus
ride north, then ordered him to walk across the border to Eritrea.
	   The entrepreneur, who refused to be identified because he feared
reprisals on colleagues still in Ethiopia, said he lost a dlrs
240,000 home, a business valued at dlrs 1.6 million and two cars.
	   ``If it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody,'' he
said.
	   Natalie Klein, solicitor of the Supreme Court of South Australia
now studying at Yale Law School, who researched the deportations
from Ethiopia, said the confiscation of property was significant.
	   ``The vast majority of those coming out of Addis have
significant business interests. In a number of instances, it seems
that the police arrived to pick people up and already had
information about the property owned,'' Klein said.
	   ``While those with wealth are being targeted, the net is being
cast quite broadly and so includes people who owned small shops or
lived on private pensions. The war has definitely provided Ethiopia
with a window of opportunity for this property grab,'' she said.
	   Foreign governments, researchers and the U.N. human rights
agency have condemned Ethiopia for violating international
principles by carrying out the deportations.
	   The Ethiopian government has accused Eritrea of meting out
similar treatment to its citizens.
	   Of an estimated 100,000 Ethiopians who were in Eritrea at the
outbreak of hostilities, about 17,000 have voluntarily returned
home, including 7,000 in convoys organized by the government and
monitored by the Red Cross. Investigators have not found fault with
the Eritrean government over those departures.
	   About 550,000 Eritreans were living in Ethiopia, mostly in the
capital and the northern provinces, when hostilities broke out.
	   The two countries had enjoyed a lively trade since Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war.
	   Many Eritreans had set up many businesses in their larger,
southern neighbor, which was less troubled by the war, more
developed and had a bigger population: 58 million compared to
Eritrea's 3.7 million.
	   Eritrean officials have tried to turn the deportees' misfortune
to fortune, helping them to find business, employment and loan
opportunities.
	   One deportee who left behind a large commercial farm in Ethiopia
has already taken over a privatized government farm in Eritrea.
Others have been employed by engineering and communications firms,
as well as the university.
	   ``The deportees are a blessing in disguise for this country,''
said Dr. Girmai Abraham, an economist and adviser to the Bank of
Eritrea. ``In the short run, it can be a burden because the
deported need to be housed, fed _ all the things people need to
live. But in the long run, we are getting some of the most capable
people.''

Killings may hurt chances for approval of new peace deal

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The killing of a Jewish settler and the
mysterious murder of a Palestinian man in a possible act of
vengeance came in the face of a new Mideast peace deal aimed at
providing more security and halting terror attacks.
	   Daniel Vargas, a 29-year-old father and husband was shot three
times and dumped on a West Bank roadside, apparently by Islamic
militants who then fled to Palestinian-controlled territory. He was
to be buried in Jerusalem Tuesday.
	   His death touched off angry protests by Israel's right-wing who
called for Netanyahu's resignation and said the violence was a
harbinger of things to come in the wake of the agreement, which the
premier is trying to sell to hardliners in his own government.
	   Netanyahu easily beat a no-confidence motion Monday, but mostly
due to the backing he received from the dovish Labor party which he
unseated in the 1996 elections.
	   Near the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the West Bank, Israeli
police, acting on an anonymous phone call, discovered the body of a
65-year-old murdered Palestinian man. Police said the caller, who
spoke in Hebrew, said the killing had been to avenge Vargas' death.
Police commissioner Yehuda Vilk said it was not clear whether
Mohammad Zalmouk died after the Hebron murder or whether the two
acts were carried out at about the same time. Police ordered an
autopsy and were investigating.
	   There were no official claims of responsibility in either
attack. Radio reports indicated that police were looking for an
Israeli suspect. Both Israeli and Palestinian officials worked
together on the Hebron murder and Israel media said forces on both
sides were on high alert for any further violence in the wake of
the killings.
	   Israel slapped a curfew on the section of divided Hebron under
its control, barring Palestinians there from leaving their homes,
as it did following the murder of a rabbi by a Palestinian militant
in the city in August.
	   The violence was a first test for the new land-for-peace accord
which promised Israel more security, in exchange for it's
withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of West Bank land it captured
in the 1967 Mideast war from Jordan.
	   Opponents to the deal from within Netanyahu's government number
at least 12 and several powerful coalition partners joined forces
with the opposition Monday in support of early national elections.
	   The Knesset Law Committee voted to hold a first reading on a
bill to disperse parliament and hold new elections within 100 days,
suggesting the date for the elections was March 16, after the
current peace accord is to be implemented.
	   Committee chairman Hanan Porat said the first reading of the
bill could be held within two weeks. A bill needs to be approved in
three readings before it becomes law.
	   The early elections bill will need to be backed by 60 of the 120
legislators in the Knesset where Netanyahu only holds a majority of
one seat. Supporters of the bill said they were confident they
could pass the legislation.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin is skipping yet another foreign trip
because of his fragile health, canceling Tuesday's visit to Austria
on doctors' orders to rest from high blood pressure and extreme
fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday, coming after months as barely a
part-time president, fueled speculation about his ability to govern
the world's largest country and lead it through its worst economic
crisis in the post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is going to Vienna in
Yeltsin's place, spoke to his boss several times Monday and later
insisted he would be fine.
	   Yet Yeltsin's doctors ordered him not to make the one-day trip
to Austria because he was suffering from an ``asthenic condition,''
the president's office said. Asthenia refers to a lack of physical
strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said. There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin.
	   Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev said the 67-year-old president would
likely start a two-week vacation Wednesday somewhere near Moscow.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Sysuyev said Monday on the
Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at a secluded country home.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems,
including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and his
doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of his term, set to
end in the summer of 2000, and they deny he has crippling health
problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Schroeder to take office as German chancellor

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, elected last month on a
platform of change, formally takes office as Germany's new
chancellor Tuesday.
	   Schroeder and his Social Democrats have sealed an alliance with
the environmentalist Greens party to guide Germany through shifts
in economic policy, the government's move to Berlin next year and
the introduction of a common European currency on Jan. 1.
	   With some 4 million Germans out of work, both parties have
declared the fight against unemployment their No. 1 goal.
	   Schroeder has also agreed to work toward shutting down nuclear
power plants and raising energy taxes, though his pledges fall
short of Greens party goals. Other plans include allowing more
foreigners to become Germans, which is seen as a way to promote
integration.
	   Schroeder, 54, will be sworn in Tuesday as postwar Germany's
seventh chancellor after he is formally confirmed by the new
parliament, where his government holds a comfortable 21-seat
majority.
	   By the evening, he will chair its first Cabinet meeting.
	   Schroeder's business-friendly reputation helped him win ``New
Center'' voters who previously mistrusted the left. But since his
triumph in the Sept. 27 election, he has stressed plans to
strengthen the social welfare state.
	   Schroeder takes over from Helmut Kohl, Germany's longest-serving
chancellor this century, whose Christian Democrats suffered a
crushing defeat after 16 years in power.
	   Parliament has been rejuvenated: About a quarter of the 669
lawmakers are new and a record number _ 207 _ are women. Carsten
Schneider, a 22-year-old Social Democrat, is parliament's youngest
member ever.
	   Schroeder represents a new generation of politicians with little
personal memory of World War II that feels at ease moving the seat
of power back to Berlin _ despite the city's burden of association
with Nazi Germany and the Prussian military state.
	   Wolfgang Thierse, the first politician from former communist
East Germany to chair parliament, said at Monday's inaugural
session that the ``Berlin Republic'' stands for a modern, new
country eight years after East Germany merged with the west.
	   ``I view Berlin as an opportunity,'' he declared. ``We can grasp
it by opening ourselves to the pluralistic, diverse culture of this
city.''
	   Thierse also reminded Schroeder of one of his biggest
challenges: making easterners feel fully accepted in Germany and
bringing the region's struggling economy up to western standards.
	   ``This inner-German discourse isn't about to end for a long
time,'' he said. ``West Germans also must accept united Germany and
its changes.''

Serb forces make significant redeployment in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, facing a Tuesday evening deadline, made a significant
last-minute pullback of his and police forces in Kosovo in order to
avert NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Several convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas of this
southern province of Serbia, dominant of the two republics in the
Yugoslav federation, and, according to observers headed for their
barracks or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement (American negotiator) Richard Holbrooke made with
Milosevic,'' Byrnes said in an interview at the end of a strenuous
day of patrolling and observing. ``We will be out looking tomorrow
to see where these people went.''
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what eventually will be
as many as 2,000 ``ground verifiers,'' under the command of the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who
will be checking to see if Milosevic keeps his word.
	   In the Drenica region of central Kosovo, tanks withdrew from
roadside positions where they had dug in Oct. 18. Several police
checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _ scene of the
last fighting. All that remained was a tattered Serbian flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 were driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting between ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb forces.
Most of the Albanians want independence.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halted his crackdown in Kosovo and cut his forces
to levels in place before the conflict began in February.
	   ``I think what we are seeing is a further drawdown of police and
military units in the field,'' said Byrnes.
	   The real test will be if the thousands of displaced people begin
returning to their homes. Refugees in all parts of the country have
said repeatedly that they will go home only with the Serb police
leave their villages. So far, returns have been only a trickle. If
that increases significantly, it will mean a considerable number of
police have indeed pulled out.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there
appeared to be ``a lot of movement,'' but that President Bill
Clinton would wait before judging whether Milosevic had done enough
to satisfy Western demands.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait until shortly
before Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said, NATO was ready to use military force once a deadline
for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The deadline has
already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   After talks with his EU colleagues in Luxembourg, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``I have seen the agreement and
Milosevic has not yet done enough. He has got to try harder.''
	   ``If he keeps to this agreement that is now being proposed that
will certainly be a significant advance - but we want to see the
evidence first.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two-time major winner John Daly
will make up half of the United States team at next month's World
Cup of Golf at Whangaparaoa, an official said Tuesday.
	   New Zealand Professional Golfers Association president Richard
Ellis said the 1991 USPGA and 1995 British Open champion had
confirmed his presence for the Nov. 19-22 two-man teams tournament.
His teammate has yet to be named.
	   Daly was undefeated at the recent Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews but
has been in miserable form on the PGA tour this year. He has
finished no higher than 53rd since the Masters back in April.
	   ``I think it is fantastic that John Daly is coming, he's such a
cult figure,'' Ellis said Tuesday.

Argentina's post-Falklands relationship with Britain consists of
</HEADLINE>
butter, not guns &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ When Carlos Menem meets Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain Tuesday night, they will agree to
disagree on the issue that has bedeviled them for the past 16
years: the Falklands War.
	   But the Argentine president and his colleague appear to agree on
the need to put behind unsolved grievances dating to the war in the
South Atlantic and get on with a prospering trade relationship that
hit a record dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997.
	   The 1982 war dampened a once close relationship between the
countries. Britain helped build 19th-century railroads across the
Argentine pampas and introduced innovations in meatpacking that
helped bring wealth to the land of the gauchos.
	   They even brought in the swank Harrods department store earlier
this century and gave Argentine such popular pastimes as soccer,
rugby and polo. But the 10-week war left long-lasting bitterness.
	   Here, Argentines still call the islands ``Las Malvinas,'' and
Menem's historic visit to London Tuesday is reigniting contentions
over who should control the South Atlantic archipelago. But experts
say Menem and Blair need to avoid the topic.
	   Political analyst Felipe Noguera said both Britain and Argentina
should concentrate on more expedient and profitable issues such as
trade.
	   ``One theory has it that the problem of the Falklands cannot be
solved until it becomes the seventh problem _ after those relating
to trade, oil and other matters. Maybe then we can throw the
islands in as part of a deal,'' he said.
	   Statistics show trade between Britain and Argentina increased by
275 percent between 1991 and 1996, driven by banking, tobacco,
automobile and service industries.
	   England is now the third-largest foreign investor in Argentina,
behind the United States and Spain. In a sign that business is
expected to expand, a contingent of some 70 Argentine businessman
will accompany Menem.
	   Still, the war has a way of resurfacing. In fact, Argentines are
quick to admit that 16 years of hard feelings over the 10-week war
still lurk within the national psyche.
	   ``We are taught from a very young age that these islands belong
to us,'' said Carmen Dardaba, a 62-year-old nurse. ``They're a part
of our history, even if (the British) don't like to admit it.''
	   Signs proclaiming the islands are ``Argentine'' still stand.
Fans even chanted ``the Malvinas are ours'' during Argentina's
nail-biting defeat of Britain in this year's World Cup. Menem
himself has said he would like the islands returned to Argentina by
2000.
	   ``For us, the Malvinas are without a doubt Argentine,'' Menem
declared last week in a published letter.
	   He argued that the sparsely populated islands are Argentina's
``inalienable right'' and urged Argentines not to ``forget our
historical responsibility nor our constitutional mandate'' to
reclaim them.
	   A reluctant Blair has signaled that the issue is not open for
discussion.
	   Instead, the trappings of reconciliation are high on the summit
agenda: In London, Menem is to lay a wreath at Britain's Falkland
Islands war memorial and attend a special service at St. Paul's
Cathedral with war veterans of both nations.
	   But even those plans were met with criticism.
	   Menem had to persuade Hector Beiroa, the president of the
Argentine Federation of War Veterans, to attend St. Paul's. The
widow of an English paratrooper killed at Goose Green, the scene of
a pivotal English victory during the war, declined.
	   However, with Argentines still disputing the islands, Menem will
be forced to bring up the subject of sovereignty at some point in
London.
	   And many remain hopeful he can make progress, like Juan Carlos
Birroco, an engineer from the province of Santa Fe.
	   ``We have to figure out a way to get them back,'' Birroco said.
``And if that means we have to start a dialogue or whatever with
them then let's do it.''

Palestinian covenant issue still smoldering, threatens crisis

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ No sooner than Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators returned home than a new wrangle developed over the PLO
covenant, a three-decade-old document that calls for armed struggle
to destroy the Zionist state.
	   It could be a show stopper, too. So far, the two sides cannot
agree on whether U.S. President Bill Clinton will host a peace
``festival'' in mid-December as Palestinians envision or oversee a
somber parliament session to renounce the PLO's violent past, as
Israel wants.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised his right-wing
constituents that he would get the Palestinians' highest body to
repeal the PLO's founding charter before handing over any land.
	   He contends that the 600-member Palestine National Council will
convene and, for all the world to see, officially cancel the
charter by the legally mandated two-thirds margin.
	   ``Not so,'' say Palestinian officials. Despite Netanyahu's
contention that the job was left undone, they maintain that the
parliament-in-exile already amended the charter by a vote of 504-54
at a meeting in Gaza City on April 24, 1996.
	   What will be held this time is a ``festival,'' said Nabil
Shaath, a member of Arafat's Cabinet and a senior negotiator.
	   ``It will be a popular demonstration to show support for the
peace process,'' Shaath told reporters in Gaza after returning
home.
	   Dignitaries from all governing bodies, including the PNC, will
attend the ceremony at which Clinton and Arafat will speak. Shaath
said the gathered officials will approve a letter from Arafat to
Clinton affirming that the Palestinians no longer advocate
revolutionary violence to take back land that is now part of
Israel.
	   At the heart of the debate is an argument over translation of a
single word.
	   The English text says that Arafat and the parliament speaker
will ``invite'' members of the PNC. The Hebrew version, however,
says to ``convene'' a meeting.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said the English version
of the text was the ``authoritative'' one and that there were no
other official versions.
	   Right-wing opponents of the Wye Summit accord see the murkiness
of the wording as an attempt to beguile.
	   Michael Kleiner, a right-wing member of parliament, said
Netanyahu's claim that the PNC would meet was ``a bluff, a lie, and
sand in the eyes.'' He said the convening of various Palestinian
groups would have no legal standing.
	   Returning from the summit, Netanyahu told a news conference that
there was ``no clouding'' of the issue, adding that ``all of the
PNC will be present or at least invited.''
	   Despite repeated calls, Netanyahu's advisers refused to comment
further on the issue.
	   The PLO covenant was adopted in May 1964 and is crafted in the
rhetoric of the revolutionary slogans then in vogue. Perhaps its
most offensive reference is a definition of Zionism, the founding
ideology of the Jewish state.
	   States Article 22: ``It (Zionism) is racist and fanatic in its
nature, aggressive, expansionist and colonial in its aims, and
fascist in its methods.''
	   Article 9: ``Armed struggle is the only way to liberate
Palestine.''
	   Netanyahu has argued that Arafat's Palestinian Authority has
failed to fully make the transition to peaceful coexistence. His
supporters have combed official media and the speeches of
Palestinian leaders, pointing out praise for terrorists as
``martyrs'' and statements advocating violence.
	   Changing the charter, Netanyahu's aides argue, will send a
message to the Israeli public, which lost faith in the peace
process as the result of bloodshed, that Arafat and his followers
have really turned over a new leaf.
	   Palestinians, however, have been reluctant to be seen as giving
in to Israeli demands. Soon after the 1996 vote to cancel the PLO
charter, Palestinian officials made contradictory comments about
what action the council had taken with some suggesting cancellation
had not taken place. Israel's liberal Labor government which was
then in power _ and the United States _ praised the PNC decision,
however, and accepted the action as complete.
	   The issue is sensitive among Palestinians, in part because
refugees do not want to be seen as giving up claims to land their
families lost inside what is now Israel.

Morgentaler calls on Chretien for security statement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Doctors who perform abortions often fear for
their lives and deserve a statement of support from all levels of
government that would condemn ``terrorist'' acts, says Dr. Henry
Morgentaler.
	   The pioneering abortion provider challenged Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to state that women's rights to abortion are ``being
threatened by a criminal conspiracy and to direct the appropriate
government agencies and police forces to do their utmost to protect
doctors providing these services.''
	   In Ottawa, Justice Minister Anne McLellan said the government is
committed to finding the sniper who killed a Buffalo doctor over
the weekend.

 &UR; Immunization rates must be raised: Experts
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Infectious diseases including polio, diphtheria
and whooping cough are poised to wreak new vengeance in Canada
unless immunization rates rise, medical experts warn.
	   A Health Department survey last year found that more than 20
percent of 7-year-olds did not get their fifth and final booster
shots for diseases such as diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.
	   About 85 percent of Canadian children get all the vaccinations
they need before their second birthday, well below the 95 percent
attained in the Nordic countries, specialists said Monday at a news
conference.
	   The resurgence of infectious disease in some parts of the world,
notably the former Soviet Union, makes it more important than ever
for Canadians to have full protection, they said.
	   ___
 &UR; Colonel cleared of harassment wants accuser investigated
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Military investigators say they could find no
evidence to back 1996 allegations of sexual misconduct against Col.
Serge Labbe, the officer who led the ill-fated mission to Somalia
in 1993.
	   Police also said Monday they found insufficient evidence to
support an allegation of a coverup of the case by Lt.-Gen. Bill
Leach, commander of the army.
	   However, Labbe's lawyer wants the police to investigate the
young captain who made the original allegations. He also wants to
know how the captain's memo got into the hands of the media last
June.
	   Capt. Bruce Poulin, a military public affairs officer, alleged
in a July 1996 memo to Leach that Labbe had behaved improperly
towards female civilian employees at a military base in Kingston,
Ontario.
	   Poulin said Leach, then a major-general, did nothing.
	   ___
 &UR; Pilots needed better information: safety board
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Pilots of a commuter plane that hurtled upside
down into a muddy ditch in June didn't have enough information to
avoid the deadly crash, federal investigators said Monday.
	   The part of the plane where the wheels retract had caught fire,
but the crew never knew it.
	   Warning lights that blink inside the Metroliner II aircraft, and
flight manuals that pilots use to guide their decisions don't point
to the possibility of fire in that section.
	   Eleven people died on the Propair flight carrying General
Electric workers between Montreal and Peterborough, Ontario. The
plane flipped upside down and exploded just off a runway at Mirabel
airport.
	   The crash boils down a problem with the hydraulic system that
lowers and lifts landing gear.
	   ___
 &UR; Arts graduates fare better than commonly believed
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Holders of arts degrees are more likely to have
good jobs and prospects for better pay than most students in other
disciplines, contrary to common wisdom.
	   A study being released by the Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council indicates that students in social sciences and the
humanities _ often the butt of the jokes of fellow students _ may
actually get the last laugh.
	   It suggests those who end their education with a bachelor of
arts degree have a better chance of moving up the ladder and end up
with management positions that eventually yield better pay.
	   The findings contradict the widely held notion than graduating
with no specific skills lessens a person's chance of finding good
employment.
 &UR; In short...
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Car production resumed at a doomed Volvo plant
Monday, ending a six-day protest over severance packages offered by
the carmaker. As workers went back to the business of assembling
Volvo S70s, their union leaders met with company management to
finalize a severance package hammered out Sunday night.
	   IQALUIT, North West Territories (AP) _ A Canadian Coast Guard
ship and two military aircraft scoured the freezing waters off
Baffin Island on Monday for three people reported missing on their
way home from a hunting trip. A father, his 10-year-old son and
another man were last seen Thursday traveling by canoe on
Cumberland Sound, about 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of
Iqaluit, said RCMP. The group was from the community of Pangnirtung
but no names have been released.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands in the face of the most powerful
hurricane in a decade to threaten Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with
winds of 180 mph (285 kph). At 0000 GMT, Mitch's center was over
Honduras' Swan Island and was moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13
kph).
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
statement from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988.
	   Hurricane Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said. The storm was expected to remain in the northwest
Caribbean for the next five days, the center said.
	   The government of Belize closed schools and sent coastal
government workers home early on Monday to prepare for the storm.
Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers on the Caribbean
coast of the Yucatan peninsula.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of alert and
told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer ground
farther inland.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (180 kms) north of
the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they might set up
shelters in public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations to buy gasoline under a steady rain.
	   Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with in case her
firewood gets wet. She bought only 5 lempiras (37 cents) worth,
saying it was all she could afford.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small
islands off the coast of central Honduras.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on one of the islands, said he had
tied up his boats and was planning to take his family to stay with
a relative on higher ground. Speaking by telephone from Utila, 20
miles (35 kms) north of La Ceiba, he said most tourists had left
the island Sunday but that some were stranded and that hotels were
moving them to houses in the mountains.
	   ``Mitch is closing in, and God help us in the coming hours,''
said Utila Mayor Monterrey Cardenas.
	   Police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta
rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along the eastern Honduran
coast. ``Frightened people are moving into the mountains to search
for shelter,'' he said.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (180 kms) north of Tegucigalpa, the
army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident of
the town.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the
Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast Sunday night,
and the hurricane's outer winds were expected to lash the area on
Monday and Tuesday.
	   Forecasters said they don't expect Mitch to be a Category 5
hurricane by the time it makes landfall.
	   ``We do forecast it to decrease in strength over the next 72
hours,'' said Jeremy Pennington a meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center.
	   That didn't stop Flores Facusse from ordering the closure of all
public offices on the Caribbean coast by noon Monday. He also
canceled classes at all schools there, and health officials sent
medicine to public hospitals.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs,'' said
Vice-President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with
Hondurans.''
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at
least 2,000 people.

French lab finds nerve agent on Iraqi missile warhead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to RECAST, ADD context on significance of
findings. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A French laboratory has found decomposed
nerve agent on an Iraqi missile warhead _ contrary to Iraqi claims
_ and chemical weapons experts have reported that it could be VX or
sarin.
	   Discrepancies in results between laboratory tests taken three
months apart and performed in various labs also raise questions
about whether Iraq tried to hide what was inside the warheads.
	   The French findings were conducted on different missile
fragments than those tested by a U.S. Army laboratory in the
spring. The earlier results, released in June, indicated traces of
decayed VX nerve agent, a colorless, odorless liquid, a drop of
which can kill in minutes.
	   Iraq has claimed it never was never able to make enough VX, or
stabilize it properly, to load into missiles.
	   Monday's report didn't say explicitly that VX was found in any
of the new tests, which were conducted in American, French and
Swiss laboratories. But it did say the French laboratory found a
``degradation product of a nerve agent,'' in one of about 40
samples. The agent could come from breaking down VX, sarin or
another nerve agent called soman.
	   French experts said that what was found could have come merely
from a harmless detergent, but U.S. experts said that the
particular chemical found never was made into a detergent that has
been sold commercially.
	   The report on the laboratories' findings, compiled after a
meeting in New York by chemical weapons experts from seven
countries, also raised questions about what happened to missile
fragments after the U.S. tests.
	   The second round of tests found residue of a decayed
decontamination compound that wasn't discovered in the original
U.S. tests, the report said. According to the report, there was
``no obvious explanation'' for why the original U.S. results didn't
find the compound.
	   The samples in the second round would have been in Iraqi
possession after the Army lab's tests.
	   ``It's a clear sign that they tampered with the samples in the
interim,'' said David Kay, a former U.N. weapons inspector who now
consults for Science Applications International Corp., in
Washington.
	   The report doesn't suggest tampering. It says, however, that the
presence of decay from a decontamination compound counters Iraq's
claim that 20 missile warheads tested had only been in contact with
alcohol.
	   The use of such products indicates there may have been something
more potent than alcohol, which wouldn't require a decontamination
compound, inside the warhead that the Iraqis wanted to destroy.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which carries out inspections in
Iraq, and international chemical experts suggested in their report
that Iraq explain what happened to the fragments that were analyzed
and why degradation products of nerve agents were found on some.
	   The commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, leading
to the Persian Gulf War.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify Baghdad had
destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   The VX question is one of several outstanding issues that
inspectors say they must clarify before they can state that Iraq no
longer has or can produce weapons of mass destruction.
	   Butler agreed to conduct a new round of tests in French, Swiss
and U.S. laboratories after Iraq disputed the original Army
findings.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday,
while Tokyo stock prices bounced back on expectations the Japanese
government will increase spending to stimulate the sagging economy.
	   The dollar bought 119.44 yen in early trading, up 0.42 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 119.10 yen
in late overnight trading.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 197.18
points, or 1.42 percent, to 14,040.63 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the average closed down 301.24
points, or 2.13 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar followed through from New York
overnight, where the currency strengthened against the yen and
other major currencies after Italy cut interest rates.
	   The long-awaited move by the Bank of Italy was expected to pave
the way for more rate cuts in Europe. The central bank cut the
official discount rate to a larger-than-expected 4.00 percent from
5.00 percent.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   The dollar was also supported after credit ratings agency
Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing the
creditworthiness of eight Japanese life insurance companies.
	   On the stock market, a major Japanese newspaper said Tuesday
that the government plans to increase spending for economic
stimulus measures in a supplementary budget.
	   The Nihon Keizai business daily said the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party is considering increasing the supplementary
budget, to be drafted later this year, by 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.47
billion)
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.43 points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,055.17
points. The TOPIX closed down 19.41 points, or 1.81 percent, the
day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.880 percent from Monday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 108.17 yen from 108.27 yen.

Serbs: Ethnic Albanians will always be intruders in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NERODIMLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb policeman in a blue
camouflage uniform jerked his head sharply toward the
rebel-infested mountain directly across from his bunker and vented
his hatred for the ethnic Albanians he has been fighting in Kosovo.
	   Like many Serbs, policeman Dragan Mladenovic believes the United
States and its NATO allies are siding with the rebels in the
conflict in the southern Serbian province.
	   ``If the Americans love the Albanians so much, they can take
them,'' he growled.
	   As he spoke Sunday, small arms fire crackled in the
near-distance, two dozen shots giving ample testimony that while
there is a general cease-fire in the conflict that has claimed
hundreds of lives since February, the violence continues.
	   It has not stopped in the stunningly beautiful mountains of
Kosovo, awash in autumn reds, yellows and oranges, and it has not
stopped in the hearts of two peoples trying to build their lives in
Kosovo.
	   ``I worked 20 years in Sweden,'' Mladenovic said as he stood
outside his sandbag bunker camouflaged with branches and leaves,
rifle slung over his shoulder. ``There are Albanians there too.
They have to learn Swedish. If they don't like it, they can leave.
	   ``Here, we're supposed to provide them with their own schools
and universities. If they don't like it, they can go home.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants. They insist they are descendants of the ancient
Illyrians, who were living in the region centuries before the
Slavic Serbs arrived.
	   But in the eyes of most Serbs, that doesn't make them any less
newcomers encroaching on Serb land.
	   ``We're born here,'' said Mladenovic, spitting onto the damp
ground. ``We're natives here. My great-great grandfather was born
here. Now I have to risk my life for something that doesn't even
belong to the Albanians. What will happen? Jobs will be divided.
Ten jobs will go to Albanians. Two will go to Serbs. What are my
kids supposed to do?''
	   Those views point to fear among many Serbs that the
international mediation effort _ spearheaded by the United States _
will end up giving the province to the ethnic Albanians, despite
Washington's opposition to the rebels goal of complete
independence.
	   Serb police bunkers line this heavily wooded hillside. The men
on watch stare directly across a small stream to a gap in the
mountains where a narrow dirt path descends into the small valley.
This is the route the ethnic Albanian fighters, or Kosovo
Liberation Army, use to come down to the village, they say.
	   Armed villagers stand watch on the road where a reporters' car
and that of an accompanying police officer have pulled off to
survey the scene.
	   Miljko Zuvic, a short man with a flowing moustache and a leather
jacket, is head of the armed civilian village force that protects
the farmers working in the fields and the woodsmen chopping trees
in the forest.
	   ``That's KLA territory,'' he says, pointing to the other side of
the valley 200 yards (meters) away.
	   ``Our biggest worry is their opening fire on civilians,'' he
says. ``They shoot at whomever comes down the road. They can't tell
if the people are Serbs or Albanians.''
	   ``We're not fools,'' says Zuvic, playing the tour guide back in
the heart of the village, showing a visitor a black pine tree said
to have been planted by the Emperor Dusan in 1336.
	   ``We're not enjoying war. If they hand over their weapons, we
will turn over ours as well.''
	   The 662-year-old black pine, he says, noting the marble
inscription, is yet another proof that the Serbs have a long claim
to Kosovo.

Sides meet at secret site; progress reported

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association commissioner
who once called himself ``Easy David'' turned into ``Stealth
David,'' holding talks with the players' union at a site that was
kept secret.
	   Monday's meeting, which included about 20 people from the union
and 12 from the league, began at midafternoon and lasted into the
evening. Several sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, told The Associated Press that progress was made,
although they differed on how substantial that progress was.
	   One thing, however, was clear: This was shaping up as a week in
which the sides could choose between confrontation and compromise.
	   ``My reading is that they wouldn't be meeting unless there was
some significant movement on the part of the owners, or at least
the possibility of movement,'' said agent Mark Fleisher, a member
of the union's agents advisory council.
	   The sides met for about three hours Saturday to conclude a
contentious week that included arbitrator John Feerick's decision
on owners' liability for guaranteed contracts and the union's
militant meeting in Las Vegas.
	   Details of Saturday's session were a closely guarded secret. So
secret, in fact, that two sources very close to Stern and Hunter _
one aligned with management, one with the players _ said they were
being kept in the dark, too.
	   ``Billy won't give up the ship, not after what happened with the
players in Las Vegas,'' Fleisher said. ``So the fact that they're
meeting could be a positive sign.''
	   Any compromise would likely include movement from both sides on
the use of a ``luxury tax'' to deter owners from signing their best
players to overly lucrative contracts under the so-called ``Larry
Bird exception.''
	   The union has proposed a 50 percent tax on the amount of any
annual salary exceeding dlrs 18 million, and the owners have
proposed a tax of anywhere from 50 to 200 percent on any Bird
contract of more than dlrs 2.6 million annually.
	   If the sides can come up with a compromise number that would
effectively set a maximum salary, they would seem to be on the way
to coming up with an agreement that leaves more money for the
middle class of players that was shrinking under the old labor
agreement.
	   One possible point of contention could be the owners' insistence
on having a hard salary cap as a fallback in case a tax system
failed to reduce the amount of basketball-related income devoted to
player salaries.
	   In their last proposal, the league asked that the percentage be
reduced from its current 57 percent to 52 percent in the 2000-01
season, 50 percent in 2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The players voted unanimously in Las Vegas never to accept a
hard cap.
	   The union has offered two cap-tightening mechanisms if the
salary percentage reaches 63 percent.
	   Monday's talks _ the seventh joint session _ came in advance of
a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. And they may
be Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward settling a
dispute that has lasted nearly four months and has forced the
league to cancel games for the first time in its history.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and probably some December games _ will be canceled this week. So
far, only the first two weeks of the season have been scrapped.

Serb forces make significant redeployment in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, facing a Tuesday evening deadline, made a significant
last-minute pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo in
order to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Several convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas of this
southern province of Serbia, the dominant of the two republics in
the Yugoslav federation. According to observers, the forces were
headed for their barracks or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement (American negotiator) Richard Holbrooke made with
Milosevic,'' Byrnes said in an interview at the end of a strenuous
day of patrolling and observing. ``We will be out looking tomorrow
to see where these people went.''
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what eventually will be
as many as 2,000 ``ground verifiers,'' under the command of the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who
will be checking to see if Milosevic keeps his word.
	   In the Drenica region of central Kosovo, tanks withdrew from
roadside positions where they had dug in Oct. 18. Several police
checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _ scene of the
last fighting. All that remained was a tattered Serbian flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 were driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting between ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb forces.
Most of the Albanians want independence.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown in Kosovo and cut his forces
to levels in place before the conflict began in February.
	   The real test will be if the thousands of people displaced by
the conflict begin returning to their homes. Refugees in all parts
of the country have said repeatedly that they will go home only
with the Serb police leave their villages. So far, returns have
been only a trickle. If that increases significantly, it will mean
a considerable number of police have indeed pulled out.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there
appeared to be ``a lot of movement,'' but that President Bill
Clinton would wait before judging whether Milosevic had done enough
to satisfy Western demands.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait until shortly
before Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said, NATO was ready to use military force once a deadline
for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The deadline has
already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   After talks with his EU colleagues in Luxembourg, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``I have seen the agreement and
Milosevic has not yet done enough. He has got to try harder.''
	   ``If he keeps to this agreement that is now being proposed that
will certainly be a significant advance _ but we want to see the
evidence first.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.

Report: Fuji Bank to cut 1,200 jobs, halve overseas offices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd. will cut 1,200 jobs over the
next three years and close offices in Japan and overseas as part of
a broad restructuring plan, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The bank, one of Japan's largest, will cut the number of
overseas branches by half, and close about 50 branches at home, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri said. Fuji currently has 355 branches and
14,600 employees. The job cuts will be made by March 2001.
	   A spokesman for the bank refused to comment on the report.
	   The reduction is an increase from an earlier plan to trim 850
jobs and represents an acceleration of a three-year restructuring
plan announced by the bank in March, the newspaper said.
	   The bank plans to increase its capital by 200 billion yen (dlrs
1.7 billion) through contributions from companies within its
corporate group. Fuji is part of the Fuyo group, which also
includes companies such as Yasuda Trust and Banking Co.
	   Fuji also plans to ask for a capital infusion from the
government as part of Japan's plan to recapitalize its banking
system, the paper, Japan's largest, said.

Benaud leads congratulations for Taylor's team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Richie Benaud, the only other
Australian cricket captain to win a series in Pakistan, was among
the first to congratulate Mark Taylor's side for wrapping up a 1-0
triumph in Karachi.
	   ``I thought the senior players _ Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and
Ian Healy in particular _ were outstanding but the entire team made
contributions,'' Benaud said Tuesday. ``It's fantastic.''
	   Benaud's team beat Pakistan 2-0 in the 1959-60 series while
Taylor's team set up its 1-0 win with a victory in the first test
and draws in the second and third.
	   ``It was slightly disappointing they didn't win the last test
for 2-0,'' Benaud said. ``But it was a marvelous effort and the
team deserves every plaudit it's getting, every one.''
	   Bob Simpson led an Australian team to Pakistan as captain in
Pakistan in 1964-65 and coached teams led by Allan Border in
1988-89 and Taylor in 1994. He lost all three times.
	   ``It is without doubt a great achievement, especially to
dominate the whole series and win so comfortably,'' Simpson said
Tuesday. ``The (1994 series) was very frustrating because we
probably played just as well and lost.''
	   Taylor's 1994 team was deprived of victory by a record
last-wicket stand in the third test as the hosts made more than 300
on the final day.
	   His first test in Pakistan resulted in two ducks and the series
loss but he was heralded as Australia's man of the series after the
victory and his Australian record-equaling 334 in the second game.
	   Taylor, who had been expected to retire in March following the
upcoming Ashes tour by England, said the series may have increased
his time in the game.
	   ``This series has been fantastic,'' Taylor told Australian
radio. ``I've been a winning captain, I've been man of the series,
made 500 runs, made a triple century in test cricket. If that keeps
continuing, well I'll keep playing for Australia.''
	   Australian cricket writers said the series win was one of the
most important in the country's history.
	   ``It ranks with victory in the West Indies three years ago as a
defining moment in the modern game,'' wrote Malcolm Conn in The
Australian.
	   Mark Ray, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, said Taylor's
``place in the first rank of Australian captains was confirmed'' by
the victory.
	   ``Pakistan might not be as inhospitable as in the 1980s or
before, or this Pakistani team as strong as some of its
predecessors, but Australia's win is a major achievement ranking
alongside Taylor's win in the Caribbean in 1995 and Allan Border's
Ashes win in 1989,'' Ray wrote.
	   Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph was likewise impressed,
headlining its report ``On top of the world.''

King Hussein, the peacemaker, has political goals, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein drew praise from the Clinton
administration for leaving his sickbed to nudge along Middle East
peace negotiations.
	   But his attendance at crucial moments of the negotiations during
last week's Mideast summit in the United States also was aimed at
politics back home.
	   He wanted to assure an agreement he believes is in Jordan's best
interests, and he was eager to soothe mounting anxieties at home
about his health.
	   ``It brought life back to many people to see him out of bed,''
said Ahmed Masri, a bank clerk in the capital, Amman.
	   It was clear Hussein, 63, was much changed. Chemotherapy at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, had caused his hair to fall
out. And he looked frail in a business suit, a contrast to the
robust leader known for his military bearing.
	   The visit itself came after Israeli media said the king's
non-Hodgkins lymphoma was terminal _ reports that were denied by
Jordan but troubled many at home who have known only Hussein as
their leader for 43 years.
	   The king was feisty, joking about the loss of his hair and
eyebrows. He responded to the reports of his imminent death by
saying: ``Many people in our part of the world, in different parts
of the world, have written me off.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, my morale is the highest it has ever
been,'' he told the White House ceremony on Friday that followed
nine days of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
	   Despite Hussein's key role in the talks, he has not always been
so friendly with Israelis or Palestinians.
	   Jordan fought wars with Israel in 1948 and 1967. Many
Palestinians hated Jordan's annexation of the West Bank in 1950,
and in 1970 Hussein had to put down a revolt by Palestinians trying
to found a state within his state.
	   But Hussein is an enduring figure in the Middle East, surviving
plots and assassination attempts. Now, his renouncing of any claim
to the West Bank in 1988 and his 1994 peace treaty with Israel have
given him influence with both sides.
	   At the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat praised his dedication to
peace.
	   Clinton said of the king's role: ``Every time he was in the
room, he made us all become a little closer to the people we all
would like to see ourselves as being.''
	   As for Hussein's own goals, he wants to ensure that a permanent
peace will lead to Palestinian statehood _ a final rejection of
hard-line Israeli suggestions that his own kingdom should serve as
a homeland for Palestinians.
	   A swift settlement also would ease opposition by his
predominantly Palestinian population to Jordan's own peace treaty
with Israel. Increased trade and investment promised by the pact _
but so far unrealized _ could help win the people's support.
	   ``Jordan's political and economic future and its stability and
security were on the table in the peace negotiations,'' columnist
Fahd Fanek wrote in the mass circulation daily Al-Ra'i. ``Issues
negotiated touch directly on Jordanian interests.''
	   But for many Jordanians, the king's self-assurance _ he even
piloted his own plane to the talks _ meant more than the politics.
It gave weight to doctors' reports he would soon be cured and back
on the job.
	   ``The king proved to his countrymen that he was strong enough to
attend the talks and capable of skillful political maneuvering
despite his ailment,'' said Jamal Shaer, a former Cabinet minister.

Pinochet's lawyers argue in court his arrest was illegal

	   LONDON (AP) _ While lawyers try to keep former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's from being extradited to Spain, Interpol
has received a second extradition warrant _ from Switzerland.
	   Pinochet's attorneys urged a High Court judge Monday to order
British authorities to release their client, saying he cannot be
prosecuted for actions committed while in office.
	   The court hearing was scheduled to resume later on Tuesday, but
a judgment is not expected until an unspecified later date.
	   Pinochet has been held for the past 10 days in a private London
hospital where he was recovering from back surgery when he was
arrested at the request of a Spanish magistrate seeking to charge
him with murder, torture and kidnapping.
	   Lawyers for the Spanish magistrate said a new extradition
warrant had been issued, expanding the initial allegations to cover
an unspecified number of murders, tortures and kidnappings up to
1992, two years after Pinochet's 17-year rule ended. Although he
stepped down in 1990, Pinochet remained commander-in-chief of the
Chilean army until March.
	   The original warrant on which Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16
cited 94 victims, including Spaniards. Lawyers later said it could
be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or
disappeared after he seized power.
	   Late Monday night, the London office of Interpol, the
international police organization, received an extradition warrant
from Switzerland over the 1977 disappearance of Alexis Jaccard, a
student with dual Swiss-Chilean citizenship.
	   The warrant alleges murder, kidnapping and torture, said an
Interpol spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In the hearing Monday, Pinochet's lawyers argued that ex-heads
of state have immunity from prosecution for acts committed in an
``official capacity.''
	   ``The official functions of the president of Chile do not
include the systematic torture and elimination of political
opponents,'' countered Alun Jones, attorney for the prosecution.
	   As Chilean exiles crowded into the spectator's gallery watched,
Jones said Pinochet stands accused of killing 4,000 people, and
that the warrant could be amended further.
	   ``Fresh information is coming all the time,'' he said.
	   The new Spanish warrant, issued late last week, asserted that
Pinochet was responsible for murders between January 1976 and
December 1992, torture between 1988 and 1992 and kidnappings
between 1982 and 1992. Numbers and nationalities of the victims
were not given.
	   Saying that the extradition is invalid because Pinochet is not
Spanish, chief Pinochet lawyer Clive Nicholls said that releasing
the general under diplomatic immunity would not prevent an
international tribunal from pursuing him.
	   Britain says Pinochet does not have immunity and the government
cannot intervene in the legal process.
	   Chilean officials have appealed to Britain to release Pinochet
on humanitarian grounds, saying his health is deteriorating, and a
Chilean military aircraft with medical personnel and equipment is
on standby at a Royal Air Force base outside London to take the
general home if he should win his case.
	   In Chile the ``President Pinochet Foundation,'' established by
former Pinochet civilian and military aides on his 80th birthday,
said it has opened a special bank account to receive contributions
to finance his legal defense.
	   Pinochet seized power in Chile in a violent 1973 coup, ousting
President Salvador Allende, a democratically elected leftist who
died in the uprising.

For young Chilean immigrant, Pinochet arrest raises hope
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Half a world and half a lifetime away
from the Chile where his parents vanished, Luis Emilio Recabarren
cherishes a sweet and macabre dream.
	   ``I have a dream that my parents will someday come and tap me on
the back and say: 'Here we are'.''
	   On Monday, when he spoke, he felt new hope of realizing the
dream.
	   He doesn't expect it to come true literally; he has no doubts
that his parents are dead. But with former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet under arrest in London, Spain seeking his
extradition and criminal complaints filed against him in Sweden,
Recabarren believes the time may be imminent for new facts to come
out about the thousands who disappeared under Pinochet's rule.
	   Even if he just learns where his parents are buried would be, in
essence, like hearing them say ``Here we are.''
	   ``We don't know if they are under the ground, if they are in the
sea,'' he said. ``That's the biggest preoccupation ... We don't
have any grave to put flowers on.''
	   Recabarren's uncle, Javier Munoz, was one of three Chilean
immigrants who on Sunday filed complaints of murder and kidnapping
against Pinochet with Stockholm police.
	   Prosecutors on Monday had not yet been given the complaints by
the police, and it was unclear whether Sweden considers itself to
have jurisdiction in such cases. But Recabarren said he believes
even a longshot effort is worthwhile.
	   ``Evilness can come back if we continue forgetting,'' he said.
	   Recabarren was 2 1-2 years old when his parents disappeared on
April 29, 1976. His labor activist father, also named Luis Emilio,
his pregnant mother Narvia Mena, his uncle Manuel and he were on a
bus in Santiago.
	   When they got off the bus, men emerged from three cars and
seized them, he says. Hours later, he was left alone outside his
grandparents' house and when his grandfather later went out to find
information about what happened, he was seized too, he says.
	   That's all he knows _ if he even knows that much. Recabarren
admits that he's not sure how much of this he remembers himself and
how much has been told to him by others. It's all the more reason
why he wants to know.
	   After his parents vanished, he was raised by his grandmother.
``She gave me a lot of love, so that I would not hate all these
people. She gave me a chance to get a life, to survive this.''
	   After coming to Sweden at age 11, he went from surviving to
quietly thriving and now performs with a dance company in
Stockholm.
	   ``It has been great to live in a democracy,'' he said. It's so
good that ``you almost forget (what it means) that we're living in
a democracy.
	   But Recabarren can't forget what he doesn't know, and so he
wants the facts about his parents, however grisly the truth might
be.
	   ``I want to go forward ... I want to know everything,'' he said.
``I've been dealing with this for so long that I'm prepared _ I
think.''

Hyundai chief crosses into North Korea with 501 cattle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ The founder of South Korea's largest
conglomerate drove 501 more cattle across the world's most heavily
armed border Tuesday in a move government officials hoped would
help thaw relations with North Korea.
	   Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, walked
across the border at the neutral truce village of Panmunjom shortly
after a convoy of 51 trucks carrying the cattle moved into the
northern part of the peninsula.
	   Wearing a hat and a trench coat, the 84-year-old Chung smiled
and waved as he walked into the North, accompanied by four family
members and Hyundai executives. It was Chung's second trip to his
native North Korea in four months.
	   Chung visited the reclusive North in June with an initial 500
cattle. Chung's second gift Tuesday was valued at 2 billion won
(dlrs 1.5 million) and included 20 Hyundai passenger cars.
	   ``This time, Mr. Chung will finalize a tourism project being
pushed by Hyundai, which will certainly have a positive effect on
the overall inter-Korea relations,'' said Lee Ho, the chief analyst
at the government's Unification Ministry.
	   Relations between the rival Koreas are icy because of continuing
military and political tensions. The two Koreas are technically at
war, with no peace treaty signed at the end of 1950-53 Korean War.
	   South Korea's new government led by President Kim Dae-jung is
actively pushing non-governmental exchanges with North Korea under
its ``sunshine policy'' aimed at opening up the North's closed
society.
	   Hyundai officials said Chung expects to meet the North's new
leader, Kim Jong Il, during this week's visit, which has been
extended by one day to four days at the North's request. North
Korean officials had promised in June that Chung would be allowed
to meet the leader during his second visit, they said.
	   The cattle donation is part of Hyundai's effort to do business
in North Korea, including tourism and several industrial projects.
	   Hyundai already has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai officials said the exact date of the first tour will be
decided during Chung's four-day visit. They hope the first ship can
sail in mid-November.
	   The second cattle donation was delayed because of North Korean
accusations that 71 of the 500 cattle donated in June died because
of a South Korean government plot to kill the animals by
force-feeding them indigestible materials.
	   A survey of other Hyundai cattle being raised at the group's
ranch found that some of them also have indigestible hemp rope and
vinyl strips in their stomachs, apparently picked up from the
landfill used to build up the area.
	   North Korea then called the issue a misunderstanding and South
Korea dropped its demand for an apology, clearing the way for
Chung's second visit.
	   Hyundai officials said they have taken precautions to assure
that none of the 501 cattle to be donated Tuesday have such
problems.

Japan's jobless rate hovers at record 4.3 percent in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate stood unchanged at a record
4.3 percent in September as the recession-hit country's work force
shrank for an eighth straight month, the government said Tuesday.
	   The ranks of the unemployed totaled 2.95 million people, with
the number of jobs falling by 700,000 to 65.26 million, the
Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Japan's jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily in recent months.
	   In a sign of continued corporate restructuring, the number of
employees at companies with 500 or more workers in September fell
by 20,000 jobs, or 0.2 percent, compared to a year ago _ the first
drop in 13 months.
	   Even as full-time worker payrolls have been cut at many
companies, the number of temporary employees increased by 200,000
to 4.91 million. That marked the 25th consecutive month of
increase.
	   Also Tuesday, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, sank to 0.49 _ the
lowest level since the government began compiling such figures in
1963.
	   The figure means that only 49 jobs were available for every 100
people seeking employment.

Bestseller in China says corruption is strangling reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BEJ101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHENZHEN, China (AP) _ Gripes about corrupt officials are common
in China. But a daring author has taken the complaints a step
beyond, blaming the political system that allows sleazy bureaucrats
to get rich at the expense of ordinary people.
	   He Qinglian's book punctures government propaganda built up
during China's celebration of the 20th anniversary of economic
reforms that moved the communist nation toward a market economy and
urged Chinese to become wealthy.
	   Her book, ``The Pitfalls of Modernization,'' also hits a nerve
because a large population of people are still poor and resent
officials who profit from special privileges.
	   ``Most got rich through corruption, and not by producing
anything,'' He said in an interview.
	   Published 11 months ago, ``Pitfalls'' became a sensation.
Bookstalls in subways and airports sold it alongside other
bestsellers peeking into the love lives of ordinary Chinese or
charting the course to a Harvard MBA.
	   He (pronounced Huh) estimates 170,000 legitimate copies and 1
million pirated editions of the 394-page paperback were sold.
Chinese newspapers and television news covered the 41-year-old
economist so extensively she was barraged for autographs.
	   ``Pitfalls'' argues China will only become a 21st century power
if it can root out the corruption blocking its modernization. It
also contends the economy is an ``imitation market economy''
because instead of the market distributing resources, it's really
run by the ``invisible hand of the government.''
	   The government continues to determine how resources are
allocated and who gets lucrative government contracts, and in the
process officials have ample opportunities to enrich themselves, He
says.
	   He's sources are largely newspaper accounts of bankers, police,
factory managers and civil leaders using their connections for
personal gain.
	   The writer's home for the past decade has been Shenzhen, a
boomtown near Hong Kong that offers plenty of examples of the
economy's ills. A fishing village before the reforms started, the
southern city has a reputation for corruption and crime.
	   ``We used to think that as the economic reforms got going, the
role of the government in the economy would become less and less.
But it hasn't happened that way,'' she said, sitting in a rocker
beside her computer in a spare apartment she keeps as an office,
with book-lined walls and polished wooden floors in a 32-story
building.
	   There's nothing to stop the corrupt officials, He said.
State-controlled news media are limited in their ability to expose
corruption, she said. Her book blames a backward legal system and
political power concentrated in few hands.
	   He's book is one of a half-dozen published in the past year that
have critiqued defects in China's political and economic structure.
The one thing that sets ``Pitfalls'' apart is it confronts the
issue of official corruption.
	   Because He doesn't work for the government, she had more freedom
to be critical than other economists whose wages come from the
state. But she stopped short of targeting the Communist Party,
avoiding the repressive measures taken against dissidents who
attack the party's monopoly on power.
	   Last August, party officials invited her to Beijing to address a
small meeting of academics. She also has lectured at Peking
University and other schools.
	   Still, getting published in China wasn't easy. For more than a
year she heard publishers praise her work but refuse to publish it.
Eventually it was brought to the attention of Liu Ji of the
government's China Academy of Social Sciences, who sponsored it as
part of series on China's problems.
	   President Jiang Zemin has for several years campaigned
stridently against corruption. State-controlled media regularly
report cases of government officials imprisoned or executed for
corruption.
	   But He said punishing corruption after the fact isn't enough if
nothing prevents it from reoccurring.
	   ``The conclusions people draw from this book is that China must
implement deep political reforms,'' she said.

Soldier dies from injuries received during training accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUFFIELD, Alberta (AP) _ A 19-year-old British soldier died
Monday from head injuries received during a training accident last
week at Canadian Forces Base Suffield.
	   The soldier, whose name has not yet been released, died in a
Calgary hospital. He was among three members of the 1st Battalion
Irish Guards who were hurt when their vehicle flipped over on Oct.
20.
	   The other two were released from the hospital in Medicine Hat
and put back on training.
	   Relatives of the soldier were flown in from the United Kingdom
to be at their son's bedside. The soldier was part of a battle
group with the British Army Training Unit Suffield.
	   Military police are investigating the accident.

U.S., Israel vote against Libya resolution on sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted 80-2, with 67
abstentions Monday on a non-binding resolution sponsored by Libya
calling for an end to sanctions used for individual political
agendas.
	   The United States and Israel _ which traditionally sides with
America on General Assembly resolutions _ cast the lone dissenting
votes. Countries currently under U.S. sanctions voted in favor of
the measure, including Iraq, Cuba, India and Pakistan.
	   On the whole, Arab, African and Latin American states voted
overwhelmingly to adopt the resolution, which called for the
immediate repeal of sanctions and urged U.N. member not recognize
sanctions imposed by others.
	   The United States urged countries to vote against the
resolution, which it said was an attempt by Libya to divert
attention from its obligations under U.N. sanctions.
	   ``Member states should understand that this draft resolution is
not about unilateralism, coercion, compulsion or
extraterritoriality,'' said the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter
Burleigh.
	   ``The fact is, key sanctions on Libya are imposed by the United
Nations,'' he said.
	   The Security Council imposed a travel ban on Libya to force it
to turn over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
	   The council has agreed to suspend the measures once Libya turns
over the two intelligence agents for trial in the Netherlands,
under a deal to use Scottish judges and Scottish law.
	   Britain and France, which also wants Libyan cooperation in the
crash of a French jet, were among those countries that abstained
from the vote.

Hyundai chief crosses into North Korea with 501 cattle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chung's statement, other details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo
 &UR; By J.H. YUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ The founder of South Korea's largest
conglomerate drove 501 more cattle across the world's most heavily
armed border Tuesday in a move government officials hoped would
help thaw relations with North Korea.
	   Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, walked
across the border at the neutral truce village of Panmunjom shortly
after a convoy of 51 trucks carrying the cattle moved into the
northern part of the peninsula.
	   Wearing a hat and a trench coat, the 84-year-old Chung smiled
and waved as he walked into the North, accompanied by four family
members and Hyundai executives. It was Chung's second trip to his
native North Korea in four months.
	   ``It's the greatest pleasure in my life that I can do something
that will help all of our people live together in prosperity,''
Chung said in a statement read before crossing the border.
	   Chung visited the reclusive North in June with an initial 500
cattle. Chung's second gift Tuesday was valued at 2 billion won
(dlrs 1.5 million) and included 20 Hyundai passenger cars.
	   ``This time, Mr. Chung will finalize a tourism project being
pushed by Hyundai, which will certainly have a positive effect on
the overall inter-Korea relations,'' said Lee Ho, the chief analyst
at the government's Unification Ministry.
	   Relations between the rival Koreas are icy because of continuing
military and political tensions. The two Koreas are technically at
war, with no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War.
	   South Korea's new government led by President Kim Dae-jung is
actively pushing non-governmental exchanges with North Korea under
its ``sunshine policy'' aimed at opening up the North's closed
society.
	   Hyundai officials said Chung expects to meet the North's new
leader, Kim Jong Il, during this week's visit, which has been
extended by one day to four days at the North's request. North
Korean officials had promised in June that Chung would be allowed
to meet the leader during his second visit, they said.
	   The cattle donation is part of Hyundai's effort to do business
in North Korea, including tourism, car assembly and ship repair
projects.
	   Hyundai already has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai officials said the exact date of the first tour will be
decided during Chung's visit. They hope the first ship can sail in
mid-November.
	   Hyundai officials said they are seeking a 30-year contract for
the exclusive right to use and develop Diamond Mountain for
sightseeing. North Korea, in return, reportedly is demanding dlrs
942 million in cash over the next six years.
	   The second cattle donation was delayed because of North Korean
accusations that 71 of the 500 cattle donated in June died because
of a South Korean government plot to kill the animals by
force-feeding them indigestible materials.
	   A survey of other Hyundai cattle being raised at the group's
ranch found that some of them also have indigestible hemp rope and
vinyl strips in their stomachs, apparently picked up from the
landfill used to build up the area.
	   North Korea then called the issue a misunderstanding and South
Korea dropped its demand for an apology, clearing the way for
Chung's second visit.
	   Hyundai officials said they have taken precautions to assure
that none of the 501 cattle to be donated Tuesday have such
problems.

Australia: U.N. protocol would raise age limit for young soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia was working with a United
Nations team on a protocol that would outlaw the recruitment of
children into the world's armies, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Tuesday.
	   The protocol would seek to strengthen existing standards by
raising the minimum age limit _ currently set at 15 years _ for
recruitment into the armed forces and participation in armed
conflict, Downer told an Australian Red Cross seminar.
	   Australia was working with the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights working group on a draft optional protocol.
	   ``The protocol seeks to address what has become a seriously
widespread problem: the use of children in warfare, either directly
by bearing arms or in supporting roles,'' Downer said.
	   ``Once the protocol is adopted and entered into force, underage
recruitment or involvement of children in armed conflict will be
unlawful in international law for those states that choose to
become party to the protocol.''
	   He said adoption of a new instrument was clearly insufficient
without other practical measures.
	   ``However, it will benefit children by establishing a new
standard against which international behavior can be measured.
	   ``Through Australia's continued active involvement, we can
hopefully ensure that the protocol develops into an effective
instrument that will raise international standards and, in
combination with practical measures, improve the situation of
children worldwide,'' Downer said.
	   At the seminar, Downer met two young landmine victims, Sandra
Txijica of Angola, and Song Kosal of Cambodia, both 13.
	   They were in Australia as guests of the Australian Red Cross and
have urged support for an international ban on landmines.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Tuesday
on speculation the Bank of China was poised to sell dollars and on
rekindled concern over hedge funds' exposure to losses in emerging
markets. Tokyo stock prices declined slightly.
	   The dollar bought 118.98 yen in late morning trading, down 0.04
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its New York rate of
119.10 yen in late trading overnight.
	   The dollar weakened in Tokyo on rumors the Bank of China has
outstanding offers to sell the U.S. currency at the 119 yen level,
traders said.
	   They also said the dollar was hurt by worry over the health of
U.S. hedge funds following word that investor George Soros plans to
shut down his dlrs 1.5 billion Quantum Emerging Growth Fund.
	   In New York trading, the dollar had risen against the yen and
other major currencies after Italy cut interest rates. The
long-awaited move by the Bank of Italy was expected to pave the way
for more rate cuts in Europe.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 42.67 points, or 0.31 percent, to 13,800.84 as
of midday. On Monday, the average closed down 301.24 points, or
2.13 percent.
	   The market opened higher on a report the government plans to
increase stimulus spending, but gave back its early gains in light
trading. A dearth of fresh incentives prevented stocks from making
decisive losses or gains, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 4.78 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,043.96.
The TOPIX had closed down 19.41 points, or 1.81 percent, the day
before.
	   Shares were buoyed at the outset of trading after the Nihon
Keizai business daily said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may
hike spending in a new supplementary budget to 1 trillion yen (dlrs
8.47 billion), traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.880 percent from Monday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 108.17 yen from 108.27 yen.

Sides meet at secret site; progress reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 2 grafs on meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association owners and
players shut themselves in a conference room at a secret location,
making their strongest effort to date at trying to end the lockout.
	   ``Everyone is trying to make a deal, there's a lot of stuff
being thrown around,'' a source involved in the talks told The
Associated Press on Monday.
	   The meeting, which included about 20 people from the union and
12 from the league, began at midafternoon and lasted well into the
evening. Several sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, said that progress was made, although they differed on
how substantial that progress was.
	   One thing, however, was clear: This was shaping up as a week in
which the sides could choose between confrontation and compromise.
	   ``My reading is that they wouldn't be meeting unless there was
some significant movement on the part of the owners, or at least
the possibility of movement,'' said agent Mark Fleisher, a member
of the union's agents advisory council.
	   The sides met for about three hours Saturday to conclude a
contentious week that included arbitrator John Feerick's decision
on owners' liability for guaranteed contracts and the union's
militant meeting in Las Vegas.
	   Details of Saturday's session were a closely guarded secret. So
secret, in fact, that two sources very close to Stern and union
director Billy Hunter _ one aligned with management, one with the
players _ said they were being kept in the dark, too.
	   ``Billy won't give up the ship, not after what happened with the
players in Las Vegas,'' Fleisher said. ``So the fact that they're
meeting could be a positive sign.''
	   Any compromise would likely include movement from both sides on
the use of a ``luxury tax'' to deter owners from signing their best
players to overly lucrative contracts under the so-called ``Larry
Bird exception.''
	   The union has proposed a 50 percent tax on the amount of any
annual salary exceeding dlrs 18 million, and the owners have
proposed a tax of anywhere from 50 to 200 percent on any Bird
contract of more than dlrs 2.6 million annually.
	   If the sides can come up with a compromise number that would
effectively set a maximum salary, they would seem to be on the way
to coming up with an agreement that leaves more money for the
middle class of players that was shrinking under the old labor
agreement.
	   One possible point of contention could be the owners' insistence
on having a hard salary cap as a fallback in case a tax system
failed to reduce the amount of basketball-related income devoted to
player salaries.
	   In their last proposal, the league asked that the percentage be
reduced from its current 57 percent to 52 percent in the 2000-01
season, 50 percent in 2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The players voted unanimously in Las Vegas never to accept a
hard cap.
	   The union has offered two cap-tightening mechanisms if the
salary percentage reaches 63 percent.
	   Monday's talks _ the seventh joint session _ came in advance of
a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. And they may
be Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward settling a
dispute that has lasted nearly four months and has forced the
league to cancel games for the first time in its history.

Viloca upsets Squillari in Mexico City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Juan Albert Viloca, a finalist here a year
ago, upset eighth-seeded Franco Squillari of Argentina 4-6, 7-6
(7-2), 6-4 Monday in the Mexican Open tennis tournament.
	   Squillari was the only seeded player to see action on the

Sprewell sues agent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Golden State guard Latrell Sprewell, who was
suspended by the National Basketball Association for 68 games for
choking his coach, sued his agent Monday for failing to negotiate a
salary protection clause in his contract with the Warriors.
	   Sprewell claimed in the Los Angeles Superior Court suit that,
because agent Arn Tellem did not negotiate a personal conduct
salary protection clause, he lost pay for the games he was
suspended.
	   Sprewell's three-year, dlrs 24 million contract was terminated
by the Warriors after he choked coach P.J. Carlesimo during
practice Dec. 1.
	   The NBA added a one-year suspension, but an arbitrator
reinstated Sprewell to the Warriors and cut the suspension to the
68 games remaining in the 1997-98 season.
	   Calls to Tellem's office were not immediately returned.

After tumultuous season, Piazza staying with Mets

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a tumultuous season in which he was traded
twice, booed by Mets fans, and then nearly carried the team into
the playoffs, Mike Piazza decided he likes New York after all.
	   The All-Star catcher agreed Monday to a dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the Mets in the richest deal in U.S. Major
League Baseball history. Piazza's contract, which averages dlrs 13
million a season, tops the dlrs 75 million, six-year agreement that
pitcher Pedro Martinez agreed to with Boston last December.
	   ``I definitely had some growing pains coming here,'' Piazza
said. ``Once I went through the ups and downs of New York, I
definitely wanted to finish my career here.''
	   Piazza, 30, could have become a free agent but opted instead to
stay with the Mets, who competed for the National League wild-card
berth until the final weekend of the season.
	   ``The Mets showed incredible commitment to me,'' Piazza said.
``If I'm so fortunate as to go into the Hall of Fame someday, it
definitely will be in a Mets uniform.''
	   He hit .329 this year with 32 home runs and 111 RBIs, getting
dlrs 8 million in the final season of a dlrs 15 million, two-year
deal. After the Dodgers failed to sign him to a multiyear deal last
spring, he was traded from Los Angeles to Florida in May. The
Marlins traded him to the Mets a week later.
	   Piazza gets a dlrs 7.5 million signing bonus, dlrs 4 million
payable on Feb. 1 and the rest on Dec. 15, 2002. The Mets will pay
him salaries of dlrs 6 million in 1999, dlrs 11 million in 2000,
dlrs 12.5 million in 2001, dlrs 9.5 million in 2002, dlrs 14.5
million in 2003 and dlrs 15 million in both 2004 and 2005.
	   In addition, the Mets agreed to give him a suite on all road
trips and use of a luxury box for all games at Shea Stadium. If the
Mets move to a new ballpark during the term of the contract, he
would get a luxury box for 40 regular-season home games and all
postseason home games.
	   Piazza would get bonuses of dlrs 50,000 for making the All-Star
team, dlrs 50,000 for a Gold Glove, dlrs 50,000 for a Silver Bat,
dlrs 100,000 for the World Series MVP award, dlrs 50,000 for the
league championship MVP and dlrs 25,000 for the division series MVP
_ an award that currently doesn't exist.
	   He also would get dlrs 125,000 if he's voted the NL MVP, dlrs
100,000 for finishing second, dlrs 75,000 for third, dlrs 50,000
for fourth and dlrs 25,000 for fifth.
	   In addition, he gets a limited no-trade clause, although there
is a dispute whether gets a total no-trade in May 2003 _ all
10-year veterans who have been with a team for five seasons have
the right to veto trades under baseball's labor agreement.
	   The deal is a clear signal the Mets will try to trade catcher
Todd Hundley, who is to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next season and
dlrs 6 million in 2000 as part of a dlrs 21 million, four-year
contract.

Sides meet at secret site; progress reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association owners and
players shut themselves in a conference room at a secret location
Monday night, making their strongest effort to date at trying to
end the lockout.
	   ``We made some progress, but not a lot of progress,'' Danny
Schayes, a member of the union's executive committee, said after
the 7 1/2-hour session that included about 20 people from the union
and 12 from the league.
	   The sides agreed to meet throughout the week.
	   ``Everyone is trying to make a deal, there's a lot of stuff
being thrown around,'' a source involved in the talks told The
Associated Press.
	   Several sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said progress was made, although they differed on how substantial
that progress was.
	   One thing, however, was clear: This was shaping up as a week in
which the sides could choose between confrontation and compromise.
	   ``My reading is that they wouldn't be meeting unless there was
some significant movement on the part of the owners, or at least
the possibility of movement,'' said agent Mark Fleisher, a member
of the union's agents advisory council.
	   The sides met for about three hours Saturday to conclude a
contentious week that included arbitrator John Feerick's decision
on owners' liability for guaranteed contracts and the union's
militant meeting in Las Vegas.
	   Details of Saturday's session were a closely guarded secret. So
secret, in fact, that two sources very close to Stern and union
director Billy Hunter _ one aligned with management, one with the
players _ said they were being kept in the dark, too.
	   ``Billy won't give up the ship, not after what happened with the
players in Las Vegas,'' Fleisher said. ``So the fact that they're
meeting could be a positive sign.''
	   Any compromise would likely include movement from both sides on
the use of a ``luxury tax'' to deter owners from signing their best
players to overly lucrative contracts under the so-called ``Larry
Bird exception.''
	   The union has proposed a 50 percent tax on the amount of any
annual salary exceeding dlrs 18 million, and the owners have
proposed a tax of anywhere from 50 to 200 percent on any Bird
contract of more than dlrs 2.6 million annually.
	   If the sides can come up with a compromise number that would
effectively set a maximum salary, they would seem to be on the way
to coming up with an agreement that leaves more money for the
middle class of players that was shrinking under the old labor
agreement.
	   One possible point of contention could be the owners' insistence
on having a hard salary cap as a fallback in case a tax system
failed to reduce the amount of basketball-related income devoted to
player salaries.
	   In their last proposal, the league asked that the percentage be
reduced from its current 57 percent to 52 percent in the 2000-01
season, 50 percent in 2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   The players voted unanimously in Las Vegas never to accept a
hard cap.
	   The union has offered two cap-tightening mechanisms if the
salary percentage reaches 63 percent.
	   Monday's talks _ the seventh joint session _ came in advance of
a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. And they may
be Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward settling a
dispute that has lasted nearly four months and has forced the
league to cancel games for the first time in its history.
	   The owners' labor committee, which is to meet Tuesday, includes
David Checketts (Knicks), Mickey Arison (Heat), Gordon Gund
(Cavaliers), Les Alexander (Rockets), Jerry Colangelo (Suns), Peter
Holt (Spurs), Larry Miller (Jazz), Jerry Buss (Lakers) and Abe
Pollin (Wizards).
	   On Wednesday, the full board is expected to meet with dozens,
perhaps hundreds, of players. Plans for such an assembly are
incomplete, but both sides talked as if they expected such a
meeting to take place.
	   By inviting all the players, Hunter seems to be gambling that if
the owners see a unified front they will be more willing to
compromise. And if Stern isn't willing to soften his stance, Hunter
thinks his players will be resolved to fight even harder.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and probably some December games _ will be canceled this week. So
far, only the first two weeks of the season have been scrapped.

Former Japan company president arrested over tainted salmon roe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The former president of a fisheries processing
company on Hokkaido was arrested Tuesday for allegedly selling
salmon roe tainted with E. coli bacteria that sickened dozens of
people, a police spokesman said.
	   Toru Ise, who headed Marusan Notsuke Bussan, was arrested on
suspicion of professional negligence resulting in injury and death,
said Kuniyoshi Omori, a spokesman for the Hokkaido prefectural, or
state, police.
	   The arrest marks the first time that a food-making operator in
Japan faces criminal responsibility for a food poisoning outbreak
caused by the O-157 strain of the E. coli bacteria, Omori said.
	   If convicted, Ise could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison or be fined 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,230), Omori said.
	   Police believe Ise, whose company is now being liquidated,
allegedly sold about 3.6 tons of salmon roe to a food company in
Tokyo in April and June knowing the product was tainted with E.
coli bacteria, Omori said.
	   Omori said the salmon roe shipped was then distributed to a
large number of sushi shops in seven prefectures, sickening dozens
of customers, some seriously, who had consumed it.
	   Omori said Ise's company was based in Bekkaicho, located 973
kilometers (605 miles), northwest of Tokyo. Hokkaido is Japan's
northernmost main island.
	   In 1996, food contaminated with the O-157 strain claimed 12
lives and sickened more than 10,000 people in Japan. Most of the
afflicted were children and the elderly, who have less resistance
to bacterial infections. E. coli causes severe, bloody diarrhea and
stomach cramps.

	   _ Andre Agassi captured the IPB Czech Indoor in Ostrava, Czech
Republic, by beating Jan Kroslak 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
	   _ Alex Corretja downed Tommy Haas 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 to win the
Lyon Grand Prix in Lyon, France.
	   _ Mary Pierce won the Kremlin Cup by stopping Monica Seles 7-6
(7-2), 6-3 in Moscow.
	   _ John McEnroe defeated Johan Kriek 7-5, 6-3 to take the Harvey
Norman Champions in Melbourne, Australia
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``In this tournament I played some ugly matches, and I was just
lucky to win them.'' _ Mary Pierce, after winning the Kremlin Cup.
	   ``There is more interest in the personalities and rivalries in a
sense with the women and you've got to give them credit for that.''
_ John McEnroe, saying women's tennis gaining in popularity over
the men's game.
	   ``It's a stupid rule. ... Jennifer (Capriati) can't come out and
play four games of hit-and-giggle because there's a tournament in
Moscow?'' _ Chris Evert, upset with a Corel WTA Tour rule that
prevents active pros from playing in charity events the same time a
tournament is being held.
	   ``For me deep down, I think it is I just love to play tennis. I
love the game. I really enjoy the everyday practicing for it and
the competition. As long as I have that passion for it I will keep
playing.'' _ Monica Seles, asked what motivates her tennis now.
	   ``In the last six games of the final set I played some of my
best tennis this year. I think I was pretty lucky, too.'' _ Andre
Agassi, after rallying from an 0-4 deficit in the final set to beat
Thomas Johansson 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4 in the quarterfinals of the
Czech Indoor.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SEASON-ENDERS &QC; 
	   Mary Pierce along with first-time qualifier Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium and Sandrine Testud of France are the latest to qualify
for the dlrs 2 million season-ending Chase Championships of the
Corel WTA Tour at New York's Madison Square Garden the week of Nov.
16. Already in the field are U.S. Open champion Lindsay Davenport,
Australian Open winner Martina Hingis, French Open champ Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, Wimbledon winner Jana Novotna, Venus Williams,
Monica Seles, Conchita Martinez, Anna Kournikova and Patty
Schnyder. These 12 will be joined by four more women in a lineup
that features four different Grand Slam winners for the first time
since 1990.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STRANGE DRAW &QC; 
	   Tommy Haas had a lot of luck and very little match play on his
second consecutive trip to the final of the Lyon Grand Prix. Haas
won his quarterfinal when top-seeded Pete Sampras withdrew with an
aching back. The young German then captured his semifinal when No.
2-ranked Marcelo Rios withdrew in the second set with a strained
hamstring. ``I have been very lucky this week,'' the 20-year-old
Haas said. ``But don't forget that I had to win matches to reach
the quarterfinal.'' Haas lost to Alex Corretja in the title match.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SURGING &QC; 
	   With his fifth title of the year, Andre Agassi has regained a
spot in the top five in the world rankings for the first time in
more than two years. His victory in the Czech Indoor final also
qualified Agassi for the year-ending ATP Tour World Championships
in Hanover, Germany. Agassi, who has reached 10 finals this year,
has not been ranked so high since 1996 _ which also was the year he
was No. 1 for two weeks. Last year, he was ranked 141st in the
world.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STYLISH SPANIARD &QC; 
	   When Alex Corretja won the Lyon Grand Prix in Lyon, France, he
became the first Spaniard to win a men's indoor tournament in 22
years. Manuel Orantes was the last Spaniard to achieve an indoor
triumph, and that came at the 1976 Masters in Houston when he
outlasted Wojtek Fibak in five sets. Corretja saved a match point
in the second set of the 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 victory over Tommy
Haas. The victory also qualified the Spaniard for the season-ending
ATP Tour World Championships, which will be held in Hanover,
Germany, next month.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SUNRISE CANCELED &QC; 
	   An event billed as the richest women's doubles exhibition in
history, the dlrs 300,000 Women's World Doubles Championship, has
been canceled. The event, scheduled for Nov. 27 in Sunrise,
Florida, would have featured Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Anna
Kournikova and Jana Novotna. According to the Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.-based promotions company run by longtime tennis promoter
George Liddy, the exhibition was canceled because ``the proposed
sponsor of the event had to withdraw its support due to changes in
business and market conditions.''
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SITTING DOWN &QC; 
	   Sebastien DeChaunac, the No. 1 men's tennis player at the
University of Mississippi, will sit out his team's first two
matches next spring. The NCAA reprimanded DeChaunac for an outburst
last May at the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championships in
Athens, Georgia, when at the end of a singles match he lost to John
Roddick of Georgia, DeChaunac lost his temper and broke his racket.
The NCAA said it was reprimanding DeChaunac for unsportsmanlike
conduct and accepted the two-match penalty imposed by Ole Miss.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SYNTHETIC FOR SYDNEY &QC; 
	   The main tennis court in the Sydney Olympics will be modeled on
Wimbledon's new No. 1 court. The arena has been designed by Richard
Rees, the man responsible for No. 1 Court at the All England Club,
but the surface in Sydney will be synthetic rather than grass.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SUCCESSFUL TOURNEY &QC; 
	   The popularity of women's tennis worldwide was never more
evident then in Moscow at the Ladies Kremlin Cup. The singles
final, where Mary Pierce defeated Monica Seles, drew a tournament
single-day record crowd of 14,911.

Survey shows percentage of smokers in Japan falls to record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The percentage of Japanese adults who smoke has
fallen for a third straight year and now stands at a record low,
according to a survey released Tuesday.
	   The survey was conducted in May by Japan Tobacco Inc., the
country's biggest tobacco company. It showed that the percentage of
adult smokers in Japan fell 1 percentage point from last year to
33.6 percent.
	   Smoking was less common this year than last for both men and
women. Still, more than half, or 55.2 percent, of men over the age
of 19 smoked, the results showed. Last year, 56.1 percent of adult
Japanese men said they were smokers.
	   The percentage of women who smoked fell 1.2 percentage points
from last year to 13.3 percent, according to the survey.
	   Japan Tobacco sent surveys to 16,000 people around Japan and
11,050, or 69.1 percent, responded. No margin of error was given.
	   By age-group, smoking was most common among those 60 and over at
26.8 percent. But just 15.1 percent of women in their 20s said they
were smokers.
	   Smoking is more common in Japan than in the United States where
about 25 percent of adults smoke. But the percentage of people here
who smoke is down sharply from 1966, when a Japan Tobacco survey
said nearly half of all adults smoked.

Korean president to visit China, APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung will visit
Beijing Nov. 11-15 to discuss economic cooperation and peace on the
divided Korean Peninsula with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Kim also is scheduled to meet with Premier Zhu Rongji and other
senior Chinese leaders and visit Shanghai, China's No. 2 city, his
office said Tuesday.
	   China is the third of the four major powers that President Kim
promised to visit to strengthen ties when he took office in March.
	   Kim visited the United States in June and Japan earlier this
month. Officials were talking with Moscow to plan Kim's possible
trip to Russia.
	   The Seoul government believes the four countries will play a
vital role in its plan to negotiate a peace treaty with rival
communist North Korea.
	   China, which fought on North Korea's side during the 1950-53
Korean War, is working with Washington to mediate peace talks
between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war.
	   The Korean conflict ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty,
and the two Koreas remain bitter enemies, with their border heavily
fortified.
	   Kim will visit Shanghai Nov. 14 and from there, he will fly to
Kuala Lumpur the next day to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   On the sidelines of the summit conference, Kim will hold
separate talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Chilean President Eduardo
Frei, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Australian
Prime Minister John Howard.
	   The South Korean leader will return home Nov. 20 after a one-day
stopover in Hong Kong.

Report: Privatization of Indonesian steel maker delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Plans to privatize Indonesia's
state-owned steel manufacturer PT Krakatau Steel will be delayed
until 2000 because of depressed steel prices, a local newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted the steel company's president Sutrisno
as saying that the privatization plan, originally scheduled for
this fiscal year, will be delayed.
	   The report cited plunging steel prices as the main cause.
	   Prices have reached a record low of dlrs 200 per ton from
between dlrs 310 and dlrs 370 per ton early last year.
	   Krakatau Steel is among 12 state-owned enterprises tagged for
privatization this fiscal year to raise funds to plug the
government's large budget deficit.
	   The government has also postponed a plan to privatize the
domestic telecommunication provider PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia,
citing unfavorable market conditions.
	   The sale of state assets is regarded as a major part of an
economic rescue program sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund to help Indonesia overcome its worst financial crisis in 30
years.

UN envoy dispatched to Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After having his original candidate
rejected by Myanmar, the U.N. chief has dispatched another special
envoy to look into the human rights situation in the Southeast
Asian country, U.N. officials said Monday.
	   Assistant Secretary-General Alvaro de Soto will be in Myanmar
through Friday, spokesman Hiro Ueki said. De Soto was last in the
country in January.
	   In August, Myanmar rejected Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
candidate to look into the military regime's treatment of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize.
	   Annan had asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, the former
president of the General Assembly, be allowed to make a quick trip
after the Myanmar government had repeatedly blocked Suu Kyi's
attempts to travel outside the capital to meet with members of her
political party, the National League for Democracy.
	   Myanmar rejected the idea, saying there was no need for such a
rushed trip.
	   The United States, among others, had sought Annan's intervention
to try to rally world opinion against Myanmar's rulers.

Sides meet at secret site; talk about compromise economic system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The opposing sides in the NBA lockout met for
much of the day Monday and finally started talking in detail about
a compromise, making it the most productive negotiating session
they've had to date.
	   ``There's hope,'' said Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks.
	   One participant said the league backed off somewhat on its
demand for a hard salary cap, meaning the sides have to be closer,
at least in principle, to coming to an agreement on the main
economic issues.
	   ``The best thing is we have some sort of an agreement on basic
principles,'' said Orlando center Danny Schayes, a member of the
union's executive committee.
	   ``Right now we're talking about a hybrid system. The first
couple of years it would work one way, for another couple of years
it would work another way if the first way didn't work. At least
we're finding some common ground,'' Schayes said.
	   About 20 people from the union and 10 from the league worked
through the afternoon and into the night at a luxury Manhattan
hotel. The site was kept a secret to avoid the circus atmosphere
that has surrounded past negotiating sessions.
	   Most participants left after about 7 1/2 hours, but a few
members from each side continued talking into the night.
	   Despite the stealthiness and the reluctance of most of the
principals to discuss details, it was eminently clear that the
sides were moving away from confrontation and toward compromise.
	   The league was asking to operate under a luxury tax system for
the next three seasons, with a fallback system of a harder salary
cap for the next three years. The union was asking for a tax system
lasting two years, with the fallback system lasting another two
years, Schayes said.
	   ``Instead of absolute cost certainty, there would be mechanisms
that give the owners a very good shot at costs within a certain
range. So it's a good compromise in that area,'' Schayes said.
	   Still, the sides had not made any movement on whose contracts
would be taxable and how high the tax would be. In earlier
bargaining sessions, the union proposed a 50 percent tax on the
amount of any annual salary exceeding dlrs 18 million, and the
owners proposed a tax of anywhere from 50 to 200 percent on any
contract signed under the Larry Bird exception for more than dlrs
2.6 million annually.
	   The sides have agreed to meet throughout the week.
	   Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik, union
director Billy Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing met for
about three hours Saturday to conclude a contentious week that
included arbitrator John Feerick's decision on owners' liability
for guaranteed contracts and the union's militant meeting in Las
Vegas.
	   The league did not immediately comment.
	   Monday's talks _ the seventh joint session _ came in advance of
a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. It was
Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward settling a dispute
that has lasted nearly four months and has forced the league to
cancel games for the first time in its history.
	   In their previous proposal, the owners insisted upon having a
hard salary cap as a fallback in case a tax system failed to reduce
the amount of basketball-related income devoted to player salaries.
	   Under that fallback proposal, each player would have a
percentage of his salary deducted from his paycheck and put into an
escrow account. At the end of the season, if the amount of revenue
devoted to salaries had not dropped to 52 percent, enough of that
escrow money would be returned to the owners to hit the targeted
percentages _ 52 percent in the 2000-01 season, 50 percent in
2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and probably some December games _ will be canceled this week. So
far, only the first two weeks of the season have been scrapped.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An editor for the Mexican edition of Le Monde
Diplomatique has been found slain and officials say they are
investigating the killing.
	   The body of Claudio Cortes Garcia was discovered Friday in the
back seat of a car. The Mexico City attorney general's office said
in a news release late Monday that he had been strangled 12 to 14
hours before his body was found.
	   ``I was a very, very, very strange thing,'' said Eda Chavez,
director of the monthly publication.
	   ``He did not arrive at his house since Tuesday night. Friday
night we found his body,'' she said. ``I understand the
investigations are continuing because apparently there was no
robbery.''
	   Cortes, a Mexican, was the layout editor for the French
newspaper's Mexican edition, which resumed publication last year.
It had been suspended in the mid-1980s after its then-director,
Ivan Melendez, was slain.
	   Chavez said that Cortes also worked as an editor for the
magazine La Crisis and had earlier worked for several other Mexican
publications, including the daily newspaper Reforma.
	   She said he was 32 years old and left a wife and a month-old
son.
	   Several other journalists have been assaulted in Mexico City
over the past year, but most of the cases appear to be part of the
capital's general crime wave.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained one of China's most prominent
dissidents and an associate Tuesday, disrupting their plans to set
off on a cross-country trip to protest the harassment of a fellow
activist.
	   More than 10 police went to Xu Wenli's home, took him away for
questioning and searched his home for two hours, confiscating a fax
machine, papers, magazines and photos, said Xu's wife, He Xintong.
	   Zhang Hui, an associate of Xu's who spent the night at their
home, also was detained, she said. She did not know how long they
would be held.
	   She said the detentions demonstrated that Chinese authorities
have no intention of relaxing their grip despite their signing
earlier this month of a U.N. human rights treaty, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
	   ``This is their real face,'' she said in an interview. ``The
Communist Party says one thing but does another.''
	   Xu, Zhang, and at least three other Beijing dissidents had
planned to drive to eastern Shandong province in Xu's jeep in a
show of support for another democracy activist, Xie Wanjun, who has
been harassed for his activities.
	   Xie was detained last month and held for 15 days for attempting
to file an application with the authorities to set up an opposition
group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Since July, dissidents have tried the register branches of the
party in at least nine provinces and major cities, challenging a
virtual 49-year ban on organized opposition to the ruling Communist
Party.
	   Authorities have rejected all the applications and detained at
least 20 dissidents, mostly for short periods of time.
	   After his release, Xie was ordered to move out of his home by
November 1 and his wife was sacked from her job as a teacher. Xie
accused police of forcing his former employer to evict him from his
home.
	   In a telephone call Monday, Xie also said his home's electricity
and telephone had been cut off, said Xu's wife.
	   ``It's too much,'' she said.
	   As many as 30 dissidents from Beijing and elsewhere in the
country planned to set off Tuesday for Shandong's Dongping county,
some 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Beijing, to protest Xie's
treatment, Xu said Monday before he was detained.
	   Police sought repeatedly in recent days to dissuade Xu from
making the trip. Xu said he would call it off if Xie's wife got her
job back, and if they were allowed to keep their home, said Xu's
wife.
	   With many other dissidents exiled abroad, Xu, 56, is one of the
most prominent democracy campaigners left in China. That makes him
a frequent target for police harassment.
	   His activism dates back to the Democracy Wall protest movement
of the late 1970s. Xu was arrested and freed in 1993 after serving
all but three years of a 15-year sentence, much of it in solitary
confinement.
