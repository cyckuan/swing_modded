<HEADLINE> German Trade Surplus on Course for Post-Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade surplus rose
sharply to 13.4 billion marks (7.34 billion U.S. dollars) in June
from 9.8 billion marks (5.4 billion dollars) in May and just 6.5
billion (3.6 billion dollars) in June 1996, the federal statistics
office announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wiesbaden-based office, Germany's exports
surged 23.3 percent in June in year-on-year terms and imports were
up 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1997 as a whole, German exports totaled
424 billion marks (232 billion dollars) and imports 366 billion
marks (200 billion dollars), adding up to a surplus of 58 billion
marks (32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were expecting the trade surplus to top 100
billion marks (55 billion dollars) by the end of 1997, the highest
since German reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the massive expansion in visible trade surplus,
Germany's current account balance, which includes trade in
services, also swung into a surplus of 4.0 billion marks (2.2
billion dollars) in June, compared with the deficits of 2.6
billion marks (1.4 billion dollars) in May and 0.8 billion marks
(438 million dollars) in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the current account for the first half year was still
in deficit, the gap was reduced to just 4.8 billion marks (2.6
billion dollars) compared with 6.3 billion marks (3.5 billion
dollars) a year ago.

<HEADLINE> ADB Pledges Further Support to Dhaka's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Mitsuo Sato, president of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), today said that his bank will
continue to remain a strong and committed development partner of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, he disclosed that
"in recent years, the bank has committed, on an average, about 270
million U.S. dollars every year in loans to Bangladesh. In 1997,
the bank's lending could rise to about 420 million dollars for
five projects."
</P>
<P>
The ADB president, who came here on Saturday for a three-day
visit, spoke highly of Dhaka's efforts in poverty alleviation and
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bangladeshi government was pursing a policy
conducive to economic development and expressed the hope that
Bangladesh would be in a "better position to play a more active
role in a global economic system."
</P>
<P>
The ADB is an important donor of this underdeveloped South
Asian country and since the beginning of the bank's operation in
1973, it has extended 123 loans totaling 5 billion dollars
primarily from the bank's soft loan window -- the Asian
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the sharp fall of the availability of soft
funds for development purposes, the ADB has reduced the amount of
soft loan to its member countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"In view of Bangladesh's needs, the bank will attempt to
explore new co-financing possibilities for high priority projects,
particularly for infrastructure development," said Sato.
</P>
<P>
As for the plan to construct a barrage over the Ganges river,
Sato said that his bank will field a technical team to conduct a
study in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges barrage is estimated to cost about 6 billion
dollars,
"given the size of the project, both the feasibility study and
project implementation will need to be undertaken by a consortium
of donors," Sato added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the ADB chief also called on Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, who said her government had been trying to quicken
the process of development and assistance from development
partners like the ADB would help accelerate the process.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states today rebuffed Israeli intransigent policies
regarding the Middle East peace process and the occupied Arab
territories.
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan was underlining this
GCC attitude at a meeting with the U.S. Charge D'Affairs to Saudi
Arabia on the Middle East peace process and regional issues in
Riyadh, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Hujailan also urged the U.S. to press
Israel to come back to the peace process which came to a deadlock
following Israeli implementation of its policy of constructing a
new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The situation in southern Lebanon and the U.S.-GCC relations
were also discussed at the meeting, the report said, but giving no
further details.
</P>
<P>
Israel has lately launched a wave of bomb attacks against
targets in south Lebanon. And following a Islamic militant
suicide bombing on July 30 which killed 16 persons in a Jerusalem
market, Israel implemented a three-week closure of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> UK Economists Expect Single Currency to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European single currency euro
will go ahead on schedule on January 1, 1999 with a broad
membership, according to a survey of some prominent British
economists.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the pro-European pressure group
named European Movement, revealed that a majority of those polled
agree that the single currency to be broadly successful, but none
of them expects Britain to join the European Monetary Union (EMU)
in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Those who believe that the EMU will be a success cite low
interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation as benefits of
the planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a single currency failure focus on the reduction of
monetary flexibility and the risk that the European Central Bank
will set interest rates too high.
</P>
<P>
Director of the European Movement Stephen Woodard said, "The
single currency debate in this country has suffered from too much
ill-informed speculation and too little fact."
</P>
<P>
sooddard called on Britain to make various preparations and
rational debates on the single currency as "the single currency is
going to happen."
</P>
<P>
"If Britain is to make up its mind on this crucial issue, it
must be discussed in an informed way, free from prejudice and
hype," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Visit Aimed at Building 21st Century-Oriented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's
visit to Malaysia and Singapore from August 21 to 26 has laid a
solid foundation for building a 21st century-oriented relationship
of good neighborliness and mutual trust with the countries in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
China's ties with the two countries date back to ancient
times. Recent years witnessed a strong surge in their political,
economic, trade, educational and technological cooperation. In
particular, frequent visits by their leaders greatly boosted their
mutual trust and bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li's talks with leaders of the two countries covered both
bilateral ties and regional and international issues, but the
focus was on how to build a relationship of good neighborliness
and friendly cooperation for the next century.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, both Li and his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir
Mohamad, held that despite major changes in the world since the
establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have been able
to treat their bilateral relations in the long-term and strategic
perspectives. The deepening mutual trust between their leaders
further injected a new life into bilateral cooperation which has
been gaining momentum over the years.
</P>
<P>
China and Malaysia have been working closely together on many
issues in international arena. Mahathir has on many occasions
refuted the "China threat" theory and voiced his support for
China's stand on the issue of human rights. His advocacy for a
re-examination of the 50-year-old Universal Declaration of Human
Rights also won China's appreciation and support.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers also noted that the time when a few powers
dominated the world was long gone and the current trend toward a
multi-polar world is conducive to peace and stability both in Asia
and the rest of the world. As a result, all countries and forces
in the world should strengthen consultation and coordination in
the fight against hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, whose economic and trade ties with China have
grown in strength, Li's talks with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
centered on how to expand the scope of bilateral cooperation by
tapping each other's potential.
</P>
<P>
Li told his host that China's long-term development strategy
has created broad prospects for Singaporean businessmen to play a
more active role in its economic construction.
</P>
<P>
As his visit coincided with the 30th anniversary of the
founding of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Premier Li
also took this opportunity to reaffirm China's policy on
developing good neighborly and friendly ties with the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
He unveiled a "five-point" principle governing China's future
relations with ASEAN, which includes mutual respect, closer
dialogue and consultation, mutual benefit and joint development,
and seeking common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of South China Sea which was left over by history,
Li reiterated China's principle of putting the dispute aside to
give way to joint exploration. He said that the issue should be
properly solved by peaceful means and through friendly
consultation in accordance with relevant international laws and
marine laws.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li also made a major statement on economic and trade
relations with ASEAN. By taking advantage of their supremacy, he
said, China and the ASEAN countries can cooperate more effectively
in the future, especially in the financial field.
</P>
<P>
All these statements demonstrate that China highly values the
positive role played by ASEAN in the Asia-Pacific region and hopes
to further develop ties with the regional grouping.

<HEADLINE> UK Police to Launch Drug Law Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Police Foundation, an
independent research charity, is launching a two-year inquiry into
the UK's drugs laws, and it will review the workings of the 1971
Misuse of Drugs Act.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said the study, funded by a number of
charities, will be carried out by a 12-member panel including
lawyers, academics and police officers.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry will consider whether policies pursued by
successive governments have worked. It is also expected to focus
on whether the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act needs to be changed in the
light of the scale of illegal drug use today.
</P>
<P>
It will examine the possibilities of tougher enforcement,
decriminalization, legalization and greater use of some drugs for
medicinal purposes across the range of substances covered by the
act.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said an independent and objective review in an
area where there is little consensus was overdue, and the inquiry
was set up partly because of the failure of politicians to address
drug use in Britain.

LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is
considering to establish a statutory commission with High Court
powers of investigation and prosecution to monitor various cash
payments to politicians.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin government would make it a crime for bankers,
accountants, and professional advisers not to disclose or unusual
financial transactions involving politicians or public servants to
the new commission, according to a report in today's Irish Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties may accept the proposed measures as
limited safeguards but they would insist that a new tribunal is
urgently required to investigate other controversial business and
financial decisions involving former Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Haughey, a three-time prime minister, is expected to be
severely censured by the new tribunal because of his consistent
denials that he had received 1.3 million Irish pounds (about 1.9
million U.S. dollars) from an Irish businessman.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Dismisses Turkish Community's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
dismissed the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's war threats
and expressed the hope that the peace process will continue
despite the deadlock in the direct talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
At his daily press briefing here, Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides said if Turkey, which supports the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus politically and militarily,
declares war against Cyprus, this will also mean declaration of
war against Greece, a close ally of the Greek Cypriot-ruled Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on statements made by Denktash on Monday, who
warned that if the Greek Cypriot side joins the European Union
(EU) using the name "Cyprus", the Turkish Cypriots will "justly
object" as they will not benefit from the EU accession. This will
spark a new war on the island, said Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also reiterated that he will not return to the
negotiating table unless the EU accession plans are frozen.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took over the 37 per cent of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece, one of the three guarantor powers of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the Cyprus
Republic, has warned Turkey that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island will mean war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Christofides also said that if Denktash's threats of war are
directed toward the EU, then this is "a clearly quixotic
attitude."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the wish of the Greek Cypriot side
for peace, saying that the two communities should jointly build a
"common home" and for the happiness and prosperity of all Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is a crucial period for the Cyprus
problem. "Even though the first and second round of direct talks
between President (Glafcos) Clerides and Denktash have not been
successful, the process will continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the next step which is expected to be very
serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash held two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct
talks, in July and August, which came to a deadlock due to
Denktash's insistence on the EU accession issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed on July 15 its decision that accession
negotiations with Cyprus will begin early next year. Cyprus
applied for full EU membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: De Klerk's Departure From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang &AMP; Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South African opposition
National Party leader and former South African president F.W. De
Klerk announced today that he will retire after engaging in 25 years
of political activities.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, De Klerk said he is the last
high-profile link with National Party's past and that by quitting
active politics, he hopes to boost the party's image as a new and
reformed political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his retirement from active politics, De Klerk
reiterated that there is a urgent need for political realignment
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"With my retirement, I wish to open a door for the National
Party to provide further proof of its dynamic break with the
past, with a view to best enabling it to play its full role in
the realignment process," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he will remain committed to everything which
the new National Party stands for and will continue to promote
these goals after his retirement, both inside the country and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the National Party has, at his instigation,
decided to move away from centralism and to allow for greater
autonomy of the party's regional structures.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's sudden announcement about his departure from
politics has surprised many political organizations in South
Africa, and resulted in different comments, but mainly praises.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said De Klerk's
contribution to leading South Africa from its painful past to its
present political dispensation should be recognized.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever mistakes he may have made, and it is possible that
he has made very fundamental mistakes as many of us have done, I
hope South Africa will not forget the role he has played,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for
their contribution to bringing about peaceful change in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon pointed out that De Klerk
would and should be remembered for the February 2, 1990 speech,
in which he announced Nelson Mandela's release form jail and the
unbanning of political organizations.
</P>
<P>
"While there might be other criticisms of De Klerk's
leadership, history and South Africa owed him a debt of gratitude
for this," Leon said.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Chairman of the ruling African
National Congress Women Alliance, described De Klerk's
resignation as the " second courageous concession".
</P>
<P>
Just as De Klerk had taken the right decision when he conceded
apartheid had failed, so too was his resignation a concession
that the National Party could no longer make a positive
contribution to non-racial democracy, she said.
</P>
<P>
New Process Movement leader Roelf Meyer said: "Together with
the whole of South Africa, we want to thank him today for the
courage and vision that he displayed in 1990, which helped to
lift our country from rut of the past and put it on the road
towards democratization."
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front's General Constand Viljoen welcomed De
Klerks's decision to quit his position as a "very positive
development for Afrikaner politics".
</P>
<P>
De Klerks's departure opened up the possibility of greater
solidarity of approach in the areas of self-determination and the
future of the Afrikaner, Viljoen said.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Indicates Willingness to Resume Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said today that Germany and other European Union (EU)
countries would resume contacts with Iran soon, possibly on the
occasion of the UN General Assembly meetings in New York by the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks after new Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Charrasi on Monday voiced readiness for a meeting with
Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr Kinkel was interested in such a meeting, I would welcome
it," said Charrasi in an interview with the German news agency DPA
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are also ready to resume dialogue with the EU, but so far
we have not yet received any official offer," he added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Neue Ruhr Zeitung,
Kinkel said he was in favor of resuming contact with the
apparently more liberal new government in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the UN General Assembly meetings in New York
next month would be an appropriate occasion for an initial
encounter between Charrasi and foreign ministers from Luxemburg,
the Netherlands and Britain. But he stopped short of saying
whether he himself was planning to meet his Iranian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Germany and other EU nations withdrew their ambassadors from
Iran in April after a German court linked Iranian leadership to
the killings of four Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant in
1992.
</P>
<P>
There have been renewed hopes among EU countries for improved
ties with Teheran after Iran's new president, Mohammad Khatami,
took office on August 3.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Rejects to Suspend Arm Attacks Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) today rejected the Palestinian National
Authority's (PNA) request to suspend arm attacks on Israel,
reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hamas said in a statement this afternoon that although the
PNA officials have called for a hold to the violent activities
against Israel, it viewed the arm struggle as a strategic choice
and a strong line of defense for the Palestinian people and
refused to stop it.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official confirmed that in conciliatory
talks Monday, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) asked
the Islamic militants opposed to the Oslo peace accords to stop
violent attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked the opposition groups to oppose peace deals
only through democratic and peaceful means and not through
military attacks," Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to PNA
President Yasser Arafat, said after a national unity meeting
with Muslim militants in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the (Palestinian National) Authority will by law
crack down on those who try to embarrass it by taking the law
into their own hands," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rahim said that Hamas has demanded the release of its
activists from PLO jails, but the PNA refused until Hamas
agrees to respect Arafat's peace commitments to Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the unity talks were aimed at finding common
ground between the PNA and its opponents in light of "Israel's
refusal to implement peace deals."
</P>
<P>
He said that no agreements had yet been reached and that the
talks would continue.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Destroy Last Batch of Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is to become a country
free of anti-personnel mines after it destroys its last batch of
such military devices.
</P>
<P>
A train load of more than 115,000 anti-personnel mines is
scheduled to leave Bertrix late today and head for neighboring
Germany, where the mines will be destroyed through incineration.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is not capable of destroying the mines via incineration
simply because of technical reasons, according to the local
television RTBF.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is the first country in the world to have made it a law
in 1995 banning the production, exportation and utilization of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Now all European Union member states, except for Greece and
Finland, have also decided to ban anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that upwards of 100 million
anti-personnel mines have so far been laid out throughout the
world and they combine to claim an annual casualties of 20,000
people, mostly innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Most of the live anti-personnel mines can be found in former
conflict regions such as Cambodia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia
and along former Cold-War foes like Finland and Russia.
</P>
<P>
RTBF television described anti-personnel mines as the "weapons
of the cowards."

<HEADLINE> 6 Palestinians Injured in Clash With Israelis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Six Palestinian demonstrators,
including a policeman, were injured as Israeli soldiers fired
rubber bullets and tear gas today to disperse the protesters in
the west Bank city of Bethlehem in the second day of clashes.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place near the Jewish holy site of Rachel'
Tomb. To protest the ongoing closure imposed by Israel, three
dozens of Palestinian youths threw stones at the soldiers guarding
the site, who retaliated with rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
About 10 Palestinian school children were sent to hospital for
treatment for gas inhalation after some of the gas grenades fired
by Israeli soldiers fell into their school yard, according to the
Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service the Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center.
</P>
<P>
This is the second day of clashes in Bethlehem, which is the
only West Bank city that is still under an internal travel ban
imposed by Israel. Three Palestinian protesters were wounded by
rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers during Monday's clash at
the same site.
</P>
<P>
Israel has recently lifted the internal travel ban on all
other Palestinian cities in the West Bank in a gesture to ease the
sanctions imposed following the July 30 suicide bombing attack in
Jewish west Jerusalem, which killed 16 people and injured 170
others.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
claimed responsibility for the attack. The reason that Israel
maintains the internal travel ban on Bethlehem is that it regards
the people who masterminded the Mahane Yehuda bombings might be
hiding in the city. Not long ago, Palestinian police uncovered a
Hamas bomb factory near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rising tension between the two sides due to
Israel's continued sanctions against the Palestinians, Israeli
Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak downplayed the prospect
of an immediate explosion in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Shahak noted that tension had existed in the
territories for a long time, and he did not expect the situation
to explode in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason was that everyone is now waiting for the
first visit to the region by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who is due here in the second week of
September.
</P>
<P>
However, the army chief warned that there was an accumulation
of anger and pressure in the territories, and the tension could
trigger Palestinian violence at any time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition Meretz Party's head Yossi Sarid attacked the
government for maintaining the sanctions against the
Palestinians, including the total closure, barring Palestinian
workers from entering Israel and freezing most of the tax
revenues owed to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said that if a Palestinian father of 10 children
continued to be barred from working in Israel, then he could not
feed his family. He called for an immediate end to the sanctions
in order to revive the peace process that has been stalemated
since March.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns Against Violation of Bosnia Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel threatened here today that Bonn would not hesitate to
resort to economic sanctions again in order to ensure
implementation of the Dayton peace accord in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks after Dietmar Schlee, Bonn's envoy for
the return of refugees and reconstruction in Bosnia, announced
today that Germany had lifted a freeze on aid money to the central
Bosnian town of Jajce.
</P>
<P>
"Those who block the implementation of the Dayton agreement and
the return of refugees would get no reconstruction aid anymore,"
Kinkel warned.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of 1 million German marks (550,000 US dollars) in
aid for house reparations in Jajce was frozen by Bonn early this
month after Bosnian Croats in Jajce expelled Muslim returnees and
set their homes on fire.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, the nearly one month of sanctions had
worked because a more-than-expected number of refugees had
returned to the Bosnian town by today.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
reiterated here today that China will continue to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from Singaporean businessmen before
wrapping up his three-day visit here, Li said that attracting
foreign investment is a long-term policy of China and constitutes
an important part of its reform and opening policy,
</P>
<P>
Although foreign investment dropped somewhat in the first six
months of this year to 23.3 billion U.S. dollars compared with the
same period last year, Li said, the fluctuation is quite normal
and more investment is geared toward infrastructure and high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China will continue to give tax exemption to hi-tech
projects or those with strong competitive edge in international
market."
</P>
<P>
In a question-and-answer session following a speech before
Singaporean businessmen, Li also talked about China's
determination to invigorate state-owned enterprises in its drive
to build a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that to invigorate state-run enterprises, a mechanism
is needed to merge them or declare them bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that the government must be very careful in
implementing the bankruptcy law because excessive bankruptcies may
cause high unemployment or social instability.
</P>
<P>
Li also told them that foreigners are also welcome to invest in
China's village and township enterprises, some of which are very
large and well-equipped.

<HEADLINE> National Health Service Waiting Lists Getting Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Health Service
waiting lists are soaring because the axing of tax relief has
driven people away from private health care, it was claimed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Private health insurance firms said 100,000 people have
canceled policies since the Budget released early July and up to
half a million are set to join the exodus.
</P>
<P>
Abolishing tax relief on private health insurance was a Labor
manifesto pledge designed to fund cuts in VAT on fuel.
</P>
<P>
The tax relief, claimed by 600,000 pensioners before the
Budget, cut the cost of private insurance by about a third --
worth around 40 pounds (64 US dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the cancelation would create a cash crisis
for the NHS and inevitably lead to longer waiting lists and poorer
services.
</P>
<P>
However, the British Medical Association and Department of
Health insisted that if the number of private patients slumped, a
corresponding number of doctors would return to the State sector.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said, "We are
hopeful any extra burden of patients using the NHS would be
catered for by doctors who find they have less private work."
</P>
<P>
Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrats' NHS spokesman, said that
Labor's policies have left the NHS 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion
US dollars) worse off than it should have been since the election.
</P>
<P>
According to figures gathered by Harris, who was former member
of the British Medical Association Council, the NHS has seen
real-terms cuts of at least half a billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Another half billion raised through tax changes should have
been channeled back into hospitals and doctors' surgeries but was
used for other things, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
Harris also said he had evidence that hospitals were being
forced to give priority to non-urgent operations such as breast
reductions while patients needing cataract surgery or hip
replacements were forced to wait.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of emergency admissions has already
risen ten-fold from 4,000 to 45,000 in the 14 months up to June
this year.

<HEADLINE> EU Expresses Concern About Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
regretted the fact that the direct talks on the Cyprus issue
failed to turn out any substantial outcome.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by Luxembourg, which is serving the
six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, said that
the position taken by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The union appealed that direct talks on a higher level be
convened so as to find a political solution which will be
beneficial to both sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Denktash blamed Greek Cypriots and the European
Union for the failure of the talks, held earlier last week at
Clion near Montreux, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greek Cypriot leader and President of Cyprus
Glavkos Klerides had blocked an agreement by refusing to give
Turks sovereign equality on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader then described as a bombshell the
EU's decision to start entry talks in early 1998 with the Greek
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Greece is a member of the 15-nation union whereas Turkey is
not.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided since 1974
when Turkey invaded the north in response to a coup in Nicosia
engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Set to Tighten Sanctions on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA (Nigeria), August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) is set to tighten its sanctions
on the military government of Sierra Leone, a top Nigerian
officer said here today.
</P>
<P>
A. Abubakar, Nigeria's Chief of Staff, made the revelation at
the 16th meeting of the chiefs of staff from the ECOWAS member
states, held this morning at the ECOWAS Secretariat in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"From all indications, peaceful resolutions through dialogue
have failed," in Sirrra leone, Abubakar said, referring to the
announcement made by Major Johnny Kromah that his government will
stay in power until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Kromah came into power on May 25 through a military coup in
which Sierra Leone's legitimate president Tejan Kabbah was
ousted.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS has been making efforts to reinstate Kabbah as
presidency in the past two months, but it has not made any
progress.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said,"The next option without recourse to the use of
offensive action, is the enforcement of sanctions/embargo on the
regime, through economic blocade."
</P>
<P>
He warned that Kromah's refusal to reinstall ousted president
Tejan Kabbah is meant to destabilize the peace and harmony in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the violent overthrow of Kabbah is "
capable of reversing the gains we have made in Liberia".
</P>
<P>
"If there is no peace in Sierra Leone, it will certainly be
difficult, if not possible, to fully establish stability and
normalcy in Liberia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of the chiefs of staff is expected to make its
recommendations to the ECOWAS summit scheduled for Thursday in
Lagos, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, observers doubted if ECOWAS's sanctions will
work.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS chiefs of staff were also expected to discuss a
framework on the restructuring and training of the armed forces
as well as the police and security agencies of Liberia by ECOWAS
peace-keeping forces in that country known as ECOMOG.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said today that the Palestinian leadership is taking
seriously reports that Israel plans to assassinate some leading
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza following his visit to Egypt,
Arafat described the alleged plan as a "very serious step" that
cannot help advancing the peace process, according to a report
of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nablus Mayor Ghassan Shak's was quoted in the
Israeli press as saying that he has evidence to prove the
existence of an Israeli assassination ring.
BDH296PAB208I26TEQL02:0402:052071
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Ariel
Sharon is planning to assassinate Arafat, PLO Secretary General
Abu Mazen and Social Welfare Minister Intisar Al-Wazir.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Arafat made public comments on the
reports. Arafat held talks in Alexandria, Egypt Monday with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the current
Israeli-Palestinian crisis. He called for convening an Arab
summit to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Minister of Higher Education and former
spokeswoman for the Palestinian peace delegation, first raised
the issue Saturday, warning against the dangerous consequences
should Israel carry out the assassination plan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have categorically denied the reports,
terming them a provocation causing a panic in the Palestinian
public.
</P>
<P>
But according to the U.S. TV network, CNN, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior advisor David Bar-Ilan
hinted Saturday that Israel might find an alternative as peace
partner instead of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that anybody, anyone, is indispensable. I
believe that our alternatives always exist," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> WFP Begins Emergency Airlift of Seeds to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) today began airlifting urgently-needed seeds to to
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to enable returned
refugees to plant in time.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here today said that a WFP chartered
C-130 aircraft landed this morning in Bukavu in the southern Kivu
area with 18 tons of seeds.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 280 tons of maize seed, bean seed and soya
seed will be delivered in 16 flights over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that the WFP is providing a one-month food
package to some 15,000 families receiving the seeds as part of a
"seed protection" program to discourage hungry families from
eating their seeds.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies operating in the area are supplying food and
seeds to tens of thousands of families who have recently returned
to their homes around Bukavu as they are unable to sow crops for
the next harvest due to arrive in January 1998, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been providing airlift support for the Great Lakes
emergency since October 1996 with WFP aircraft ferrying a total
of 8,346 tons of food into the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization has also participated in a massive
airlift refugee repatriation operation which began at the end of
April 1997 and to date it has flown some 50,000 refugees back to
Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn today warned that a delay in starting the single
European currency, the Euro, would mean the end of the project.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio today,
Strauss-Kahn said, "It must come on January 1, 1999. A delay would

</P>
<P>
Any delay was neither legally possible nor desirable, he added.
</P>
<P>
The French finance minister also stressed that France would
adhere to the conditions set by the EU for qualifying for the
single currency, including the one which requires a member state's
budget deficit to be less than 3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
France, whose current budget deficit stood at about 3.5 to 3.7
percent of GDP, would bring itself "quite close" to the 3-percent
target thanks to measures introduced by the government in July,
Strauss-Kahn said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Expected to Produce Less Wheat in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's wheat production is
expected to be the lowest in nine years, Statistics Canada
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Total wheat production has been adversely affected by 2.5
million fewer seeded acres this year and a reported yield decrease
of six bushels per acre," the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Wheat production is expected to drop by 6.8 million tons this
year, the largest drop since 1988 when production fell by 10
million tons," the agency said in its July 31 estimate.
</P>
<P>
Extremely dry conditions throughout July have taken their toll
on all crops in Canada's major producing provinces of Western
Canada, and farmers there are expecting much lower yields than
last year for all major crops.
</P>
<P>
Barley production is expected to fall by 2.0 million tons
compared with last year because of 0.5 million fewer seeded acres
and an expected reduced yield of six bushels per acre.
</P>
<P>
Of the major crops surveyed, only canola and flaxseed were
reported to show an increase in production.
</P>
<P>
Canola acreage rose by 3.4 million acres this year, but the
expected drop in yield of four bushels per acre will moderate the
rise in production to 1 million tons.

CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman International Bank has launched a public
issue of its equity shares aimed at increasing its capital as part
of efforts to strengthen its lending capacity, the Omani news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The issue of 6,074,602 shares, which is open exclusively for
Omani nationals and 100 Omani companies, is priced at 1.3
U.S. dollars per share. The issue will close for subscription on
September 21.
</P>
<P>
After the issue, the share capital of the bank will stand at
17.7 million dollars, making it the best capitalized Omani bank,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in capital will considerably enhance the bank's
lending capacity, it added.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian industry utilized no more than 53 percent of
its overall production capacity, semi-official Jordan Times
today quoted a study by the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The figure comes from the fact that the medium and small size
industries are now comparatively active while the large-size ones,
except the mining ones, are in a sluggish condition, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the low utilization rate to limited resource of
funds.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government earlier admitted that its economy was
in recess and is currently undergoing a restructure prescribed by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A Jordanian delegation led by Minister of Trade,
Industry and Supply Hani Moulki left here today for Damascus to
attend the annual Damascus International Fair scheduled for
Thursday, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's participation stemmed from its keenness to enhance
trade and economic ties with Syria, said delegation member Haidar
Murad, chairman of the Federation of Jordanian Chambers of
Commerce, in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 Jordanian industrial businesses will take part in
the fair, displaying samples of their products and introducing
their investment services.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade between the two countries is now in favor
of Syria, which sold Jordan 99 million Jordanian dinars (about 140
million U.S. dollars) worth of goods in 1996. Jordan exported 41
million dinars (about 58 million dollars) worth of goods to Syria
in the same year.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Despite strong opposition from local producers, Jordan
has decided to open its mineral water market to foreign
competitors in a bid to secure its entry to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Times newspaper reported today the Jordanian
government would allow for the import of mineral water from Arab
and other foreign countries from the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hani Moulki, minister of trade, industry and supply, was quoted
as saying the measure is aimed at pushing Jordanian companies to
improve mineral water production and their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Moulki made the remarks Monday while meeting with members of
the Amman Chamber of Industry (ACI), who object to the government
decision, claiming it will inflict heavy losses on the domestic
industry.
</P>
<P>
Costs of mineral water production in neighboring Arab countries
were far less than in Jordan, said an ACI spokesman who declined
to give his name. Therefore, Jordan's products would be vulnerable
in price competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian government decided to raise water
price by 150 percent, due to severe shortage of water resources,
which ACI said would further increase the costs of local mineral
water production like "spreading oil over troubled water."
</P>
<P>
Jordan has five mineral water factories, which have a total
capital of 4 million Jordanian dinars (about 5.6 million
U.S. dollars) and offer job opportunities to 1,500 people. There
is no official figure as to their annual profits.
</P>
<P>
Mineral water imports have been rare for years in the kingdom,
which is now making intensive efforts for WTO membership through
improving its market access to foreign goods.

</P>
<P>
But it was the South Korean combination who eventually won the
tie-breaker and the match.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Awaits Iran's Good-Will Gestures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said today that it was
waiting to see the new Iranian government to prove its good
intentions towards the Arab world including Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that the new Iranian administration demonstrate
its good will not only towards Iraq but also towards all Arab
countries," said Nabil Negm, Iraq's chief delegate to the
Cairo-based Arab League (AL).
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Negm as saying following
his meeting with Zakaria Azmi, AL assistant secretary general for
political affairs, that Iraq had displayed "genuine desire for
neighborly relations" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the Iranian court, and Tehran has to prove
its well intentions towards the Arabs and stop interfering in
their internal affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Negm said that to improve ties, Tehran should free the 20,000
Iraqi prisoners of war captured during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war
and return Iraqi aircraft sent to Iran in 1991 to escape attacks
by allied forces during the Gulf War over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein decided on August 18 to allow
from September 4 Iranian visits to Shiite Muslim shrines in Iraq,
which were banned since the two countries went to war in
1980. Nearly one million people were killed in the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, newly-elected Iranian President Mohammed Khatami
appealed to Baghdad to show "good-will" and release Iranian
prisoners of war he said Iraq was still holding.
</P>
<P>
A senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official on August 18 called
for the two countries to conclude a "peace accord" to settle all
the outstanding problems between them.
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the UN-brokered cease fire of August 18, 1988,
Iran and Iraq have never formally made peace.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's President in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
BDH301PAB222I26TEQL02:2802:304074
arrived in Liberia today to show support for newly-installed
President Charles Taylor and discuss with him matters to be
brought up at the ECOWAS summit scheduled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Liberians braved heavy downpour to meet Rawlings
in the capital Monrovia, singing and dancing, and carrying
colorful banners inscribed with words of welcome, the British
Broadcast Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after reaching the Executive Mansion, the site of
the government, the two leaders went straight to three-hour
talks behind closed door.
</P>
<P>
There is no word about what they have talked or what they
might have decided so far.
</P>
<P>
At a public meeting later, however, President Rawlings called
on Liberians to commit themselves to the task of rebuilding their
nation, saying that the trading of bullets must now be considered
over.
</P>
<P>
Provided Liberia has an exact understanding of where it comes
from, where it stands and where it is going, the international
community will come to its aid, said Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Taylor described Rawlings' visit as historic, which he said
would strengthen a new south-south relationship that will help
change the destiny of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he and Rawlings were among the new breed of
African leaders who are expected to take the continent to
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings' tour to Liberia followed his three-day official
visit to Cote d'Ivoire last week, which observers noted were
important diplomatic moves on th eve of the summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to be held
in Nigeria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian leader was the Chairman of ECOWAS in two
successive terms before Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha took the post last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
extended Monday's losses and ended down sharply, with Frankfurt
worst hit, undermined by the dollar's drop and worries about rise
in German interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The London market, which was closed Monday for a bank holiday,
ended lower but off weakest levels of the session. Dealers said
that futures and a weak performance on Wall Street added to the
negative sentiment, keeping the FTSE 100 index subdued below the
4,900-level.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained thin after the long weekend, and banking
stocks were down. The index ended down 14.8 points at 4,886.3.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt plunged by 2.8 percent after the
dollar tumbled below 1.80 marks and prospects for a near-term
German interest rate hike weighed on market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index was dragged below the key level of 4,000
points and was 112.46 points lower at 3,959.33 by the close of the
session.
</P>
<P>
Stocks on the Paris bourse were also lower as bonds turned
weaker. The CAC-40 index finished at 2,869, down 29.31 points.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President's Cairo Visit Aims to Appease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel's visit to Cairo scheduled on September 16 aims to allay
Arab apprehension about Ankara's growing military ties with
Israel, the Turkish ambassador to Egypt said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his
Turkish counterpart comes within the context of continued
consultation between the countries' leaderships, Yacar Yakis told
the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Yakis said that Demirel's one-day visit to Egypt will cover the
latest developments in the region and bilateral and regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"President Demirel's visit is aimed at dispelling fears of
Turkey's likely distancing itself from the Arab world and getting
closer to Israel," Yakis said, adding that relations between
Turkey and Israel are not of any dimensions causing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a military cooperation accord in
February 1996 and announced in May that they will stage joint
naval exercises in the eastern Mediterranean in this summer.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers provoked outcries from Arab countries,
especially Syria, which sees itself as the target of the
Turkish-Israeli alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Turkish summit, which was originally set for May,
was postponed in the wake of the planned naval war games.
</P>
<P>
There have been various reports on the possible postponement of
the maneuvers in view of the strong Arab protests, while Turkish
defense and foreign officials give contradictory replies and
answers to it.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said earlier that the Egyptian-Turkish
summit will focus on means to enhance relations between the two
countries and increase the volume of trade, the situation in
northern Iraq, as well as the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Laws Urged for Beira Corridor in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Transport and Energy
Minister Enos Chikowore today called for the establishment of the
Beira Development Corridor (BDC) through an appropriate legal
instrument.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a Joint Technical Unit (JTU)
meeting on BDC, Chikowore said the instrument would go a long way
in facilitating the integration of the economies affected by the
BDC through the promotion of common policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The current Beira corridor is a railway and road network
running between Zimbabwe's eastern border town of Mutare and
Mozambican port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
The BDC concept was consistent with the thrust of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and Southern African
Transport and Communication Commission (SATCC) of promoting
integrated, harmonized, efficient and cost effective transport
and telecommunication systems within the region, Chikowore noted.
</P>
<P>
The JTU was formed at the eighth annual meeting of ministers
of foreign affairs of Zimbabwe and Mozambique held in Mozambique
in August last year where the two countries agreed to deepen and
widen cooperation in the development of the Beira corridor which
provide the shortest outlet for Zimbabwe's export.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of transport set up a joint working group
consisting of technical experts and business representatives from
both countries with a mandate to advise on how the BDC could be
created, organized and promoted.
</P>
<P>
The joint working group was later expanded to include Malawi
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of establishing the BDC are clearly immense,"
Chikowore stressed, adding, "an appropriate legal instrument will
set out the principles and parameters to guide the various actors
involved in the transformation of the corridor."

<HEADLINE> Algerian Government Decries Terrorist Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government today
condemned the rampant terrorist acts in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Spokesman for the Algerian cabinet
Habib Shawki said such acts are "unhuman" as they "target the
civilians to undermine the morale of the people and defame
Algeria."
</P>
<P>
Shawki, who is also the cultural minister, said "invested with
the people's will and the resoluteness of its security men, the
Algerian government is capable of continuing its fight against
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Algeria is growing tense due to the escalating
terrorism with the approach of the local elections to be held on
October 23.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 people have been slain in terrorist acts since
the latest parliamentary elections last July.
</P>
<P>
The army canceled a parliamentary vote in January 1992, in
which the Muslim fundamentalists might win. Since then, the
Islamic insurgents have been fighting to overthrow the current
government.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Kurdish Group Denies Support of Outlawed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK), one of the main warring parties in northern
Iraq, today denied reports that the group supports the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PUK office in Ankara said in a statement that press
reports regarding this are incorrect and baseless, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The PUK statement came amidst recent reports from various
press organizations that the PUK and the PKK are joining hands
in the fighting against the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP),
the main rival of the PUK in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDP led by Massoud Barzani accused the PUK of cooperating
with the PKK rebels stationed in the region last weekend, saying
that their cooperation has reached an alarming level.
</P>
<P>
The PUK statement said that the PUK led by Jalal Talabani
still abides by the cease-fire agreement in spite of "a KDP
provocation."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the clashes between the PKK and PUK took place
far away from the ceas-fire line, the statement said that the KDP
uses this allegation as an excuse because it could not fulfill
its promise to Turkey that it will eradicate the PKK in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the PUK attached importance to the
invitation of Turkey, the United States and Britain to bring
it and the KDP to Washington for talks in a bid to revive the
sluggish Ankara peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara peace process started after the three countries
convinced the KDP and PUK to end a bloody conflict in northern
Iraq late last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry has reportedly conveyed its complaint
to the PUK about the activities of the PKK in the PUK-controlled
areas, warning that this is unacceptable to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey launched a massive cross-border military campaign in
mid-May this year in a bid to wipe out the outlawed PKK rebels
there, triggering strong criticism from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been controlled by the two
Kurdish groups since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into
rival zones after the KDP and PUK began fighting each other in
1994.

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 312 million people live

However, the report, entitled "India: Achievements and

percent growth rates of the last three years are sustained, and
income distribution remains at its present levels, poverty could
plummet from its current rate of 35 percent to 6.3 percent by
2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in the early 1950s, nearly half of the
country's population was living in poverty. Since then, poverty
has declined, but at a slow rate than other Asian countries.
Today, roughly one-third of the population is poor by the same
standards as the early 1950s. However, due to rapid population
growth, even these modest rates of poverty reduction have not been
sufficient to reduce the numbers of poor people, which have risen
from about 164 million in 1951 to 312 million in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said India is home to the largest
concentration of poor people of any single country in the world.
This is especially true in the rural areas, where nearly three out
of four Indians and 77 percent of Indian live poor.
</P>
<P>
Extending the definition of poverty to include other indicators
of well-being such as health and education, the report showed
India has made substantial gains in poverty reduction over the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, India has not yet achieved the
momentum needed to lift the great majority of its poor into the
economic mainstream. Infant mortality rates, as one example, fell
from 146 deaths per thousand births in the 1950s to 80 at the
start of the 1990s. Yet the rate is still one of the highest in
the world today. Life expectancy in India is 60 years and well
below that of China, 69 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Villagers Protest Use of Cyanide in Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Around 250 Turkish villagers
occupied the Bosporus Bridge linking Asia and Europe in Istanbul
for one and a half hours today to protest cyanide use in gold
processing.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, who traveled some 560 kilometers from the
western town of Bergama, staged a sit-down demonstration on the
bridge to express their opposition against the using of cyanide in
a gold mine in Bergama.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried banners saying "No to cyanide use
untile we die," and they left the bridge peacefully after warnings
by police.
</P>
<P>
Eurogold, a company owned by France, Australia and Canada, has
been said to use cyanide in the gold processing in the gold mines
in Bergama.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers feared that the cyanide will damage the
environment of the historic town, where the ancient relics attract
thousands of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The company experts, however, stated that the villages have
been misled by the environmentalists and the method of using
cyanide to process gold is safe.
</P>
<P>
A Bergama court is reportedly reviewing the application from
the protesters calling for a ban on the possible use of cyanide
in the gold mine.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Block PKK Bases in Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police chief said
today that the Turkish troops and police will prevent the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) from establishing new bases
in Turkey's Black Sea region
</P>
<P>
Necati Bilican, General Director of Police Forces of Turkey,
made the remarks in a meeting with a visiting senior police
delegation from Moldova, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bilican said that the PKK rebels had long been locked in
eastern and southeastern Turkey and they now wanted to expand
their activities to the Black Sea region.
</P>
<P>
"We have organized groups in the Black Sea region who have
had special training in combating terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security troops have been fighting the PKK since
the Kurdish armed group start their independent movement in
1984.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has increased its cooperation with neighboring
countries like Iran, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia as well as Russia
in order to prevent the PKK from receiving outside support,
according to Bilican.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ismet Sezgin said last
weekend that the government will lift the 10-year-old emergency
rule in southeastern Turkey by early next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that this move was made because the task of fighting
the PKK has been basically completed and there is no need to
keep the emergency rule in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has long been termed as the most dangerous threat to
the border security of southeastern Turkey, leading to a massive
cross-border military operation by the Turkish troops in
northern Iraq in mid-May this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 people, including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since the PKK
started a separatist war in order to establish an independent
Kurdish state.

CATANIA, Sicily, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and hosts Italy
are in the finals of Universiade soccer tournament after beating their
respective rivals in the semi-finals on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean team forced their Ukrainian opponents into penalty
shoot-out after the match ended without a single goal from either
side.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans showed their expertise in penalty kick and missed
none of their first five tries.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian team were not that lucky as they missed two and bowed
out of the contention.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final match between the United States and Italy,
Italy rolled over the American team with the least margin.
</P>
<P>
The match was exciting and full of action. The Italians gained an
upper hand in the first half but could not find the net with their
shots.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock continued until the 64th minute in the second half
when Italian forward was fouled down and the referee awarded a penalty
to the host team.
</P>
<P>
Gianni Califano made no mistakes in converting the kick from the
spot. After taking the 1-0 lead, the Italian eleven concentrated on
defence and gave their American opponents the domination of the match.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Americans could find no way of beating the Italian defence
while at the same time, were nearly caught off-handed by several
Italian quick counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
The score remained unchanged till the final whistle and sent the
host team into the final.
</P>
<P>
The final between South Korea and Italy will be played on August
31, the closing day of the 19th World University Games.

<HEADLINE> Coordinator for Iraqi Aid: "Oil-For-Food" Plan a </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Staffan de Mistura, the
outgoing coordinator for Iraqi aid in Baghdad, said today the "oil
for food" plan was a success despite early delays.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to formally present his
successor Denis Halliday, De Mistura said, "A total of 1.3 million
tons of food and medicines which have arrived inside Iraq have,
according to all indications we have, reached the ordinary Iraqis
affected by sanctions."
</P>
<P>
De Mistura said that the 142 U.N. observers inside Iraq have
been able to move freely without major impediment, keeping tabs on
some 53,000 retail centers and ensuring equal distribution to the
Iraqis and Kurdish population in the northern reaches of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been some disagreements with the Iraqi
government. "But we were able to solve them, perhaps by discussing
in a firm and fair way on both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator said the full allotment of food and medicine
purchased from the first 2 billion U.S. dollars, which ran from
December to June, would continue arriving through the middle of
November.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed since last year to sell oil under the
"oil-for-food" plan, mainly to buy food and medicine for its
people suffering under sanctions imposed by the U.N. in 1990 after
it invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the plan, which allows Iraq to sell another
2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil, will run from June to
December.

<HEADLINE> Lasting Peace Still Distance Away in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite peace initiatives
with the Somali warlords in and outside the country through both
local and foreign diplomatic channels, a lasting peace for the
war-ravaged country is still some distance away.
</P>
<P>
However, after seven years of anarchy and lawlessness,
traditional leaders, sultans and Imams from eleven regions have
met in south Mogadishu with the intention of peace mediating
among the various Somali clans.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 traditional delegates representing 14 clans and
sub-clans have concluded a 30-day meeting here in the Somali
capital. The elders have made an appeal to all the Somalis to
reconcile and settle their disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Ugas Abdullahi Ugas Farah, one of the central Galgudud region
traditional leaders, has called the leaders of the social groups
for a conference aimed at discussing the current situation of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ugas Farah who did not mention a venue for such a conference
said, his clan is ready to invest any such conference if the
Somali traditional leaders agree upon its convening and venue.
</P>
<P>
An appeal made by the elders has condemned what they called
the deliberate attacks and territorial violations by the
Ethiopian government against the Somalis and called on the
Ethiopian troops to pull out of Gedo region unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Addis said they entered the area in hot pursuit of Islamic
fundamentalists who allegedly crossed over to attack Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
The elders also called for international relief agencies to
help displaced refugees caused by the Ethiopian "invasion" in
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Hirab community traditional leaders at Ramadan hotel also
made an appeal particularly to the people in Benadir region of
Mogadishu to stop the widespread looting and kidnaping in the
streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, the north Mogadishu authorities have
announced a new peace campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jafar Sheikh Mohamud Mohamed, Attorney General of the north
Mogadishu Islamic courts, said all the Islamic courts militiamen
will be involved in the new peace efforts in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed called on the people to collaborate with the Islamic
militiamen for the common good of the Somalis. The north
Mogadishu Islamic courts have been dormant ever since Sheikh Ali
Sheikh Mohamud was sacked from the post of the chairmanship in a
decree issued by Ali Mahdi Mohamed in October last year. Sheikh
Ali was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
These new peace tentative among the Somalis are taking place
amid new speculations on whether an anticipated reconciliation
conference in the northeastern region of Bossaso in November this
year will take place.
</P>
<P>
People believe that there will be no real settlement unless a
concrete agreement is reached among all factions in Mogadishu.

JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican police have
dismantled a large amount of arms in a suburb of Chimoio, capital
of the central province of Manica, according to a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The weapons, which included 548 mortar shells, 784 rockets, 78
grenades and eight dynamite charges, were destroyed on August 12,
the independent Mediafax said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The police also found a smaller cache consisting of five
rifles and one rocket launcher at another site in Manica, said
Mediafax.
</P>
<P>
Manica was a stronghold of the former rebel Renamo movement
during 17 years of civil war, which ended with a peace accord
signed in Italy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Another batch of substantial arms was found in the northern
province of Niassa, which included one piece of anti-aircraft
artillery, 222 pieces of shells, 32 land mines and a variety of
ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for UN's Help to Approve Food Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urged the
U.N. Sanctions Committee to persuade the United States and Britain
to approve the deals that Iraq has signed with foreign countries
under the first stage of oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the chairman of the sanctions committee, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf said that despite the
elapse of more than two months since the end of the first phase of
the deal, more than 60 contracts which were signed in the first
phase, are still frozen, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
These contracts even haven't reached to the members of the
committee, Al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the committee to take necessary measures to accelerate
the implementation of the contracts as Iraq has already started
concluding deals on the purchase of foodstuffs and medicines under
the second phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, which was signed in May last year and
went into effect last December, allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months for badly needed food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council renewed the deal on June 8 for
another six months, allowing Iraq to sell another 2 billion
dollars of oil.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has always been accusing the United States and Britain,
which are members of the committee, of blocking the implementation
of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The contracts signed between Iraq and other countries must be
anonymously approved by the members of the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the INA reported that Al-Sahhaf sent messages to the
foreign ministers of the states whose deals with Iraq were blocked
by Britain or the U.S. in the first phase of the deal.
</P>
<P>
As-Sahhaf appealed to the foreign ministers of these states to
contact Washington and London and urge them to lift their
suspension of the deals.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to make greater efforts to end this abnormal
situation and serve the interests of their countries in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs Seizes Smuggling Cargo Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Local customs agents in
Shanghai, China's largest metropolitan area, recently seized a
cargo ship in the process of offloading smuggled cigarettes,
according to an announcement released here today.
</P>
<P>
The local customs investigation bureau reported that ship was
carrying 14 40-foot containers holding 13,000 cases of
cigarettes. Most of the crew fled before the ship was seized by
local customs.
</P>
<P>
Experts point to the fact that smugglers loaded their cargo
abroad and brazenly attempted to evade local customs agents.
</P>
<P>
The announcement made by the local customs investigation bureau
said that the seizing of the smuggling cargo ship indicated that a
cigarettes-smuggling shipping line, which had already operated for
more than a year, was destroyed.

<HEADLINE> First Land Auction Since Handover Nets HK$ 5.67 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The first land auction in Hong
Kong since the handover brought in 5.67 billion HK dollars
(727 million US dollars) to the coffins of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government today.
</P>
<P>
Three government lots, all designated for private residential
use, were put up for auction this afternoon, with the largest site
in Repulse Bay sold for 5.55 billion HK dollars (712 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Located in the south coast of the Hong Kong Island and
commanding a good view of the Repulse Bay, the 10,570 square meter
plot was finally sold to Gain Regent Development Limited after a
string of keen bidding among property developers opened at 3
billion HK dollars (385 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Property analysts predicted that with a plot ratio of three,
the Repulse Bay site could offer up to 31,710 square meters of
gross floor area.
</P>
<P>
Two other small low-density residential sites were also
auctioned off today, one in Lamma Island for 64 million HK dollars
(8 million US dollars) and the other in Sha Tin for 56 million HK
dollars (7 million US dollars). The two plots have a total area
of nearly 5,200 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Today's land auction was the start of a series of government
land sales over the next few years. Last month, the SAR government
announced a five-year land sales program, which would release
about 378 hectares of residential land.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa was determined to provide 85,000
residential units each year, in an effort to solve the widely
concerned housing problem.
</P>
<P>
Acting Financial Secretary Kwong Ki Chi said today: "Between
now and March 1999, we will be putting out another 31 sites
totaling 63 hectares of low-density residential land to meet the
market demand."
</P>
<P>
"We should not read too much into the results of a single
auction," he responded to media inquires on the outcome of the
first land sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization Department of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee recently issued a
set of regulations governing the behavior of officials in charge
of organizational and personnel work.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, including six chapters and 27 articles,
stipulate that officials in charge of organizational and personnel
affairs should pay strict attention to theory study and politics
and uphold justice.
</P>
<P>
Such officials should diligently study Marxism-Leninism-Mao
Zedong Thought, and particularly Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the regulations
said.
</P>
<P>
They should cultivate their firm belief in communism and
socialism and implant the Marxist world outlook on life and
values, it added.
</P>
<P>
They should conscientiously remain in step with the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, and resolutely implement
the Party's basic line, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations call on the officials to exhibit their full
loyalty to the cause of the Party and the people, and to strictly
adhere to the Party's principles and policies governing
organizational and personnel work.
</P>
<P>
They should fairly handle public affairs and strictly abide by
the state laws and rules, and should serve the people with heart
and soul, and seek truth from facts, the regulations said.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also stipulate that such officials should
remain open-minded and steadfastly resist various temptations.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Avdeiev has called on Nordic nations to stay
away from NATO, saying that bloc's expansion would have
detrimental effects on the region.
</P>
<P>
Avdeiev made these remarks Tuesday at the Nordic Council's
security policy conference in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the security policy balance in the Nordic region
had to be retained and it was important for Sweden, Finland and
the Baltic states to remain outside military blocs.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Baltic states refrain from becoming NATO members,
Russia would not reconsider its cooperation with NATO and those
countries applying for NATO membership, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Sweden and Finland, too, should remain
militarily non-aligned.
</P>
<P>
But his views were rejected by a number of Baltic and Nordic
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Jan Eliasson, Swedish Under Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, said that Sweden should remain outside NATO, but insisted
that "we define our security policy requirements ourselves".

<HEADLINE> Oldest Woman Discovered in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Le Thi Co, a 117-year-old
Vietnamese woman living in suburb of Ho Chi Minh city, is believed
to be the oldest woman in the world, Vietnam news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Co may break the record held by a 116-year-old Canadian woman
who was recognized by the Guinness world records, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Co's identity card issued in 1961 showed that she was born in
1880 in Plong, a province in southern Vietnam. Now she lives in
Hoc Mon district of Ho Chi Minh city.
</P>
<P>
She has about 500 living relatives, spreading over five
generations, said Pham Van Lo, Co's 10th son who is 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
Co, who had 14 children, lost her husband in 1960. Her oldest
child died two years ago at the age of 82. Her youngest child is
now 59.
</P>
<P>
Co's father lived 99 years and her youngest sister is 95 now.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Co cannot move out of her house because of pain
caused by a fall but her eyes and ears are in good condition. With
a good memory, she can remember her wedding party and the groom's
wedding gifts.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was beautiful when she was young, Co said, "Just
normal, like other girls."
</P>
<P>
She said her children and grand-children usually give her
money.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't take much because I'm old and they are young. They
need money more than I do," she explained.
</P>
<P>
Co said the key to her longevity was manual labor and a
moderate diet.

BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank, the

mid-June to stem the steep decline of the German mark on money
markets, said German economists today.
</P>
<P>
The market interventions, combined with threats from senior
central bankers to raise interest rates, had helped to lower the
dollar value from its peak of 1.8873 marks registered on August 6
to the current levels of around 1.80 marks, said the economists at
Germany's largest commercial bank, the Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Further Raises Banks' Liquidity Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank today
raised anew the liquidity reserves requirement for banks from 5
percent to 8 percent in order to stabilize the exchange rate
between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to siphon off more than 30 billion pesos
(1 billion U.S. dollars) in excess liquidity from the monetary
system, local television reports quoted officials at the Central
Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, meanwhile, announced a one-percentage-point
increase in banks' legal stationary reserves from 13 percent to 14
percent effective today.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity reserves are the deposits which should be
invested in short-term government securities issued by the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Banks are also required to keep some of its deposits just in
vaults or deposit them with the Central Bank with a very low
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The measures to raise both the two kinds of bank reserves came
after the peso suffered a new round of speculative attacks these
days.
</P>
<P>
The peso, which began to jitter again last week, today
depreciated sharply to the dollar at the local currency market,
with its average exchange rate against the dollar plunging to
30.234 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
This latest exchange rate was the lowest since the currency's
de facto depreciation allowed by the Central Bank on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank today also was forced to intervene in the
currency market for the first time in two weeks, selling about 10
million dollars at a rate of 30.05 pesos to one dollar.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Continued Peace Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace efforts
must continue despite the failure of talks facilitated by
Tanzania's former president J. Nyerere and scheduled for August 25
in Arusha, northern Tanzanian, the OAU chief has said.
</P>
<P>
Salim A. Salim, secretary general of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), made the appeal in an interview with local
press in Arusha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was unfortunate that the Burundian government
delegation boycotted the meeting but it is still his hope that
"negotiations must go on and there is need for further
consultations to determine the way forward."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the failed talks, Salim stressed there is no
alternative to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I think the conditions for peace talks were fair, but the
Burundian government feels differently. I think that we'll have
to listen also to what they think is the way forward," Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that the OAU will continue to consult to bring back
Major Pierre Buyoya's military government of Burundi into the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The OAU will try to overcome bottlenecks that exist now in the
peace talks, said Salim, adding that "all of us can only help to
start talks. No one can impose on the people of Burundi...It's
only the Burundians who can decide on their destiny."
</P>
<P>
The scheduled all-party talks on Burundi aborted after Major
Buyoya's military government refused to take part in the talks on
alleged grounds that they were insecure in Tanzania and that the
peace facilitator Nyerere was partially favoring the Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, however, dismissed the allegations, saying that he
has been making sincere efforts to bring peace to the war-torn
central African country.

It marked the first time that blood-test was conducted at a

riders this year at the European competitions.
</P>

UCI is attempting to employ blood-test to crack down the use of
Erythropoietin (EPO) among cyclists, which could increase the
number of red blood cells and therefore boost endurance.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Iran's Liberal Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
declarations by the Iranian government on the increase of public
liberties and the opening of the country to other cultures.
</P>
<P>
"The declarations of President Mohammad Khatami and his
ministers concerning public liberties and cultural opening are in
favor of a positive evolution of relations between Iran the
international community," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) nations withdrew their ambassadors from
Tehran in April after a German court linked Iranian leadership to
the assassination of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin
restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
There have been renewed hopes among EU countries for improved
ties with Tehran after Iran's new president, Mohammad Khatami,
took office on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Iran expressed interest in improving relations with
EU countries, but said that Germany would be the last Tehran wants
to contact with.
</P>
<P>
However, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Tuesday that
he was in favor of resuming contact with the more liberal new
government in Tehran.

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A group calling itself "We Who

powerful explosion at a stadium in the western Swedish port of
Gothenburg on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group warned the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that
if it chose Stockholm next month as the host venue for the 2004
Olympic Games, Sweden should prepare for a campaign of guerrilla
warfare.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will decide the venue of the 2004 Games on September
5. Athens, Rome, Cape Town and Buenos Aires are the other cities
in the frame.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves Decline Sharply in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign-exchange
reserves are expected to fall below the 30 billion U.S. dollar
mark next month, raising fears that the country may face a serious
foreign-exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a tally released by the Bank of Korea (BOK), the
nation's foreign-exchange holdings fell from 33.7 billion
U.S. dollars to 31.5 billion dollars today.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommends that a
country's foreign-exchange holdings remain equivalent to the value
of its imports for three months.
</P>
<P>
Considering this, experts say, South Korea's present holdings
fall below that internationally-recognized optimum level with the
country's reserves being now of a value equivalent to imports of a
mere 2.6 months.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline was mainly due to the central bank's active
intervention to curb the falling won-dollar rates, and its
extension of emergency foreign currency-denominated loans to
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had to extend 1.2 billion dollars as special
loans to protect banks' external credit standing, and sell 800
million dollars to stablize the foreign-exchange market during the
turmoil of depreciation of won.
</P>
<P>
The won-dollar exchange rate, which fell rapidly from 840 level
by the end of last year to 897.50 on August 18 and 904.60 today,
is feared to drop further.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank plans to extend more than 1
billion dollars in foreign currency-denominated loans to domestic
financial institutions next month when Japanese financiers usually
withdraw their loans extended to Korean banks to settle their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that the government should immediately
employ appropriate measures to secure sufficient foreign-exchange
holdings.

KINSHASA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Former President of the Congo
Republic Denis Sassou Nguesso said today his successor Pascal
Lissouba hired foreign mercenaries in air aid on his home
districts.
</P>
<P>
"Russian or Croatian mercenaries flew from Pointe-Noire these
helicopters which sowed desolation in the districts of northern
Brazzaville and in the populated areas. This is a real genocide,
to say the least," said Sassou Nguesso in an interview with Radio

</P>
<P>
Four Russian-made MI-18 and MI-24 Combat helicopters pounded
Sassou Nguesso's Mpila home district in the capital of Brazzaville
early on Tuesday. It was the first time helicopters joined the

Agence France-Presse reported that the helicopters also bombed
the streets around Tower Nabemba, a 30-story skyscraper belonging

</P>
<P>
France, the Central African country's former colonial power,

Fighting began on June 5 after Lissouba tried to disarm his
rival Sassou Nguesso ahead of a now postponed elections.

<HEADLINE> Lions Club Donates to Blind Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.75 million blind
Chinese may once again see the light of day due to a treatment
program sponsored by Lions Clubs International and the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) granted 15.3
million US dollars today to fund operations for 1.75 million
people suffering from cataracts, the establishment of ophthalmic
clinics in 100 Chinese county-level hospitals, and the training of
4,000 ophthalmologists in cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
The foundation made the donation as part of the program known
as "SightFirst China Action".
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled Persons Federation,
and Howard Patterson Jr., president of Lions Clubs International,
signed the agreement in the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
According to State Councillor Peng Peiyun, who also attended
the signing ceremony, "The program will help restore eyesight to a
large number of blind Chinese."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it will greatly enhance the surgical skills
of Chinese ophthalmologists," said Peng, who is also Chairperson
of the State Council Coordinating Committee on Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
China is home to more than nine million blind people, nearly
half of whom are suffering from cataracts. Chinese ophthalmologists
have completed an untold number of cataract operations since
1988. However, limited economic conditions and medical facilities
in rural China cannot control the increase of cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
"SightFirst China Action" will help China correct treatable
cases of blindness over the next five years, and will give the
gift of sight to more than 1.75 million Chinese, particularly in
the country's poorest rural regions.
</P>
<P>
Lions Clubs International, established in 1917, is the world's
largest humanitarian service organization. The foundation has
carried its worldwide "SightFirst" program for the past six years,
including the largest donation in China this time.
</P>
<P>
According to Patterson, "Lions Clubs builds bridges of
understanding between themselves and people around the world by
funding humanitarian projects."
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress; He Luli, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference; and Chinese Minister of Health Chen Minzhang also
attended the ceremony.

"It is not an issue for today, to put it mildly," Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said at a press conference after
meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Gennady Udovenko.
</P>
<P>
"It will make the resolution of many issues considerably
easier," Primakov said, adding that both sides attach great
importance to bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov and Udovenko did sign a statement on the
legal aspects of the border issue, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko arrived here Tuesday evening and is expected to leave
here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said determination of the border on the map is under
way following direct orders from Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
On a separate issue, Primakov reiterated Moscow's "negative
reaction" to the multinational navy exercise code-named Sea
Breeze '97 currently being held in the vicinity of the Crimean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He said according to the initial scenario, turmoil began in a
country due to assistance to separatist forces granted by a
neighboring country, but the scenario was hurriedly changed to
include an earthquake after Russia told Americans it was
absolutely unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Moscow does not like the new scenario either, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two ministers also discussed bilateral
trade and economic cooperation, a top priority in their
relations.

<HEADLINE> China's Population Growth Remains Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Population growth in China
remained slow in the five years since the 14th national congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) reports that the population
on the mainland was 1,223.89 million at the end of 1996, and the
birth rate and population growth rate had dropped to 16.98 per
thousand and 10.42 per thousand, respectively, the lowest since
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB, average population growth was 10.95 per
thousand over the past five years, with the population increasing
by 13.05 million annually.
</P>
<P>
China hit a peak around 1990, and population growth in coming
years should be lower. That peak was the third since 1949.
</P>
<P>
The SSB said that, in the past five years, the education level
in China improved thanks to increased spending on cultural
development and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
For every 100,000 people, there were 2,040 college grads and
28,796 junior middle school grads by the end of 1996, compared
with 1,422 and 23,344 in 1990, up 43.46 percent and 23.36 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990-1996 period, the number of people with secondary
middle school and primary school educations increased 7.18 percent
and 1.95 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number of dropouts declined a great deal. There
were 18.36 million children aged 6 to 14 who left school before
completing nine years of the compulsory education, a decrease of
44 percent from the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, 18.62 percent of the 6- to 14-year-olds were unable to
attend class, and that dropped to 8.83 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There were 145.43 million illiterates above the age of 15 in
1995, a decrease of 36.18 million from the 1990 figure.

<HEADLINE> Growth in Domestic Credit Slows Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The growth in net domestic credit
in the Philippines slowed down by nearly 10 percentage points
during the first four months this year compared with the same
period last year, the Philippine Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Fidel Ramos, the bank said net
domestic credit to both the public and private sectors reached
nearly 1.54 trillion pesos (51.5 billion U.S. dollars) during the
first four months this year, posting a 24.3 percent rise from the
year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
But this latest growth figure showed a sharp decline from the
34.2 percent recorded in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The private sector continued to get the bulk of loans,
accounting for 78.7 percent, extended by the country's monetary
system during the period.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year growth of private sector credit, however,
declined to 36.8 percent by the end of April, after peaking at 56
percent in August last year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, credits for the private sector reached 1.21
trillion pesos (40.5 billion dollars), coming mainly from
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector continued to be the main recipient of
the domestic credit for the period under review, accounting for
29.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Cambodian King in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China sincerely hopes that all
parties of Cambodia, under the leadership of King Norodom
Sihanouk, will properly settle their differences and make joint
efforts to ensure peace and development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made the remarks here today during a meeting
with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath
Sihanouk, who are scheduled to leave Beijing for home in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Qiao conveyed the regards and best wishes of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to King Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
He cited Sihanouk as being the most respected leader of the
Cambodian people and as an old friend of China who has made an
outstanding and important contribution to the development of
traditional Sino-Cambodian friendship.
</P>
<P>
China cherishes friendship with Sihanouk and attaches great
importance to good-neighborly relations with Cambodia, said Qiao,
adding that China hopes to further strengthen ties with Cambodia
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk expressed his gratitude for the unselfish and generous
aid China has provided to Cambodia, as well as for the highly
professional and intense care he has received from the Chinese
government and Chinese medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he will spend the remainder of his life to
contribute to the Cambodian people and to friendship between
Cambodia and China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao welcomed Sihanouk to return to China at any time for
medical treatment and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk pointed to recent internal problems in his country and
said that as the founder of the country he has remained neutral
and aloof, while at the same time extending great efforts to bring
about a peaceful solution of various issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sincere gratitude for China's understanding of
internal affairs in Cambodia and its support for national
reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk and Queen Monineath arrived in Beijing at the end
of February for routine medical examinations.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Leader Calls for Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The leader of India's Congress
party, the country's second largest party, today called for
launching a war against population explosion in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a special session of the Parliament which began on Tuesday,
Congress leader Sharad Pawar said that although the country had
made tremendous progress in various fields in the past 50 years
since independence in 1947, a large number of people still live
below poverty line mainly due to the country's unchecked
population growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the fast-growing population was the most important
problem facing the country. If immediate measures were not taken,
population of the country would cross the 1 billion mark in
another three-four years by the turn of the century, he warned.
</P>
<P>
India now has a population of 900 million, making it the second
most populous country in the world after China. Birth rate in
India is about 2.9 percent, one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
There was an urgent need to create awareness about the adverse
effect of fast population growth and make concerted efforts to
deal with the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unbridled increase in the number of people has eaten up the
fruits of development in the country," he added.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Pulls Out of U.N. Rights Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has pulled out of a U.N. human rights treaty,
saying it has abused the "sovereignty and dignity of the socialist
and third world countries", a DPRK official said today.
</P>
<P>
Han Chang-on, DPRK's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations in Geneva, told a news conference that his
government was quitting the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
DPRK was accused of human rights violations in a resolution
passed last Friday by a U.N. human rights sub-commission. Members
drafting the resolution were from France, Norway, Greece, the
United States, Belgium and Columbia. The sub-commission is an
expert body.
</P>
<P>
Han criticized the United States and other western forces for
"groundlessly selecting and attacking those countries that are not
obedient to them and do not follow their political mode, and on
the contrary, they ignore or cover with the so-called 'democratic
umbrella' the grave human rights violations in their own countries
and their allies".
</P>
<P>
Han said Pyongyang sent a letter of withdrawal to the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan on August 25. It joined the
rights treaty in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He also said the DPRK delegation will not attend the 16th
session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
"Our government will not, in the future, either, tolerate any
attempts to impair our sovereignty and stifle our socialist
system, under the pretext of 'protection of human rights', and
will take further resolute counter-measures to those attempts,"
said the DPRK official.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Seeks Direct Inter-Korean Air Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government is
stepping-up its efforts to conclude an agreement with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on opening direct
inter-Korean air routes, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Seoul has been trying to sign the pact as
soon as possible because its national flag carriers will be able
to benefit from the accord by saving considerable time and costs.
</P>
<P>
"We want to resume the talks about establishing direct
inter-Korean air routes at an earliest possible date," Kim
Kwang-jae, a director of the Ministry of Construction and
Transportation said today.
</P>
<P>
The next round of meeting will likely be held next month, he
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the DPRK, which have banned each other's
national flag carriers from passing through their skies since the
nation was divided in 1945, have been holding meetings under the
mediation of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
since last September.
</P>
<P>
At previous meetings, the two sides agreed in principle to open
their flight information regions (FIRs) to each other, but failed
to reach a final conclusion as the talks ran into a deadlock over
the establishment of a direct network for the communication of
flight information.
</P>
<P>
At present, South Korean airplanes flying the Seoul-North
American, Seoul-Khabarovsk as well as Seoul-Vladiostok routes have
to detour the DPRK's FIR, thus flying an unnecessarily longer
route.

<HEADLINE> Australia Seeks Japan's Support on Greenhouse Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia today sought Japan's
support for its position on climate change, arguing it would be in
both countries' economic interests to oppose binding greenhouse
gas emission targets for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made today by Australian Primary Industries and
Energy Minister John Anderson while addressing the Australia-Japan
Symposium in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
In the lead-up to December's global greenhouse gas conference
in Kyoto, Japan, Anderson said it was in both Japan's and
Australia's interests to stand firm against global pressure and
oppose binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
Anderson tried to persuade Japan by saying that "Over the next
decade, Australia should emerge as easily the biggest supplier of
primary energy to Japan."
</P>
<P>
He said Australia was set to meet a massive increase in
Japanese demand for resources, particularly energy. Australia so
far remains Japan's major energy supplier, exporting more than
half of the coal Japan imports annually.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said Australia could potentially sell an additional
740 million U.S. dollars of steaming coal a year to Japan, and an
extra 1.11 billion U.S. dollars of liquefied natural gas in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
But Japan appears to be unlikely to support Australia. During
his visit earlier this year to Australia, Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto disappointed his Australian counterpart John
Howard by declining to express Japan's support over Australia's
greenhouse gas stands.
</P>
<P>
Australia remains isolated on the issue and has failed to win
support from the United State and the European Union (EU) despite
great lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
The EU wants all developed countries to reduce their greenhouse
gas emissions by 15 percent of their 1990 level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Australia argues that as the world's leading coal exporter,
dependent on greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, it stands to
lose more than other countries if it adopted the EU proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in the Philippines
remained unchanged at 4.8 percent in July as compared with the
same month last year, the Philippine Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, the inflation rate rose by only 0.1
percent in July, representing a slowdown in the rise compared with
a 1.3-percent increase in June, according to figures released by
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate for the first seven months stood at
4.7 percent, well below the whole-year target of 6 to 7 percent
under the economic program supported by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Among the commodities, the prices of food, beverage and
tobacco, fuel, light and water registered lower rates in July.
</P>
<P>
Because of the favorable trend in price movements, the Central
Bank said, the operating targets for base money (BM) and reserve
money (RM) continued to be below the targeted ceilings set by the
IMF.

<HEADLINE> China Expanding Labor Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's rapid economic growth
has offered greater job opportunities, promoted the
market-oriented distribution of labor resources and provided
wide-ranging options for both employers and job-hunters.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP has grown by 77 percent over the past five years. A
rapidly expanding economic scale has contributed to higher
employment figures, according to a recent State Statistical Bureau
report.
</P>
<P>
China had more than 680 million employees by the end of last
year, up 6.3 percent from 1991. Some 30 million jobs were added in
urban areas due to the fact that governments and society as a
whole paid special attention to employment.
</P>
<P>
People have abandoned the formerly common practice of relying
on government for job assignments, and are instead attempting to
find employment on their own. Graduates, former soliders and
redundant workers have turned to the market for jobs.
</P>
<P>
While the government's role in the effort has weakened
somewhat, it is nonetheless actively drafting policies and
providing services to cultivate and promote labor market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, job placement services have mushroomed over the
past five years with 31,000 related agencies in place at the end
of 1996. The various agencies offered job opportunities for 8.9
million people last year alone, in addition to offering various
training programs for almost another four million people.
</P>
<P>
The competing systems of multiple choice and free transfers in
employment have enabled employers to select superior workers for
their labor forces, while employees now have the freedom to seek
higher paying positions.

</P>
<P>
In addition, the universally accepted labor contract system has
 further defined the rights and interests of employers and
workers, and in turn has helped form a healthy labor market.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 million employees were working under contract at the
end of last year, up 184 percent on the 1991 level. The former
figure accounted for slightly over half the total of employees in
the country, while the ratio approached 70 percent in state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that one outstanding characteristic of China's
labor market development lies in the private sector. Some 37
million laborers have found employment with private businesses
since 1991, a figure equivalent to 91.2 percent of the national
total increase in the number of employees.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has gained increasing importance as an
employment source for the large number of workers declared
redundant by state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China's registered unemployment rate for 1996 was three
percent, up 0.7 percentage points on 1991. The report concluded
that employment pressures will become even more tense as
enterprise continue to adopt reform measures for trimming payrolls
and improving efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Set to Join Talks on Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein is expected to be
invited to join all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
this week after security chiefs confirmed that the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) had maintained its ceasefire for nearly six
weeks, The Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation is expected to be confirmed on Thursday when
Marjorie Mowlam, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, meets
Prime Minister Tony Blair at Downing Street to brief him on the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political arm of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Blair will embark on a new round of meetings with leaders of
Northern Ireland's main political parties ahead of the talks'
resumption next month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said at the time of the latest ceasefire, on July 20,
that if it was not breached for six weeks Sinn Fein would be
invited to join the negotiations that start on Sept 15.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement could take place on Thursday after the
Downing Street meeting - four days before the formal end of the
six-week period - for "administrative reasons".

<HEADLINE> Unusual Ways of Burial Found in Ancient Kingdom Site in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A baby buried in an alcove of a
cave and another cave full of bodies and skeletons dating back
hundreds of years have been found on the site of the Guge Kingdom
in the western part of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say the find is important because very
few ancient tomb burials have been found in Tibet, which is famous
for its sky burial where bodies are left on a bier outside,
exposed to birds of prey.
</P>
<P>
They also say that the baby buried in an alcove is the first to
have been found in China and speculate that the parents hated to
bury their child far away, because according to rule children's
bodies could not be buried in the tribal cemetery. So, they buried
their child in their home or nearby.
</P>
<P>
The cave full of bodies and skeletons is on a cliff. The
remains are of some 30 persons, though whether they were nobles or
ordinary people, and were buried according to a normal system or
as some form of punishment, are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
The site of the kingdom is located in the Ali region some 5,000
meters above sea level. It is famous for its temples and grottos
with breath-taking wall paintings dating from the 10th to the 17th
Century.

BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) has called an emergency meeting to discuss stripping
Thailand of its right to hold the Asian Games in December next
year, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's Asian Games Organising Committee (BAGOC) has been
plagued by a series of resignations, disputes over sponsorship
contracts and accusations of political meddling and racism in the
run-up to the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Concern is heightened by the lack of tangible progress in the
preparation of the Games," OCA chief Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al
Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
It is understood the executive board does not have the power to
strip Thailand of the right to host the games, but a negative vote
would probably be endorsed by OCA which must vote on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Pets Banned in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) today issued a ban on electronic "pets" in schools, four
days before the fall semester starts on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people by the thousands, both kids and adults, have
been caught up in the craze over the small hand-held devices for
cats, chickens, dogs and dinosaurs, which can tell their owners
when they are hungry, sleepy or want to be entertained via a tiny
electronic screen.
</P>
<P>
The pets, which recently have become available in markets, have
had a negative influence on students' studies and the order in
some schools, an SEC official said.
</P>
<P>
To keep students' attention on their studies and improve school
administration, a circular issued by the SEC prohibits students
from taking the devices to school. SEC also will conduct a series
of educational activities to help students recognize the
disadvantages of the electronic pets, he said.
</P>
<P>
SEC will also formulate a regulation under which any of the
pets found at school will be confiscated, and children who take
the pets to exams will have their test scores canceled.
</P>
<P>
The circular also prohibits business people from marketing the
electronic pets, electronic game machines, other kinds of toys and
costly stationery to schools.

<P>
FUZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A museum to commemorate the
literary achievements of Bing Xin, one of China's most successful
female writers this century, has been built in her hometown in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>

Bing Xin, now hospitalized in Beijing, sent a speech to express
her gratitude to the people of her hometown, saying "I hope that
the museum can become a milestone in Chinese literature."
</P>

The museum has received many letters and telegrams from all
over China, as well as from Japan, Singapore and other countries.
</P>

Ba Jin, another major figure in contemporary Chinese
literature, did some calligraphy for the museum and Bing Xin's
family members donated many items related to her career.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Securities Officials Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Securities officials from Hong
Kong said that they are confident in the ongoing success of the
securities market of Hong Kong after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The listing of shares issued by inland companies or by
companies with inland business ties will not produce any negative
effects but rather increase choices and opportunities for
investors, Alec Tsui, chief executive of the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong, said in an interview with Xinhua during the ongoing
Ninth PACAP Finance Conference here.
</P>
<P>
The capitalization of the stock market of Hong Kong has reached
590 billion US dollars, the sixth largest in the world and the
second largest in Asia, Tsui said, adding that daily transactions
averaged 1.7 billion US dollars in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of the 622 listed companies, 34 are from inland
areas. He revealed that starting from September, the Hang Seng
Stock Index will include a sub-index for red chips stocks from the
inland companies.
</P>
<P>
After its return to the motherland, Hong Kong will continue to
serve as a bridge between the overseas and inland markets, Tsui
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivers W. Riley, chief executive of the Hong Kong Futures
Exchange Ltd., said that a mature and growing Hong Kong economy
will be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Hong Kong stock market will eventually
improve the capability of the inland areas to attract overseas
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laura M. Cha, a member of the Commission and Executive Director
of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, expressed
the hope that all companies listed in Hong Kong will strictly
abide by laws and rules to ensure market confidence and
prosperity.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan securities communities
expressed their hope to enter the capital market of the mainland
at an international financial conference here.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland capital market is attractive and we hope to come
in," Regina Chen, chairwoman of the Taiwan International
Securities Group, said at the Ninth PACAP Finance Conference.
</P>
<P>
The capital markets of the Mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong are
both competitive and supplementary, and interaction among the
markets will get stronger, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
About one in ten of the 600 experts attending the four-day
conference are from Taiwan. The meeting is jointly sponsored by
the China Education Association for International Exchange and the
PACAP Research Center of the University of Rhode Island of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The experts from Taiwan agreed that the implementation of
economic reform and opening-up policies has made the mainland a
global focus and a major element for the economic dynamism in Asia.
</P>
<P>
They said that they attach importance to the relationship among
the capital markets of the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong after
Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
A successful combination of the financial muscle of Hong Kong,
the production and management expertise of Taiwan and the huge
market potential of the mainland will greatly promote economic
growth in the three places, a securities executive from Taiwan
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lifts Levy on Property Purchase by Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
has decided to lift, effective from tomorrow, the levy imposed on
the purchase of properties by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the cabinet today, Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed 20 months ago a levy of 100,000 ringgit (about
35,714 U.S. dollars) on each purchase of properties above 250,000
ringgit (about 89,285 dollars) by foreign nationals with an
initial aim to control foreign ownership of properties in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said, "It is the low and medium-cost houses that we want
to protect, but they can buy the rest because there is supply for
that now."
</P>
<P>
For properties below 250,000 ringgit, foreign buyers would
require clearance from the local authorities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Provinces to Charge Extra Fees on Tobacco Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese provinces and
Shanghai Municipality have decided to charge extra fees for
tobacco products to fund smoking controls and healthcare
campaigns, according to a senior official with the Ministry of
Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
China has never before issued such fees on tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province will pioneer the move, collecting four percent
of the sales of local tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have
also worked out plans for the use of the extra fees in their own
health promotion drives.
</P>
<P>
"When there aren't central regulations in this field yet, these
areas have set good examples for the whole country," Cai Renhua,
director of the MOH's Health Policy and Law Department, told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
He said the new measure "kills two birds with one stone."
</P>
<P>
"It can on one hand curb the increase of sales of tobacco. On
the other hand, it can fund smoking-control campaigns and solve
financial problems in health care work," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Studies made in 1993 by the Health Economics Institute showed
that if an additional fee of 0.1 yuan was added to each pack of
cigarettes, the state would collect a total of eight billion yuan
(about one billion US dollars) -- the figure set for the national
health budget for that year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that China's tobacco industry produced 1.7
trillion cigarettes in 1996. The country's 320 million smokers
puffed away on 4.8 billion cigarettes per day, or 240 million
packs.
</P>
<P>
The colossal industry has been a major source for China's
revenue since 1987. It turned out 83 billion yuan (about 10
billion US dollars) in revenue in 1996, five times that of 1986,
according to a report from the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that adding extra charges on tobacco products and
using the money to promote good health is an effective plan used
in many countries to control smoking.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health
have agreed that the measure should be further spread in China to
combat tobacco-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Heart-controlled Mobile Phone Under Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at British Telecom
(BT) are developing new mobile phones that will automatically
alert a hospital if their owner's heart rate or blood pressure
reaches dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
The phones will also be able to show where the person is on an
electronic map if they become unconscious, according to The Times
published here today.
</P>
<P>
BT is developing a range of devices to help the disabled and
elderly people become less house-bound. Panic buttons that alert
the police or a carer are already routinely used to help the frail
and disabled to live in their own homes, but BT researchers are
studying ways of extending the idea.
</P>
<P>
Don Golding, of BT's laboratories at Martlesham Heath, Suffolk,
said that phones could be set up to trigger an alarm. For example,
if someone was on an errand or an outing, a central controller
could ring at a preset time to check they were all right.
</P>
<P>
An alarm call might be made automatically if the person strayed
outside a predetermined area. The call center could then alert an
ambulance or a member of the family.
</P>
<P>
"The call center could bring up information about the person
such as medical needs or telephone number of their doctor,"
Golding said.
</P>
<P>
The call center could also be used as an advice point. Golding
said that a person in a wheelchair who, for example, got stuck on
a country walk, could dial the center which could put them in
touch with the nearest taxi firm to come to their aid.
</P>
<P>
BT is looking at using the cell-phone network for the
system. Signals from the phone to at least three cellular
transmitters would allow the network to pinpoint the phone's
location.

<HEADLINE> HK's Hang Seng Bank Centralizes Back-Offices in New Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank, the second
largest locally-incorporated bank in Hong Kong, has relocated its
major back-office operations to the new Hang Seng Tower in East
Kowloon, to enhance the bank's operational and cost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The bank has invested over 1.2 billion HK dollars (154 million
U.S. dollars) in the premises, including purchase, decoration and
equipment costs.
</P>
<P>
The premises, which comprise 10 stories of office space, were
bought for about 1.1 billion HK dollars (141 million U.S. dollars)
in August 1995 and marked the bank's largest property purchase.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 staff from the bank's Credit Card Center, Trade
Services Center, Direct Banking Center and Network Support Center
occupy the new offices.
</P>
<P>
"The total office space occupied by our various support
departments in this building has increased by more than 50 percent
against their former locations. The additional space will cater
for their expansion until the year 2000," Alexander S. K. Au,
vice-chairman and chief executive of the bank, told the opening
ceremony of the tower today.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1933, Hang Seng Bank employs a staff of over 8,000
in its 147 local branches, as well as branch and representative
offices on the mainland.

<HEADLINE> US Restates Support to ECOWAS Move on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The efforts by west African
countries to solve the crisis in Sierra Leone got a boost Tuesday
when the United State reiterated its support to their measures
taken to reverse the May 25 coup in that country.
</P>
<P>
In a State Department statement, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said "we fully support ECOWAS' efforts to
restore President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah through mediation and the
use of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
"If negotiations do not succeed rapidly, we are deeply
concerned that force may be used instead," she said, quoted by
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks after a U.S. envoy was sent to
Sierra Leone to press for the return of the ousted legitimate
government.
</P>
<P>
The State Department statement said that Ambassador John
Hirsch will also consult with the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) on restoring democracy in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS leaders are to meet at a summit beginning this Thursday
in the Nigerian capital Abuja. The Sierra Leonean crisis is
expected to dominate the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and defence chiefs of the sub-region held
their respective meetings Tuesday in Abuja to discuss
recommendations and solutions for the coming summit.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nigeria's head of state General Abacha, who is also
current chairman of ECOWAS, visited Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali
and Gambia, all ECOWAS member countries.
</P>
<P>
He is reported to be in these countries to express his
disposition toward military action to oust the military junta in
Sierra Leone that has announced to remain in power until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Many observers here believe that the sub-region might be
arriving at a diplomatic consensus for the seeming inevitability
of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting of army chiefs from ECOWAS member
countries, Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff Major-General
Abdulsalam Abubakar admitted that "from all indications, peaceful
resolution through dialogue has failed."
</P>
<P>
He therefore stressed tightened sanctions and embargo as a
means to force the junta to step down.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the success of the sub-regional peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG in Liberia, saying: "We can successfully
undertake collective action in our sub-region."
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, the coup in Sierra Leone is capable of
destabilizing the peace and harmony in the sub-region and
undermining the resolve of ECOWAS to guarantee a stable policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the crisis was not insurmountable.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) is to be convened on September
12 in Beijing this year, according to a proposal of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary session today, the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee proposed that the Party's 15th National Congress

</P>
<P>
This proposal is to be submitted to the Seventh Plenum of the
14th CPC Central Committee for approval.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory work for the 15th CPC National Congress has
progressed smoothly. The draft report to be presented to the 15th
Party Congress by the 14th CPC Central Committee was adopted
at today's plenary session of the Party Central Committee's
Political Bureau, and will be submitted to the Seventh Plenum of
the 14th Party Central Committee for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, nearly 4,000 people discussed the draft report and
offered suggestions for improvement. Among them are members of the
14th CPC Central Committee, members of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the CPC, deputies to the 15th CPC
National Congress, Party members in charge of various Party,
government and military departments under the central authorities
and various people's organizations, and leaders of Party
committees of all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
as well as major military area commands across the country.

All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and personages
without party affiliation. Ideas from other relevant sides were

<HEADLINE> Kuala Lumpur Stock Market Under Selling Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index (CI) of
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange today slipped further on continued
selling, mostly by foreign funds, due to the weakening ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Heavy foreign selling was seen on most blue chip counters.
</P>
<P>
The CI fell 8.08 points to close at 847.92 today against
Tuesday's close of 856.00 points.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts said foreign investors were shying away as they
felt that the bearish sentiment which remained on the stock market
and the weakening ringgit were signs of economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
At the close today, the ringgit was at 2.8260/10 against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Emas Index also lost 2.79 points to 245.42, the second
board index slipped 13.52 points to 434.31, while the Industrial
Index fell 2.12 points to 1,742.88.
</P>
<P>
Losers led gainers by 598 counters to 107 with 99 others traded
unchanged and 82 untraded.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the day totaled 319.297 million shares worth 1.499
billion ringgit (about 530 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The main board volume increased to 280.781 million shares worth
1.165 billion ringgit (about 410 million U.S. dollars) from
254.018 million shares valued at 1.106 billion ringgit (about 390
million U.S. dollars) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Second board volume also rose to 38.516 million shares worth
333.197 million ringgit (about 118.99 million U.S. dollars) from
34.821 million shares valued at 325.707 million ringgit (about
116.32 million U.S. dollars) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Direct business transactions increased to 63.617 million shares
worth 448.083 million ringgit (about 160.02 million U.S. dollars)
from 31.175 million shares worth 246.190 million ringgit (about
87.92 million U.S. dollars) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts do not see the market recover in the short period as
foreign funds continue to look at the local stock market by the
performance of the ringgit and the trade data.
</P>
<P>
The July trade data to be released either tomorrow or the day
after are anticipated to see a deficit of about 800 million
ringgit (about 285.71 million U.S. dollars).

TIANJIN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of foreign
residents in Tianjin, a port city in north China, showed that 94
percent of the respondents are satisfied with the city's public
order.
</P>
<P>
The figure has increased by 4.7 percentage points, compared
with a similar survey conducted by the local police three years
ago. And nearly 90 percent of the foreign residents said they feel
safe in the city, an increase of 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The survey questioned more than 1,690 foreigners from 57
countries and regions, including the United States, Japan and
Singapore. The foreigners surveyed included enterpreneurs,
technical personnel, teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
The city, with a population of nearly 10 million, has become
famous for its low crime rate in the last four years, which has
become a main attraction to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
An American teacher working at Tianjin Teacher's University had
suggested in the survey that an English interpreter be hired to
receive emergency calls in the police station. To his surprise,
the police immediately accepted his advice.
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't expected they would pay attention to my idea. Their
ability to deal well with the public is a sign of the city's good
public order," the teacher said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ringgit Dips Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ringgit dipped
further to breach the 2.8200 mark in late trading today.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit, which opened at 2.7945/95 against the U.S. dollar
this morning, dipped to 2.8070/90 at around 3:40 p.m. after
hovering at between 2.7940 and 2.8050 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
It then drifted further to 2.8260/10 at the close, a plunge of
almost 380 points against Tuesday's close of 2.7880/10.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit like the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah has been
under a lot of pressure of late. The local unit is being pressured
by talks that U.S. funds were accumulating long dollar/ringgit
positions.
</P>
<P>
The weakening in the stock market has also fueled the selling
of the ringgit as offshore players liquidated their stocks and
then sold ringgit and bought U.S. dollars to repatriate their
funds.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the stock market's barometer, the Composite Index,
hit a new 31-month low when it touched the 871.75 level. It was
870.75 on January 25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that the ringgit may touch the 3.00
level to the U.S. dollar," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said ringgit speculation was not a new problem
to the local financial market as between 1993 and 1994 there was a
massive inflow of short-term speculative funds into the system.
</P>
<P>
"The rise and fall of a currency is normal, and the country's
currency is still considered 'stable'," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, market observers said the ringgit's downslide was
still prevailing and the local unit may continue to be weak in the

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Cracks Down On Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China solved 245 smuggling cases involving
200 million yuan between January and June this year.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials and police also seized 94,000 grams of heroin
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has long coastal lines and borders Vietnam and
Myanmar. The complex geographic features make the region a good
passageway for smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled goods included automobiles and automobile parts,
cigarettes, drugs, oil products and weapons. During the first half
of this year, for example, 168 cars were confiscated by police and
customs officials.
</P>
<P>
The region has in recent years stepped up its crackdown on
illegal trafficking by tightening supervision on markets and ports
that are open to border trade. Checks on cargo ships on the sea
waters have also been intensified.

<HEADLINE> Manila Allows Political Campaigns Through Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives has
approved on third and final reading a bill which allows the use of
mass media for political campaigns, the Philippines News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The existing law prohibits all candidates, without exception,
from using mass media for political campaigns and other purposes,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, House Speaker Jose de Venecia said the 1992 elections
showed that the ban on media advertisement diminished the chances
of newcomers to get elected, thus, instead of leveling the playing
field, the ban actually favored candidates already known to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved Tuesday night, recommends that political
parties and candidates be allowed to buy air time and print space
directly from duly registered mass media such as newspapers,
magazines, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
The country would have its presidential election in May next
year and de Venecia is one of the presidential aspirants.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts on Universal Declaration of Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese human rights expert Fan
Guoxiang said here today the importance of human rights has
acquired a world-wide acknowledgment since the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948.
</P>
<P>
Fan made the remarks at the 49th session of the Sub-Commission
on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities under
the United Nations Human Rights Committee, scheduled for August
4-29.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an
important historical document," Fan said, "At the same time, it
has its historical limitations. Nearly half a century has elapsed,
full of earth-shaking events of a broad spectrum."
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption of the declaration, the membership of the
United Nations has been more than tripled. "It is only natural
that newly independent developing countries have their interests
and concerns to look after", Fan said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration has been continuously enriched with the passage
of time, with some 80 declarations, conventions, convenants,
principles, rules, safeguards, codes of conduct, guidelines,
protocols, and statutes added so far.
</P>
<P>
"Historical development in the world will inevitably offer new
basis to build up fresh ideas on human rights, which, in return,
will contribute to a better and deeper public awareness of the
rights and interests of the people so that further social progress
may be achieved," Fan said, adding that human rights, "both
factual and conceptual, cannot remain static."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In an extraordinary interview with a French newspaper,
Diana, Princess of Wales, has lashed out at the British
press, condemned the former Conservative Government as
"hopeless" and declared that she would have left Britain
years ago but for her children.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair returned for his three-week holiday last
night aiming to refocus his government on the "big
picture" of politics after a summer of ministerial
squabbling and public relations debacles.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Substances Used in Tobacco Industry Depleting Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two chemical substances used in
the cultivation and processing of tobacco can cause depletion of
the ozone layer, according to an American scholar speaking at the
ongoing 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health.
</P>
<P>
Methyl bromide, a potent pesticide which is widely used in the
tobacco cultivation both for soil pre-treatment and fumigation, is
causing an estimated 10 percent of the global ozone depletion each
year, said Fran du Melle, deputy managing director of the American
Lung Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
"The odorless, colorless, tasteless gas is also known to be
toxic to the central nervous system, the lungs and kidneys, and is
a potential human carcinogen" Melle said.
</P>
<P>
Chloroflourocarbons, used in the processing of tobacco, also
are responsible for eroding the ozone layer, she said.
</P>
<P>
Since the ozone shields the earth from the sun's damaging
ultraviolet rays, its disappearance may result in increased risk
of skin cancer and cataracts as well as immune system suppression,
she explained. It may also lead to economic loss for agriculture,
fisheries, forests and tourism, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer were signed in 1987 to protect the
ozone, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, developed countries were required to
freeze their production and consumption of methyl bromide in 1995
at a base level, and completely stop using the substance by 2010;
while developing countries are to freeze production and use at low
levels in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco industry is rapidly shifting from the outdoor
seedbed method, which requires fumigating the soil, to on-farm
greenhouses," Melle said. In the United States, she added, the
shift is expected to affect 90 percent of the tobacco production
by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China, Brazil, Thailand, Zimbabwe and other
developing countries are also experimenting with alternatives to
methyl bromide.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria: 100 Feared Dead in Boat Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- About 100 people, mainly women
and children, were feared dead when two boats collided along the
</P>
<P>
About 80 survivors were reported to have been rescued by
Tuesday morning, while no corpses had been found as of Tuesday
evening, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The large wooden boats have a capacity of 80 passengers each
but were said to be carrying about 120 passengers apiece.
</P>
<P>
A survivor attributed the accident of Monday night to bad
weather, saying there was heavy downpour which impaired
visibility and made it difficult for the drivers to manipulate
the boats which were filled beyond capacity.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the number of people whose whereabouts were yet to
be ascertained, property worth millions of naira was lost.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred 48 hours after a similar one involving a
speed boat claiming two lives on the Bonny River in Port
Harcourt, the oil producing base of the country.
</P>
<P>
The speed boat carrying about 18 passengers ran under water
after suffering a serious wave-battering from a passing powerful
oil company barge.
</P>
<P>
On July 23, about 10 persons drowned in another boat mishap
when the boat in which they were travelling capsized mid-sea.
</P>
<P>
pAAccording to reports, traffic has been on the rise in the
area as more people move from Port Harcourt to Bonny and Bayelsa
state in search of work and other economic activities.

PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The draft law on immigration to be presented by Interior
Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement to the parliament, whose content
was revealed by Liberation, has aroused criticism and
disappointment of the groups who support the paperless immigrants
in France.
</P>
<P>
They reproached the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
for not abrogating the immigration laws elaborated by two former
conservative interior ministers, Charles Pasqua and Jean-Louis
Debre, as the Socialist Party promised during the legislative
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- The celebration organized from Monday by the Swiss city
Basle to mark the 100th anniversary of the first Zionist congress
held in the city was overshadowed by the revelation of Nazi Gold
wartime history between Switzerland and Germany as well as the
impasse of the Middle East peace process. Moreover, the local
Jewish community leader Ursula Rhein received many letters full of
words of insult and threat over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will meet in Bonn on Thursday to celebrate the good
augury of their countries' economies, unexpectedly stimulated by
the rise of the U.S. dollar, which will allow them to realize the
euro on time.
</P>
<P>
But on the other side of the coin, the rise of the dollar is
shaking the balance of the Bundesbank which has openly complained
about the rising inflation in Germany caused by the increasing
prices of imported commodities which are bought with the green
back. The stock exchange indexes throughout Europe continued to
fall on Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- A experimental project to privatize France's social
insurance system, which was proposed by the AXA insurance group
and accepted by the Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine
Aubry, is expected to be rejected by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
due to strong opposition from the unions.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Free of Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has become a country
free of anti-personnel mines after it transported Tuesday its last
batch of such military devices for destruction in neighboring
Germany.
</P>
<P>
A train carrying of 115,480 anti-personnel mines left Bertrix
late Tuesday and arrived overnight at Pinnow in Germany, where the
mines will be destroyed through incineration.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has chosen Germany for the destruction of
anti-personnel mines because it is less expensive there. Domestic
incinerators had demanded some 40 Belgian francs for destroying a
single mine.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is the first country in the world to have made a law in
1995 banning the production, exportation and utilization of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Belgium destroyed a total of 313,472
anti-personnel mines in Germany.
</P>
<P>
So far, all European Union member states, except Greece and
Finland, have banned anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that about 100 million
anti-personnel mines have been laid out throughout the world since
World War II, which combine to claim an annual casualties of some
20,000 people, mostly innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Most of the live anti-personnel mines still can be found in
former conflict-stricken regions such as Cambodia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia and along common borders of former
Cold War foes like Finland and Russia.

BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said today his government would like to gradually resume
contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He told a German newspaper that Germany would consider the
willingness to hold dialogues with Germany and the European Union
(EU) proposed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, newly elected Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Charrasi said he would like to hold talks with Kinkel, adding that
if Kinkel is interested in such a meeting, it is welcome.
</P>
<P>
Iran is also preparing to resume dialogues with the EU,
however, he said, it has not got any official proposal from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that the German government would discuss with the
EU about the reaction to Charrasi's remarks and whether Kinkel
himself would hold talks with Charrasi has been undecided.

An unidentified Iranian foreign ministry official told
reporters if Iran and Germany begin to normalize their relations,
Iran would send a new ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Germany have worsened with both
sides calling back their ambassadors in the other country since

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that amending the constitution will make the country's political
system more responsive to the challenges and opportunities the
incoming century will bring.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this week that Ramos defended the charter
change campaigns seeking to extend the term of elective officials
including the president.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines must re-examine its constitution thoroughly to
improve the country's capacity to promote the interests of the
national community, Ramos told the opening of the Biennial
Conference of the Law Association of Asia and the Pacific in
Manila.
</P>
<P>
"While I have stated time and again my stand on this issue --
that I do not seek a second term for myself -- I nevertheless
recognize and respect the people's right to petition for
constitutional change," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was also the right of congressmen to decide what is best for
the country's future by ways of enlightened laws and even
amendments to the Constitution, he said, referring to the move by
Congress to convene itself into a constitutional assembly to
discuss Charter changes.
</P>
<P>
Opposition senators and congressmen have rejected the move to
amend the Charter at this time.

<P>
Changsha, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province, the hometown of
the late Chairman Mao Zedong, is to emerge as an economic power in
central China due to a strengthened opening-up policy on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the province has reported a
12 percent increase in its gross domestic product -- the value of
goods and services produced -- over the corresponding period last
year, which is 2.6 percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at an economic take-off, Hunan has no choice but to adopt
a more deepened opening-up policy, said Wang Maolin, secretary of
the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The province, a renowned revolutionary base for Mao during the
1930s, lagged behind its coastal counterparts during the early
years of China's reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, designated as Hunan's "year of improvement in
investment environment," the province drew foreign investment
equaling half the total volume in the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Though a landlocked province, Hunan borders on two of the most
vibrant regions in the country, the Yangtze River Economic
Belt to the east and the South-China Economic Belt to the south.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make the best use of this geographical location," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said a city belt along the Beijing-Guangzhou Rail Artery,
with capital city Changsha at the core, will be built into an
economic corridor where a concentration of high-tech industries,
export-oriented enterprises and high-profit trading companies will
gather.
</P>
<P>
The corridor has attracted 70 percent of all foreign capital
flowing into the province.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourist Arrivals Up Sharply in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourists
traveling to northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
has been increasing sharply in recent months, local officials
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 foreigners arrived in Xinjiang in July, 30 percent
more than in the previous month, Zhang Jie, an accountant with the
regional Tourism Bureau, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The figure is estimated to jump to 21,000 this month, up 10
percent from last August, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, rich in both natural and cultural resources targeting
tourists, has witnessed a continuous rise in foreign visitors
since mid-spring.
</P>
<P>
In May and June, the region received 22,000 foreign tourists,
equaling to the total number from the January-April period. Local
officials expected that the tourism industry will maintain the
momentum in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
After a five-day stay in Xinjiang last week, Mr. Pascal, an
architect from Switzerland, described Xinjiang as "extremely
attractive."
</P>
<P>
"There are unique scenic spots here. Local people seem to live
a good life," Pascal said.
</P>
<P>
Folke Von Knbloch, general manager of the Central Asia Tourism
Corporation based in Alma-Ata, who recently completed a month-long
business trip in the region, remarked that Xinjiang has great
potential for tourism and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to spend 100,000 U.S. dollars on building a
ski course in Yili Prefecture in West Xinjiang. "Tourists from
southeast Asian countries will definitely like it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
experience another power rationing this year due to declining
water level at the giant Mtera hydroelectric power plant.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye while
adjourning the current National Assembly budget session in Dodoma
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye in his speech directed accounting officers in
government departments to ensure that power was used
economically, saying that effective this fiscal year they must
settle power bills from their budgets.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government would no longer shoulder the
burden of serving electricity and water bills of the public
offices.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his disappointment with some
government offices which left their lights on even when the
offices were closed or during weekends or public holidays.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said that to avert the power problem, various
alternative sources of power would be surveyed and established to
ensure factories produce at their installed capacities and the
state earn its much needed revenue.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Congo (K), Rwanda Studying Road Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A study to link Uganda, Rwanda
and Congo (k) by road, rail and water was launched here Tuesday
after two days of talks by experts from the three countries,
reported the local daily, The New Vision, today.
</P>
<P>
The study will cost 300,000 U.S. Dollars to be contributed by
the members, the paper said, adding that a joint technical task
group to carry out the study was ready.
</P>
<P>
The study follows a decision by the presidents of the three
countries who met recently in Kinshasa, to link their countries
to facilitate trade and increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the railway link, according to Ugandan Minister of Works,
Transport and Communications, John Nasasira, the task group is to
study the Kasese-Goma-Kigali and the Kasese-Kisangani-Pakwach
links. Preliminary studies have shown that the Kampala-Kasese
route was feasible with a capacity of moving cargo to the tune of
800,000 tons at a time.
</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to the capacity at which Uganda's cargo
moves through Mombasa and Dar Es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
On road network, the study will include Arua-Aru-Mahagi and
Nebbi- Goli-Mahagi-Bunia and Kisangani while another will be
Kases-Mpondwe-Beni-Mambasa.
</P>
<P>
On water transport, the technical group will study how to link
the three countries through lakes.
</P>
<P>
The telephone network to link the members is yet to be
studied.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ministers of communications from the three
countries will soon lead a delegation to the European Union to
solicit for funding for the project.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel ara Moi
said that the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and
himself would only hold dialogue over constitutional reforms with
people's elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
The "Kenya Times" today quoted the president as saying in the
port city of Mombasa Tuesday that the approach by the National
Convention Executive Council (NCEC) was "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the NCEC second plenary session held here
Tuesday, opposition leader Willy Mutunga said that NCEC would
form a parallel government because KANU had turned a deaf ear to
their call for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the council also planned to establish Radio Nuru
in defiance of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Act.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader spoke of a program of intensified mass
action to push KANU into talks with the NCEC.
</P>
<P>
The reform lobby group NCEC said that it would force Kenyans
to stockpile a one-month food ration when they effect mass action
to press the government to accede to their demands on reforms.
</P>
<P>
In response to his speech, KANU Secretary General Joseph
Kamotho said on Tuesday that the plan to establish an alternative
government by unlawful means was "treasonable".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Kenyan government was aware that a
foreign country was supporting and financing these machinations.
</P>
<P>
"KANU requests the law enforcement agencies of the government
to be extra vigilant and deal with the situation as it arises and
ensure that lives and properties of Kenyans are protected."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Defense Minister
Jean-Paul Poncelet has approved an airshow scheduled for early
next month at Florenne.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet approved the acrobatic flights after receiving and
reviewing safety and security reports from show organizers, local
television RTBF reported today.
</P>
<P>
The airshow will be held on September 6-7, the first after a
crash at the July 26 airshow at Ostend, killing 10 people and
injuring 55 others.
</P>
<P>
All acrobatic flights had been under an investigation after the
crash, results of which attributed the crash at the Belgian
seaside resort to errors committed by the pilot of the Falcon
XT300 biplane.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing video recordings of the fatal flight and the
debris of the crashed plane, aviation experts and designers and
manufacturers of the German-made acrobatics-oriented plane

Royal Falcon Squadron, was flying directly overhead the spectators
before the plane spun out of control and crashed onto a tent at
the edge of the spectator area.

The Ostend airshow has been held five times and the July 26
crash was the first fatal accident.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Develops World's First Anti-Hacking Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Information Security
Agency (KISA) has developed two anti-hacking software products,
possibly the first hacker-tracing program in the world.
</P>
<P>
Online SecuDr is a program designed to diagnose a computer
system's vulnerability to hackers, while SecuLog frustrates
attempts to erase or alter traces of illegal penetration, Goh
Seung-cheol, a senior KISA researcher, was quoted by a local
newspaper today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Using Online SecuDr, KISA has started its free diagnosis
service, which is available on request. System managers who want
to check their systems can request the service by accessing the
agency's Internet home page (http://www.kisa.or.kr) and punching
in the names of the host computer, its address and type of
operating system.
</P>
<P>
With the information, Online SecuDr would automatically check
the system, determine its weaknesses and send a diagnosis to the
system managers via e-mail, Goh said, adding that the service
"will be very useful in preventing hacking".
</P>
<P>
He said SecuLog, a program to trace hackers, would
automatically retrieves log files which hackers abolish or alter
to eliminate any trace of their infiltration.
</P>
<P>
A log file records all attempts to access a computer
system. System managers usually hide about 200 hard copies of the
log file in their own computers, making it difficult for hackers
to destroy it completely.
</P>
<P>
"It usually takes time for hackers to delete all of the 200
copies hidden in the computers of system managers. SecuLog races
against the hackers to retrieve the log file. If hackers fail to
destroy all of the 200 copies before SecuLog retrieves any of
them, they lose and leave behind evidence of their break-in," Goh
said.
</P>
<P>
He said since SecuLog is the first hacker-tracing program in
the world, they are planning to apply for domestic and
international patents and also to transfer the technology to a
private software developer for its commercialization.
</P>
<P>
Till a commercial product comes out, the agency plans to
provide the program to those who want it, which is available in
Korean- and English-language versions.
</P>
<P>
Goh added that his team would begin upgrading the program as
hackers are expected to develop ways around it in about two
years.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Returns to Win in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Open champion Andre
Agassi returned to win over his compatriot Steve Campbell 6-1,
6-1, 4-6, 6-3 on Tuesday night in the first round of the U.S. Open
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, former No.1 in the world, played as the old one to go
through half of the match when he broke six times. Feeling the
pressure of Agassi's unleashed backhand, 130th-ranked Campbell
held his serve just once before he pull back one set when Agassi's
form wavered slightly.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, losing semifinalist of last year's U.S. Open, soon
recuperated and the rout continued to its inevitable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has lost seven of ten tournaments this year. Tuesday's
win was a good starter when he returned to the Grand Slam with his
ever-lowest rank as 63rd in the world.
</P>
<P>
In other matches on Tuesday, Michael Chang, second seed and
last year's runner-up, and third-seeded Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov
blasted their opponents with straight wins.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
breezed over American qualifier Geoff Grant 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 6-2,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Australian Open runner-up Carolos Moya of Spain
slumped into a humiliating defeat against 64th-ranked Guillaume
Raoux of France. His compatriot 16th seed Albert Costa failed to
have his name on the second-round list too in a clash with another
Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch, ranked 31st.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Alex Corretja of Spain trounced Marc Rosset of
Switzerland 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Republic Adopts Resolution Against Plavsic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- No decisions made by Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic on the change of military and civil
personnel will be approved by the Parliament, the Republic of
Srpska declared today in Pale.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament of the Republic of Srpska held a meeting today
in Pale and passed a resolution on the current crisis facing the
republic, the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament will neither discuss nor accept any of the
decisions made by Plavsic bypassing the constitution and laws,
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the constitutional court of the republic declared
unconstitutional Plavsic's decision to dissolve the Parliament,
the political and security situation in the republic has rapidly
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
It is likely to lead to a split in the people from the organs
of power, and a split in the nation, the resolution pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also accused multinational Stablization Force
(SFOR), the International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the
Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of
changing their authorizations.
</P>
<P>
The three forces, the resolution noted, threw weight behind one
of the conflicting sides, which could make the Republic of Srpska
a protected nation subject to military occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament required the government and all its institutions
to most firmly defend the independence of the Bosnian Serb
Republic, its constitutional order and organs of power.
</P>
<P>
The government, the Interior Ministry and security institutions
should work out an action plan within 24 hours to defend the
constitutional order and organs of power, demanded the resolution.
</P>
<P>
With the conflicts inside the leading body of the republic
coming into the open, the conflicts and struggles between Plavsic
and the Parliament as well as the government which was on the side
of the Parliament became increasingly intense.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts and opposition within the leading body have
generated a crisis of emerging two political powers in the
Republic of Srpska.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Reforms in Tourism Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China will open up its tourism
sector in the next few years to make it better fit the reforms in
the socialist market economic framework, says He Guangwei,
chairman of the China National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the country's tourism industry will make
some improvements based on the work of the past several years, and
that the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) should have a far-reaching impact on the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry has made some progress and has become one
of the fastest-growing sectors of the national economy in recent
years. In 1996, China ranked fifth in the world in the number of
overseas tourists and ninth in foreign exchange earnings from
tourism.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the number of overseas tourists annually to China is
expected to reach about 71 million and earnings, about 43 billion
US dollars. There will be an estimated 2.5 billion Chinese also
traveling in the country, who will bring an additional one
trillion yuan (126.5 billion US dollars) in earnings.

<P>
"To attain that ambitious goal, we must take the necessary
steps in introducing a modern enterprise system to the tourist
industry by the end of this century", He observed.
</P>
<P>
Existing large tourism enterprises will be transformed into
more powerful conglomerates by issuing shares, and medium-sized
enterprises will be encouraged to become corporations.
</P>
<P>
Small enterprises will be helped through reorganization,
mergers, acquisitions, and share issue.
</P>
<P>
While reforms are being pushed forward, measures will also be
taken to open-up the tourism sector still wider, He noted,
explaining, "We continue to welcome and encourage overseas
business people to invest in hotels, scenic spots, tourism product
development and transportation."
</P>
<P>
"We also welcome overseas travel agencies with a good
reputation to set up joint venture travel agencies in national
holiday resorts."

<P>
In 1996, self-paid tourists on package tours organized by
travel agencies made up 32.4 percent of the Chinese travelling
overseas, as opposed to fewer than 20 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were 636 million Chinese traveling in the
country, and spending 163.8 billion yuan (19.734 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said he believes progress in the tourist industry is mainly
attributable to the strong support from the Chinese government,
which in 1992 listed it as one of the focuses of the service
sector for accelerated development.
</P>
<P>
It was at this time that tourism was, for the first time,
considered an industry instead of part of foreign affairs as it
had been previously.
</P>
<P>
The status of tourism was further improved when, at the Fifth
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held in 1995,
tourism was put in first place in the service sector for "vigorous
development".
</P>
<P>
"The attention of the central government has aroused the
enthusiasm of local governments in developing tourism," He said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 of China's 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities directly under the central government have
designated tourism as a pillar industry.

<HEADLINE> Central China Farmer Finds Old Olympic Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An Olympic medal dating back sixty
years that was discovered by a farmer in Hubei province in central
China is believed by experts to be a bronze medal for the 1936
winter Olympic games at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The farmer found the medal two years ago when his house was
being torn down for renovation. He took it for an ordinary old
coin and gave it to his child to play with.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when he was watching the Olympic Games in Atlanta
on TV, he recognized the design on his coin as the same design on
the screen, the Olympic logo.
</P>
<P>
So, he sent the medal to Beijing, where a close examination by
experts showed that the bronze medal had the Olympic logo in the
middle and the date and place of the games engraved around it. The
reverse side has the image of skis, ski boots and a carriage.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the bronze medal could hardly have belonged to any
Chinese person because China did not take part in those games. But
because Jingshan county, where the farmer lives, is near the
Hankou-Yichang highway, where the Japanese troops had a strong
presence during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression
(1937-1945), it might have belonged to a Japanese soldier or
officer.

NANNING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A cave in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been identified as a hide-out
of Ho Chi Minh, the former leader of the Vietnamese Communist
Party, in the 1940's.

</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Vietnamese Communist Party members came to
the cave frequently and left many poems there. One poem written by
Ho can still be seen on the ceiling of the cave.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health authorities have
made an urgent announcement asking the public to be cautious about
picking or eating wilding mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after poisonous mushrooms took the lives of 73
people in Yunnan province in southwest China between late June and
early July.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 255 people in the Simao prefecture suffered from
poisoning after eating mushrooms they picked in fields in the
locality, and emergency treatment managed to save the lives of the
other 182.
</P>
<P>
China has some 90 toxic fungi which can look very much like
edible mushrooms to the untrained eye.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health asked local departments to
provide pictures of poisonous mushrooms in their locale for

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Growth Momentum, Says Japanese Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese economist Hiroshi
Takeuchi said China has completely changed its face since it
introduced the reform and opening-up policy and applied the
socialist market economy on the basis of the reform.
</P>
<P>
Takeuchi, who is greatly interested in the achievements China
has made in these years, said he is sure that China will continue
to march forward in big strides.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Monday, Takeuchi said China's
economic achievements are obviously unusual with an annual
economic growth rate of about 10 percent and a considerable trade
surplus in recent years. Its financial deficit is not big and its
economic development smooth.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese economist attributed China's prosperity to its
successful reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Takeuchi said it is indeed unprecedented that reforms could be
so successful in such a big country as China with a population of
1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
The success embodies the strength and wisdom of the Chinese
people, Takeuchi said. Deng Xiaoping is a great statesman, who
could respond quickly to the call of history and make farsighted
decisions that conform to historical trend.
</P>
<P>
Deng conducted the planned reform by making experiments first
and then popularization, thus avoiding turbulence, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the reform and opening-up, China began to adopt
a socialist market economy, he said. China successfully
transferred to the market economy because it has a strong and
unified government which boldly carried out flexible
policies. Without such a government, Takeuchi said, it would be
impossible to pursue practical policies.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, he said that without the wise "one
country, two systems" principle, there would be no successful
return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Takeuchi pointed out that the concept of "one country,
two systems" is of very far-reaching significance. The late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proposed the principle on China's
profound social basis. China has long been good at carrying out
various characteristic policies in accordance with the country's
actual conditions. That's why the Chinese government has been able
to handle the relations between urban and rural areas, inland and
coastal areas successfully.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Takeuchi said that China has made remarkable achievements in its
reform and opening-up policy and the socialist market economy.
However, there are still great challenges facing the Chinese
people. Problems such as state-owned enterprises, the imbalanced
development of the inland and coastal areas all need to be solved
properly. The above problems are not solely confronted by China
and it is not to say that these exiting problems are tougher in
China than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Finally he expressed the hope that China will make greater
steps forward in its development after the 15th Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party.

YANGON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will practice new
regulations on remittance abroad of foreign exchange, according to
today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Myanmar Minister for Finance and Revenue Win

for loan and interest will also be permitted up to the same amount
per month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
If foreign exchange is received from export, the new
regulations have no such limit to the payment and will be handled

<HEADLINE> Two Drug Peddlers Arrested in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Pakistani passport holders
have been arrested in Kathmandu for drug trafficking, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Khalik and Nashrullah, allegedly notorious drug peddlers,
were caught red-handed Monday when they were trying to sell in a
shop a coat containing heroin worth 25,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Altogether four such coats were recovered from the duo with 870
grams of white heroin worth 16 million rupees (about 280,000
dollars), the reports quoted an anti-drug official as saying.
</P>
<P>
These drugs could fetch 440,000 dollars in the market of the
United States, the official added.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary inquiries, the two revealed that their
coats were prepared in Pakistan by another party and that they
were here just to sell them.
</P>
<P>
The duo is believed to be important members of a large drug
racket operating in the region, which has been using Pakistan as
conduit to supply Afghan drugs to the West, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Their passports show that they have traveled to Nepal thrice
between March and May this year.
</P>
<P>
This time the police managed to net in the duo after being
tipped off by international agencies, the official said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Premier's Visit to Malaysia, Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily today carried
an editorial hailing Premier Li Peng's visit to Malaysia and
Singapore. The editorial reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng visited Malaysia and Singapore on August 21-26
at the invitation of his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts,
Mahathir Mohamad and Goh Chok Tong. He was warmly welcomed and
given generous hospitality by the governments and peoples of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li exchanged views in a comprehensive way with leaders
of the two countries on bilateral relations and regional and
global issues of common concern. He also made wide contacts with
personalities of various circles and answered questions of their
concern.
</P>
<P>
The visit has attained the goal of increasing understanding,
expanding consensus, enhancing mutual confidence and promoting
cooperation. We warmly hail Premier Li Peng's visit as a complete
success.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and Singapore are China's friendly neighbors.
There has been a gratifying development in their cooperation in
various fields since the two countries established diplomatic
relations with China, and the development has been achieved with
their joint efforts, and especially with the direct concern and
promotion of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
China and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) share extensive common interests and there are no
fundamental conflicts between us.
</P>
<P>
We all suffered from prolonged foreign aggression. At present,
we are all dedicated to the maintenance of world peace and
regional stability, development of the economy and raising the
living standards.
</P>
<P>
We are all following the principles of mutual respect, equality
and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs; All of us are pursuing a policy of good-neighborliness
and friendship; We are all actively promoting regional economic
cooperation to seek common prosperity; We are all taking an active
part in regional and global affairs and maintaining good
consultation, coordination and cooperation in these affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, there exists a solid
foundation for further developing the good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered in Malaysia entitled "Towards a
Relationship of Friendship and Good-Neighborliness Geared to the
21st Century", and in the speech delivered in Singapore entitled
"Strengthen Mutually Beneficial Cooperation and Promote Common
Prosperity", Premier Li said the ASEAN, as an important regional
organization, is playing an increasingly important role in
maintaining world peace and promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the speeches, he put forward proposals that China and the
ASEAN countries should respect each other and treat each other as
equals, strengthen dialogue and intensify consultation, seek
common development based on mutual benefit, support each other and
expand cooperation, and bear in mind the larger picture, seek
common ground while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
These proposals are of great significance in the further
development of the overall relations between China and the ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
Today, with the accelerating multipolarization of the world,
China faces favorable opportunities in developing a new
cooperative relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN). We will make use of our individual
characteristics and advantages and adopt flexible ways of
cooperation to continuously open up new channels and expand the
fields for cooperation. We will, on the basis of our current
cooperation with ASEAN, carry out further cooperation in such
fields as infrastructure, sophisticated technology, resources
development, poverty elimination and environment protection. We
will also strengthen our coordination and cooperation in the field
of finance to heighten financial management, perfect financial
systems, guard against and reduce financial risks and guarantee a
healthy development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes ASEAN countries to continue coming to China and
running factories. China will invest in and run factories in ASEAN
countries in the form of technological and trade cooperation. In
addition, China can set up joint ventures with ASEAN countries and
cooperate in a mutually beneficial way in a third country.
</P>
<P>
There is great great significance for China in the
strengthening of good-neighborly relationships with ASEAN
countries and the boosting of cooperation of mutual benefit. It is
an undertaking that concerns the fundamental interests of both
sides and plays a vital role in maintaining peace and development
in the region. China will continue to make constant efforts in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> India to Increase Outlay for Small Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India is planning to increase
its outlay for the country's small scale industries (SSI) in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998-2002) in a bid to enhance its
development.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry has proposed to spend 42,960 million
rupees (1,210.14 million U.S. dollars) during the period against
an outlay of 28,621.4 million rupees (817.75 million dollars) in
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the ministry sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
SSI units, badly hit by low quality technology, are expected to
get 9,550 million rupees (269.01 million dollars) as central
assistance during the plan period for upgrading and modernization.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry plans to pump in another 3,750 million
rupees (105.63 million dollars) for providing training and
developing human resources. The ministry has proposed to set up 60
leading skill and craft training centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
SSI units have played an important role in India's economic
development. Exports from SSI sectors, for instance, account for
45 percent of the country's total exports.

<HEADLINE> Donating Blood Helps Reduce Risk of Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Donating blood can help
reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in non-smoking men,
an American medical magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
After a three-year study of about 4,000 people, American
researchers found that the men who had never given blood were
almost twice as likely to have had a heart attack, stroke or
angina as those who had donated blood in the previous three years,
the journal Heart said.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of non-blood donors catching certain
cardiovascular diseases was also three times higher than donors,
the report by a Kansas University research team said.
</P>
<P>
"Depletion of iron through blood donation may reduce coronary
heart disease among donors," said David Meyers, head of the team.
</P>
<P>
Iron can help increase the production of fat-like substances in
the human body, which could narrow the artery walls and produce
potentially fatal clots, he said.
</P>
<P>
Women are less likely to suffer from heart disease because of
iron loss during their menstruation, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
However, the study shows that for men who smoked and women,
donating blood could not provide better protection against heart
disease. There was also no more benefit reported from donating
blood more than once every three years.

<HEADLINE> India Bans Four Companies from Exporting Seafood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India's Commerce Ministry has
suspended four companies from further exporting seafood, the
ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The action is seen here as damage-control exercises of the
Indian government in the wake of the proposed European Union (EU)
hygiene-related ban on the import of seafood from India recently.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team of the Commerce Ministry has been sent to
the coastal city, Cochin, in southern India, to ensure that
exporting units of seafood adhere to the stipulated hygiene norms.
</P>
<P>
The team will also identify the units that will continue to be
eligible to export their products.
</P>
<P>
India's 10 shipments of seafood worth about 36,000 U.S. dollars
had already been rejected between January and July this year by
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU had recommended a total ban for an unlimited period
after its team had visited and inspected the conditions of
exporting units in India. The team had found the conditions on
seafood farms very poor and had stipulated that these farms meet
international standards if they were to export their products to
EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended the ban temporarily following repeated
requests from the Indian government.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Fund Hit By Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The current currency crisis
across Southeast Asia is hitting a plan by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enlarge its financial reserves
fund, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is discouraging ASEAN members from contributing to
the fund as each of them has incurred huge foreign debts during
their efforts to defend their own currencies, the Nation newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that five major ASEAN members had agreed at a
conference of East Asian and Pacific central banks in late July to
extend the ASEAN Reserves Fund by renewing a dormant 200 million
U.S. dollar swap agreement for one year beginning on August 5.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement concluded by Singapore, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, an ASEAN member country in
need of liquidity can exchange its local currency for U.S. dollars
provided by other members as a short-term means to improve their
balance of payment.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts praised the ASEAN move to increase the fund to
defend the currencies in the region, but doubted the plan will be
realized under the current circumstances as every country in the
region is eager for funds to survive.

JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Support poured in Tuesday for
Indonesia's ruling party's proposal to name incumbent president
Soeharto as its candidate for the presidential election next year,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party Golkar Chairman Harmoko, Armed Forces Chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid and Chief of the
Supreme Advisory Council Sudome have separately welcomed the
proposal put forward on Monday by Golkar, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moestahid Astari, chief of the Golkar Faction at the House of
Representatives, suggested on Monday that the Golkar Executive
Board heed the aspirations of its members and voters for the
renomination of Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly will convene in
March to draw up the broad guidelines of state policies and elect
a president and a vice president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who turned 76 last June, has ruled the country for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
"Age is relative. The most important thing is that (Soeharto)
is willing to lead the country in a period of transition from the
20th century to the 21st century," Moestahid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Development Party (PPP), one of the three
political parties in the country, expressed reluctance to follow
in Golkar's footsteps in announcing its presidential nominee now,
with seven months left before the actual presidential election.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Investment For East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Fujian province, a
pioneer in China's opening-up drive, will improve its investment
environment and services for overseas investors to attract more
overseas funds for its economic growth, according to Governor He
Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, Fujian had approved 21,700 overseas-funded
enterprises with a total of 46.96 billion dollars worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
The influx of funds, which now account for 40 percent of the
province's fixed assets investment, have become a powerful force
in the local economy, whose GDP topped 260.6 billion yuan in 1996,
the governor said. Fujian now leads the country in per-capita GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, a lack of services, which are important to the area's
investment growth, has been a source of complaints among overseas
business people and has in part contributed to a slump in overseas
investment in Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Drought in Indonesia Worsens Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The current drought in Indonesia
is expected to reach its climax in September as the water
shortage, haze, and drought-related health problems are likely to
worsen.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the drought, which has lasted for more than
three months, is part of the El Nino phenomenon, State Minister
for Environment Sarwono Kusumatmaja said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest data from the Environment Office indicated that
large-scale haze problems caused by fires are still affecting
Indonesia's Kalimantan, Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra provinces.
Around 16,000 hectares of forest areas have been burnt for
plantation in the country this year, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The haze has wrought havoc with flight schedules in the areas
and also neighboring Serawak and East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia have held talks to discuss the haze
problems while Singapore has sent a daily report on the latest
"hot spots" in Indonesia, Kusumatmaja said.
</P>
<P>
The most violent El Nino episode in 1982-83 was responsible for
almost 2,000 deaths and 13 billion U.S. dollars in damages as
droughts, fires, floods and hurricanes swept cross the global from
Tahiti to India.

TIANJIN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin has built 20 million sq.m. of residential housing in the
past several years, improving living conditions for more than
400,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Per capita living space in the city proper is twice what it was

housing construction since 1987 when it started reforming the old
practice of distributing government-subsidized apartments as a
form of welfare.
</P>
<P>
The city has also encouraged 80 housing co-operatives in
suburban towns and county seats and among workers with moderately
low incomes in the city.
</P>
<P>
It has helped demolish four million sq.m of dangerous, run-down
housing to make way for new apartment buildings to move people
into more spacious apartments.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 residents of the city's suburban towns and
county seats have left their shabby living quarters and moved into
new apartment buildings with better heating, gas, water and

HAIKOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade relations
between Hainan and Taiwan, China's two island provinces, have
improved in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
From July 20 to August 7, eight Taiwan groups of 148 people
from industry, trade, arts, education, and journalism visited
Hainan, meaning one group every two days on the average.

<P>
Their focus was on agriculture, mainly the planting and sale of
tropical fruits and vegetables, breeding of aquatic products, and
agriculture for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of Taiwan residents coming to Hainan
shows that China's stable social and economic situation after the
return of Hong Kong has increased Taiwan businessmen's confidence
in investing in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural co-operation between Hainan and Taiwan has seen
rapid progress in recent years. Hainan now has over 200

BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's textile exports
increased by 0.5 percent to 67.3 billion baht (2.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first half of this year compared with the same
period last year, according to the Thai Garment Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's high-end textiles which were exported under the
quota agreement with the United States, the European Union (EU),
Norway and Canada rose by 1.2 percent to 32.8 billion baht (1.26
billion dollars) in the six-month period when compared to the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of low-end textiles which were shipped to
foreign countries with no quota restrictions fell by 4.5 percent
to 34.4 billion baht (1.32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. represented the strongest growth with a jump of 19.3
percent, worth 18.3 billion baht (703 million dollars) for
Thailand's high-end textiles, followed by Canada with a 8.4
percent increase to 1.1 billion baht (42 million dollars).

Textile exports to the EU and Norway, however, continued to
decline, with the EU down by 4 percent to 13.2 billion baht (507

<HEADLINE> New Teaching Method Experimented For Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An experiment that started 15
years ago on learning to read and write Chinese earlier than usual
now involves 3 million pupils in 30 provinces, regions and
municipalities and about 100,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese students used to spend a long time just learning to
read and write because of the characters, which are not based on
an alphabet.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, a group of teachers in Heilongjiang
province began to use a new method, getting the students to learn
characters by reading and writing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The students had to write compositions at a younger age and
when they encounter characters they didn't know, had to use the
Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, a system of phonetic symbols.
</P>
<P>
The teachers also employed special textbooks of
transliterations into the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet so that
students could study the texts whether they knew the characters or
not.
</P>
<P>
The new method caught the attention of people elsewhere. Three
new textbooks have been compiled and education departments have
held meetings for teachers to discuss their teaching experience.
</P>
<P>
The experiments showed that reading comprehension and writing
ability increased as a result and that students were more able to
teach themselves and had a wider range of knowledge, and were
better at observation and thinking.
</P>
<P>
The experiment has also attracted interest abroad among
linguists in the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, and
Australia who think that the new method can help foreigners learn
Chinese.

KUNMING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from the fields of
linguistics, archaeology, geography, and history are becoming
interested in the Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas),
an early Chinese geographical text.
</P>
<P>
The 31,000-character book from the Warring States Period
(403-221 B.C.) was for a long time regarded as a book of folklore
and legends of the geography and peoples of ancient China and
Western regions.
</P>
<P>
Many scholars are now of the opinion that it is an encyclopedia
of ancient times, covering geography, history, minerals, medical
science, religion, meteorology, and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese scholars and those from Japan, France, Spain and
elsewhere are interested in the book, according to Professor Gong
Yuhai, chairman of the Shan Hai Jing Society. Yunnan's provincial
science and technology commission established a group in 1994 to
study the book.
</P>
<P>
They have found a close relation between the book and a large
number of petroglyphs dating back to the New Stone Age in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shihao, vice-director of the commission, said that the
study may lead scientists to a better understanding of
civilization's origins.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Defends Decision to Postpone Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today denied any link of the government decision to postpone
the repatriation of Albanian refugees with Albania's refusal to
take them back.
</P>
<P>
Dini dismissed reports that Albania had "blackmailed" Italy
into extending the deadline of August 31 for another two months by
threatening not to accept the refugees until Italy delivers its
promised aid.
</P>
<P>
"We aren't blackmailing Albania and they aren't blackmailing
us," Dini told reporters. He said a final decision on returning
the estimated 10,000 refugees in Italy will be made at a cabinet
meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
While rejecting criticism by the opposition that the government
gave in to Albanian pressure, Dini emphasized the fact that "Italy
certainly cannot take the decision to load 10,000 people onto
ships and unload them on Albanian coasts."
</P>
<P>
The government came under mounting fire from the public for
being "too lenient" with Albanian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
About 17,000 Albanians had fled their homeland for neighboring
Italy since spring when the collapse of a shady savings scheme
there sparked nationwide anarchy and plunged the country into a
heavy political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 have reportedly returned. Of the remaining 10,000,
it is known that 3,000 remain in Italian refugee camps but the
whereabouts of the others is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Some of the remaining Albanians would rather stay than go back
home. A refugee spokesman said that returning would mean
"hopelessness" for them who have lost everything in the crisis.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China is embracing the world's
latest financial technologies in its drive to upgrade banking
services, said a bank official at the on-going China International
Exhibition on Financial (Banking) Technology and Equipment which
opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although China is still behind developed nations in banking
computerization, the country is moving quickly to close the gap,
today's "China Daily" quotes Chen Jing, general director of the
Settlement and Technology Department under the People's Bank of
China (PBOC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
China will introduce the latest technology and equipment, such
as automatic banking machines, banking on the Internet and data
warehousing, which represent the future of banking, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition, hosted by the PBOC, has attracted 176
firms from 13 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits include banking computer networks, bank card systems
such as Automatic Teller Machines and Points of Sale systems,
multimedia technology, banking apparatus, settlement and clearing
systems, information services and banking security systems.
</P>
<P>
The official said a nationwide electronic network has taken
shape in recent years. About 70 percent of the country's banking
outlets are using some form of computer system.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China will intensify its study
of more efficient uses of energy, which is important to sustained
economic development, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Improving the energy production and consumption structure,
diversifying energy and power systems and building
environmentally-friendly energy systems are important strategies
for the country's development, the newspaper quotes Chen Yuxiang,
deputy-director of the Administrative Center for China's Agenda
21, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's problems in the energy industry include: poor
efficiency of energy utilization, shortages and serious wastes of
energy, obsolete technology and inefficient management.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government regards improving energy use efficiency
and reducing coal-produced pollution as essential to sustained
energy development, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the government has tried to phase out
equipment and products that consume too much energy, swap "clean"
technology for coal-based energy, and develop new and renewable
resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal and biomass
energy, it says.

ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto

ambitions after a meeting here with his Turkish counterpart Ismail
Cem.
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistake to isolate certain countries," he said at a

visit to a European capital since his government took office last
month. "Turkey is Europe, for years it has been an associate
country."

He made the remarks with particular reference to some European
countries' intention to exclude Turkey from the group of countries
invited to begin procedures aimed at eventual membership of the
union.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Cyprus, Dini said that there were now two
distinct "entities" on the island, Turkish Cypriots and Greek
Cypriots, and that both had to be included in talks on the
island's future membership of the EU.
</P>
<P>
He argued that it would be a mistake if Brussels were to

<HEADLINE> Celtic Find Way to UEFA with Dying-minute Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Scottish Celtic sailed into the
lucrative format of the UEFA Cup by sealing a 6-3 victory with
dying-minute goals over Tirol Innsbruck of Austria for 7-5 on
aggregate at Glasgow, Scotland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simon Donnelly put Celtic ahead with a 34-minute goal before
the visitors equalized five minutes later by Christian Mayrleb,
double-striker of the first leg.
</P>
<P>
German Andreas Thom drove home from a well-organized free-kick
after 44 minutes and Tirol rallied back anew to level for the
second time through Francis Sebereyns just before the break.
</P>
<P>
In the second-half, Celtic geared up to evaporate Austrians'
hope of the next round at the UEFA.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly scored his second from the penalty spot when onrushing
Swede Henrik Larsson was upended in the area on 68th minute.
Burley scored twice in the 70th and 90th minutes and Wieghorst
joined the spree with his 88-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
Tirol replied with substitute Gurnot Krinner's score in the
82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Dundee United went down 2-1 aggregate at Trabzonspor
of Turkey after Hami drew at 1-1 with just nine minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Andy McLaren kept the United's hope alive when Dave Bowman's
deflected strike was palmed away by the Turkish under-21
international Metin. Lars Zetterlund, unmarked on the left,
collected the rebound from the post before he picked up McLaren
who finished the move.
</P>
<P>
It hushed the crowd before Hami rifled an angled drive with a
solo run to put the Turks firmly in the driving seat.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights saw Hungary's Ferencvaros hammered Sweden's
Helsingborgs 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw on aggregate. The
10-man Malmo slumped into a 2-0 defeat by Croatia's Hajduk Split
with aggregation score of 5-2. First leg hero Jonas Wirmola was
sent off in the first quarter-hour.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Invest Heavily in Petrobras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- An 18.7 billion
U.S. dollar slice of the capital that flows into the oil and gas
industry of Brazil will be invested in the state-owned oil
company, Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
It will come from the capital inflow into Brazil's oil and gas
industry which will have amounted to 32 billion U.S. dollars by
the year 2002. The estimate comes from a study by Brazil's
Association of Infrastructure and Basic Industries (AIBI).
</P>
<P>
Petrobras will invest 5.12 billion U.S. dollars in 10 projects,
said Jose Augusto Marques, the chairman of AIBI.
</P>
<P>
Such plans must be developed along with private funds, he added.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2002, private participation in Brazil's oil and
gas industry must reach 6.9 billion dollars", Marques stressed.
</P>
<P>
Among the most important projects for the next four years was a
refinery plant worth 700 million dollars, as well as a
Campos-Victoria pipe line costing 150 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Open Policy Improves Ties, says Sakurauchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The president of Japan's
International Trade Promotion Association, Yoshio Sakurauchi, said
here Tuesday that China's reform and open policy has greatly
promoted the development of Sino-Japanese ties in economy and
trade.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi, also the former speaker of Japan's Lower House,
said in a written statement delivered to Xinhua that China has
made outstanding achievements in every social field since it
adopted the economic reform and open policy 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The reform and open policy has brought about tremendous
development and changes to Sino-Japanese relations on the economy
and trade, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sakurauchi, two-way trade amounted to 62.4 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, compared with 5.1 billion dollars in
1978. China became Japan's second largest trading partner in 1994,
and investment by Japan in China reached 14 billion dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Now, China is not only a big supplier of energy, agricultural
products and semi-manufactured goods, but also a great
manufacturing base and a huge market for Japan, Sakurauchi said.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the two countries to further strengthen bilateral
economic ties, Sakurauchi said: "From the point of view of
strategy, Japan and China should deepen mutual trust and further
enhance close and friendly ties while a new framework is being
established in the world following the collapse of the cold war."
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi also expressed hope that Japan and China would
further strengthen cooperation and contribute to peace and
stability in Asia and the world at large, into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Austria Urges Maintaining Single Currency Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Austria urged the European Union
(EU) to observe the timetable set for monetary integration among
all member nations in order to avert economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian news agency quoted Wolfgang Schuessel, vice
federal chancellor and foreign minister, as saying that
"preparatory work has already been completed to such an extent
that delaying the launch of the single European currency, the
Euro, could -- like a high-speed train brought to a sudden stop --
result in serious chaos."
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, who made the speech tonight in the Alpbach Forum,
said any postponement would hurt the overall plan for European
integration and lead to confusion in financial and economic
policies. He said any change would bring about distrust among the
world's partners.
</P>
<P>
Austria has already met all the demands of the economic and
monetary union (EMU) except for the state debts, according to
Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
He believes Austria will become a member of the EMU in the
first group.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, which set the deadline for the issuance
of the Euro on January 1, 1999, has compiled a list of convergence
criteria on budget deficits, debt, inflation, interest rates and
exchange rates that EU member states must meet before they can
join the single currency.
</P>
<P>
But several EU countries are having trouble meeting some of the
criteria, notably the budget deficit conditions.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Strengthen Role in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will dispatch
more staff to its resident mission in China and seek an enhanced
role in that rapidly growing country, a senior World Bank official
said.
</P>
<P>
The staff assigned by the Washington-based headquarters will
increase to 16 from the present level of 6-7 in two years, while
more local competent people will be hired, Yukon Huang, director
of the China Program and chief of the Resident Mission in China,
told Xinhua here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang, an American national educated at Yale University, was
assigned to this new post in July after serving the World Bank for
over 20 years, including three years as director of the Country
Department III. He plans to leave for Beijing in late October.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is empowered to make 80 percent of the relevant
decisions, a privilege his predecessors did not enjoy. The change
came within the framework of the "Strategic Compact" introduced in
the world financial institution last year to improve its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will continue to provide assistance to China's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of these projects are performing well," said
Huang, who also said that "they (the Chinese) are more careful and
more focused on doing some things."
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank will pay more attention to the central
and interior parts of China, which are not as economically
developed as the coastal regions.

<HEADLINE> HK Flag Carrier to Expand Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flag carrier
Cathay Pacific Airways is expected to largely expand its aircraft
fleet in the three years following the opening of Chek Lap Kok
airport next year.
</P>
<P>
A report in today's South China Morning Post said the airline
is now in discussions with the world's two dominant airline
manufacturers about the possible take-up of aircraft during 1999
and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cathay has options on 25 aircraft with an overall value in
excess of 32 billion HK dollars (4.1 billion US dollars), which
will be ready for delivery between 1999 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
There is believed to be a strong chance that all of Cathay's
options in 1999 and 2000 -- decisions on which are due by the end
of this year --will be made firm, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these options, Cathay also has 13 firm orders for
aircraft scheduled for delivery from around the opening of the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
Cathay has been stressing for some time that its growth at the
existing Kai Tak airport has been impeded by the lack of new
slots. The new airport is scheduled to have two runways operating
by the end of next year, and will also be open 24 hours --
allowing far more flights than is possible at Kai Tak.

compared to the 25.8 millimeters of the 500 lira coin, and
heavier, weighing 8.8 grams compared to the 500 lira's 6.8 grams.
</P>

weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The political crisis in the
Republic of Srpska should be solved through a complete election,
President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He also opposed foreign forces taking a biased attitude toward
any of the conflicting sides in the republic.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the statement at a meeting with Robert Frovik,
envoy of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe to
the Republic of Srpska, the Yugoslavian newspaper Vecernje Novosti
reported.
</P>
<P>
A democratic and complete election is the best solution to the
current crisis facing the Bosnian Serb Republic, Milosevic said,
referring to a simultaneous parliamentary and presidential
election.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Tax Revenues up 6.4 Percent in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tax revenues in Italy rose by 6.4
percent in the first six months of this year compared with the
same period in 1996, the Finance Ministry reported today.
</P>
<P>
Revenues amounted to some 270 trillion lire (152.5 billion
dollars). The increase in June alone was 30.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total included some 1.9 trillion lire (1.07 billion
dollars) of the one-off Eurotax imposed to make sure Italy
qualifies to take part in the launch of the European single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministry figures showed that most taxes produced
increased revenues, but there was a fall of nearly 54 percent in
takings from the scratch card lottery game.
</P>
<P>
This followed a controversy arising from the refusal of the
authorities to pay a number of holders of winning tickets in
Bergamo because of alleged printing errors.

<HEADLINE> Swiss-U.S. Bank to Sell Costa Rican Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss-United States joint
venture bank has won the bid to sell bonds for the Costa Rican
government on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Banco Credit Suisses First Boston will launch an auction
overseas for 200 million U.S. dollars worth of Costa Rican bonds,
Costa Rican finance officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government will use the money to replace part
of its domestic debt as the international interest rates are lower
than the home levels.
</P>
<P>
The bank will get a commission of one million dollars for
auctioning the bonds, which several other big financial firms, JP
Morgan, Salomon Brothers and Deustsche Morgan Grenfell, had also
been competing for.
</P>
<P>
Vice Finance Minister Marvin Taylor said one of the reasons the
bank was chosen was that it was an European-U.S. bank, and Costa
Rica looked forward to having a solid participation in the United
States market.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it would support the secondary market to assure
the stability of the bonds' price.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate OKs 10 Pct Tax on Foreign Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has finally
agreed to a 10 percent tax on foreign currency deposits, the
Manila Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's session which tackled the last phase of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP), the Senate voted 12-6 to
approve the 10 percent tax scheme, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, chairman of the Senate Ways and
Means Committee, had earlier proposed a 20 percent tax on foreign
currency deposits to align it with the prevailing rate on peso
deposits.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign currency deposits are not subject to any
tax in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mainly because of the government's lax tax treatment, foreign
currency deposits grew from virtually nothing in the early 1980s
to the current 14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bankers are worried that the imposition of the tax may trigger
a capital flight while others opposing the scheme believe that the
tax may act as a deterrent to foreign investors whose investments
have helped spur the growth of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to approve the CTRP bill in the next
few days. The bill will then go through the bicameral conference
committee to allow representatives of the upper and lower chambers
to reconcile their conflicts, the newspaper said.

CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard unleashed an
extraordinary attack on state premiers yesterday, vowing to
respond with gusto to what he described as their unfair attacks on
the Federal government.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Sweden has been rocked by reports that 60,000 people, mainly
women, were forcibly sterilized between 1935 and 1976 under a
"racial hygiene" program organized by the now defunct Institute
for Racial Biology.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Japan wants to scrap its two-yearly ministerial meetings
with Australia, widely regarded in Canberra as the centerpiece of
bilateral relations, on the ground that they have become unwieldy
and time-wasting.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australian banks have been beaten by the country's
communications giant Telstra in the race to be first into the
crucial smart card market and now face being sidelined in the
battle to cement customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
The Telstra smart cards, which use electronic chips to store
relatively large amounts of information, can provide a wide range
of services on a single card, such as bill payment, ticketing,
records storage, tracking loyalty programs and customizing mobile
phones.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
a total of 295 million U.S. dollars in financing for projects in
Armenia and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The financing includes 60 million dollars for Armenia's second
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC II) and 5 million dollars for
the country's second Structural Adjustment Technical Assistant
Credit (SATAC II).
</P>
<P>
The SAC II will support the Armenian government's program to
consolidate macro-economic stability and to lay the foundations
for sustained private-sector led growth. The SATAC II will be used
to finance technical assistance in support of the government's
economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The financing also includes a 230 million dollar loan for
Kazakhstan public sector resource management adjustment project.
</P>
<P>
The project will support the government's institutional and
policy reform program, which is designed to increase budget
revenues through improved resources mobilization and better target
government spending through a more efficient use of the limited
resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- This year's Adidas Predator
Cup will see a big boost as a record number of over 2,500 players
are expected to take part in the two-day local tournament
scheduled for October 4-5 this year at the Hong Kong Sports
Institute (HSI).
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the HSI, the Hong Kong Football
Association and Adidas Hong Kong Limited, Predator Cup will have
extra flavors this year as the best local players are to play
against one another in the newly established Super Group.
</P>
<P>
A total of 396 teams will contest seven age group titles and
the women's championship will be played by 24 teams.
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Boy's 12-or-under group will be sponsored by
Adidas to Paris and compete for Hong Kong in the under-14 World
Championship with teams from over 40 countries and regions
participating.
</P>
<P>
The innovative format of football, originated in Germany two
years ago, has been well received in Asia and was proved
attractive to the local youths when the inaugural championship was
organized here last year.
</P>
<P>
To be played in a turf pitch a quarter the six of a standard
one with no keeper guarding the goals, the four-men-a-side
Predator Cup is exciting to watch and is an effective means in
training strikers.
</P>
<P>
The 378 matches in last year's tournament produced 1,847 goals,
which meant an average of 4.89 goals per match.
</P>
<P>
The local football association wishes that the new tournament
helps promote the game as it is open to kids as young as eight
years old.
</P>
<P>
Six members of the winning team of the tournament will
represent the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in
the Predator Cup World Championship June 6-10 next year as a
prelude to the World Cup '98, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Lower Against German Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against
the mark Tuesday as Germany's central bank left interest rates
untouched.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 1.7953 marks,
down from 1.8205 late Monday. It was the lowest level since July
21 and left the dollar down 5 percent from a nearly 8-year high of
1.8832 on August 5.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 118.18 yen in New York, down from 118.79.
The British pound was quoted at 1.6147 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6093 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the dollar was slightly lower despite traders'
belief that Japan's sluggish economy means its interest rates will
remain low.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.4840 Swiss francs, down from 1.4989; 6.0505 French francs, down
from 6.1310; 1,753.70 Italian lire, down from 1,774.30; and 1.3983
Canadian dollars, up from 1.3914.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- London and Dublin have agreed on
an international commission to oversee the hand-over of terrorist
weapons during Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said the "Independent International Commission on
Decommissioning" would operate alongside full-scale talks due to
start on September 15 and would have offices in Belfast and
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Irish Foreign
Affairs Minister Ray Burke signed an agreement on the commission
during 90 minutes of talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland hope that the establishment of a commission
to supervise a handover of armaments will be a spur for
multi-party talks that have been paralyzed by rows over the
illegal weaponry for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that we cannot force people to hand in
weapons," Mowlam said. "But what we have is a structure to
facilitate that from day one of talks," she added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Faces Pilot Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force expects to
have 350 fewer pilots than it needs next fiscal year and to suffer
pilot shortages for all aircraft types the year after, an
Associated Press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Brig. Gen. John F. Regni, the director
of military personnel policy for the service, as saying that at
present, the Air Force is short fighter pilots and those who fly
C-130 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
By fiscal year 1999, "all our weapons systems... will be
undermanned," includes pilots for tankers, transports and fighter
planes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regni attributed the shortage to the lure of high pay among
commercial airlines, the end of the challenge of the Cold War, and
cutbacks in personnel that translate to increased probability
pilots will be sent overseas on lengthier deployments.

specialists.

The report listed other states with numbers of nuclear weapons.
They are Nevada with 1,450, including Air Force cruise missiles
and bombs in storage at Nellis Air Force Base, and North Dakota
with 965, including intercontinental ballistic missiles at Grand
Forks and Minot Air Force bases.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Adjustments in Four Argentine Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
four adjustment loans totaling 300 million U.S. dollars to back
fiscal and public financing reforms in four Argentine provinces
---Rio Negro, Salta, San Juan and Tucuman.
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, the public sector is highly decentralized. The
country's 24 provincial governments are responsible for 45 percent
of Argentina's public expenditures, and in 1995 they undertook 97
percent of public basic education costs, 92 percent of public
health outlays, and 84 percent of public welfare expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The four loans are designed to help reform and restructure
their governments to ensure efficient and responsive delivery of
public services, specially social services to the poor, while
improving fiscal accounts.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will also provide technical assistance and
analytical support for the four provinces.
