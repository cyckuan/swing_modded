<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and China will further
strengthen their economic relations by setting up joint ventures,
President Yoweri Museveni said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, President Museveni said
Ugandans can sell coffee to the Chinese and exploit the Chinese
market of a population of about 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the second largest coffee producer in Africa just
after Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who had made a five-day state visit to China and
returned home yesterday, noted that it would be beneficial to set
up a joint venture with a Chinese company to help Uganda market
its coffee in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are also interested in Uganda's cotton, he said,
emphasizing that joint venture investments invariably benefit the
two countries as well as giving Chinese businessmen a chance to
exploit the wider Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that during his discussions with
Chinese leaders they agreed that each country should develop
according to its own internal dynamics.
</P>
<P>
Museveni expressed satisfaction with China's good foreign
policy which does not interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries.

MAPUTO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Tourism announced here today that a number of
regulations will be made public soon to protect its beach
environment and ocean resources.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's spokesman Rafael Nambale said that it is

grave damages. He noted some of the country's beautiful sea
beaches have become garbage heaps or cycle racing grounds.

<P>
According to the forthcoming regulations, domestic and
international tourists will not be allowed to fell trees,
picnic cooking, toss garbage at will and do cycle racing at the
beaches.
</P>
<P>
Nambale said that without permission in advance, no foreign
traveler is allowed to do fishing and boat racing in sea shores
and nobody is allowed to collect any seabed resources.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the regulations are part of a plan to
develop the country's tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> PLO Executive Committee Meeting Held in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El ARISH, EGYPT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The PLO Executive
Committee began its meeting this evening in this Egyptian
Mediterranean resort town.
</P>
<P>
President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat arrived
here earlier this evening from Gaza to attend the
meeting. Altogether 11 members of the Executive Committee,
including Arafat, showed up for the meeting, according to a source
close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was expected to discuss the convocation of a
meeting of the Palestinian National Council, or parliament-in-
exile, to amend the Palestinian National Charter and the
formation of a self-rule cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded that PLO revoke sections in the charter
that call for Israel's destruction before the Palestinian-Israeli
talks for a final settlement start in May.
</P>
<P>
Arafat needs a two-thirds majority vote of the PNC to amend the
Charter. The PNC currently has 483 members. But the 88 members of
the newly elected Palestinian Council governing the West Bank and
Gaza will be automatically added to the PNC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly hinted that the PNC will be convened in
April, after the meeting of the Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
But the PNC's acting Chairman Salim Zanoun has said that he
doesn't think a vote was possible before May.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the PLO to hold its executive
committee meeting since the first Palestinian elections last
month.
</P>
<P>
PLO official Saeb Erekat said Sunday that the meeting is of
vital importance as it will lay down the foundations on which the
Palestinian political life will be based for the coming three
years.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee is made up of 18 representatives from
various Palestinian factions and independents. It acts as a sort
of government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
The committee last met in Cairo in November last year to
discuss peace negotiations following the assassination of Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Ten committee members were present at the last meeting,
including Arafat, providing a quorum.

charges.

Radio Mozambique is currently facing a severe financial

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes US Official's Visit to Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed its
welcome to a forthcoming visit to the island country by
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus government will receive Holbrooke because we aim
to establish dialogue and negotiations to reach a settlement of
the Cyprus question," Government spokesman Yiannakis said in his
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came in the light of Greece's decision today not
to receive Holbrooke, citing difficulties in Holbrooke's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who leaves the diplomatic service later this
 month, was expected to visit Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in the
coming week to focus his talks in Athens and Ankara on the recent
crisis in Eastern Aegean Sea. During the crisis, Greece and
Turkey, both NATO allies, came close to a war because of a
dispute on the Imia island.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. statements following the crisis had
annoyed Athens and led to a strong Greek lobby in the United
States to protest to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Cassoulides said "Holbrooke is welcomed
 here to help solve the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher told
the press after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides that
Holbrooke would probably be in Cyprus next week, but did not
commit himself to any dates.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke himself said last week he would visit Athens,
Ankara and Nicosia, but stressed his visit to Cyprus would not
signal the beginning of a long-awaited U.S. initiative to
push the Cyprus peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke has described 1996 as the "year of the big push
for Cyprus".

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit To Eradicate Hunger, Says Diouf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming world food
summit will seek commitment to a policy statement and a plan of
action to eradicate hunger worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by Jacques Diouf, Director General of the
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO),
according to a latest news release issued by the FAO office here.
</P>
<P>
The world food summit will convene in Rome, Italy, in November
1996. Its participants are expected to adopt a set of commitments
aimed at ending hunger and promoting universal food security, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted the FAO Director General as saying that
"world food production will have to increase by more than 75
percent over the next thirty years to keep pace with population
growth".
</P>
<P>
Diouf expressed his belief that the summit due to be held
under the slogan "food for all" could be a milestone in pursuit
of the right of access to sufficient food.
</P>
<P>
The release indicated that some 800 million people, 200
million of them children, are chronically undernourished in the
developing world alone.
</P>
<P>
Diouf emphasized the importance of increased production for
increased self-reliance in the areas where food is needed most.
</P>
<P>
"Uunless the international community and national governments
address the underlying causes of undernutrition, 15 years from
now there still be around 750 million hunger and undernourished
people in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rejects UN Security Council Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today declared its
rejection of a U.N. Security Council resolution, which said Sudan
had given sanctuary to terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference today, Ghazi Salahuddin, Secretary
General of the Sudanese National Assembly, called for resistance
by all means against the resolution until it is abolished or
amended.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of the U.N. resolution Tuesday, the
U.S. announced in the following day that it ordered a withdrawal
of all Americans from its embassy in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the National Assembly released a statement
describing the U.N. Security Council resolution as another chapter
in the conspiracy against Sudan so as to subject it to
international sanctions, by accusing it of hosting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the resolution adopted by the Security
Council, which was passed with strong U.S. backing, assumes
without evidence that Sudan is giving refuge to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
This stance, the statement said, is neither based on objective
grounds, nor founded on the principles of justice.
</P>
<P>
The statement further called on the Organization of African
Unity to bring the case back to the African framework, and to
persuade the Ethiopian and Egyptian governments into cooperation
with the Sudanese government in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution on January 31
demanding Sudan to hand over within 60 days three suspects accused
of taking part in an attempt on the life of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June. Ethiopia had earlier
demanded Sudan to hand over the three suspects.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Exodus of UK' Tories for Fear of Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Tory party is
facing the biggest clear-out of serving parliament members for
nearly a quarter of a century for fear of defeat in next general
election due to be held in May 1997, said a survey published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that growing numbers of the Conservative MPs
opt for retirement or alternative careers rather than the prospect
of opposition.
</P>
<P>
Last December, three senior Tories announced that they would be
standing down, and now the number has increased to 52.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, the party will lose at least
about 65 MPs by the time of the next election in 1997 and probably
many more, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The scale of departures compares starkly with the numbers
standing down at the close of previous parliaments -- 58 at the
1992 general election, 43 in 1987, 34 in 1983, 24 in 1979 and just
14 in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Advancing age and the belief that they should give way to
younger generation is the official reason given by many, but there
there is significant disillusionment about the direction of the
Tory party which is increasingly shifting to the right, the survey
analysed.
</P>
<P>
A number of Tory MPs have not attempted to hide their
disillusionment with the Westminster system and the government
policies on Europe, privatization and state benefits.
</P>
<P>
Others cannot face the dispiriting task of fighting a marginal
seat.
</P>
<P>
And last, but quite likely a decisive factor is the minds of
many, is the dispiriting prospect of life in opposition, the
survey said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends U.S. Budget for 1997 to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua)--U.S. President Bill Clinton
today sent to Congress an outlined new budget for fiscal 1997 and
said he would balance the budget over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would spend 1.64 trillion U.S. dollars in 1997 which is
an increase of 4.1 percent from the projected spending of 1.58
trillion U.S. dollars in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The new budget deficit of next fiscal year will be 166.6
billion, up form this year's 154.4 billion U.S. dollars. But
President Clinton said that U.S. budget deficit would decline
steadily beginning in 1998 and there would be balanced budget in
2002 with a surplus of 3.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Republican has reportedly rejected the new budget.
</P>
<P>
The fight between the U.S. government and the GOP-controlled
Congress over the budget of 1996 is endless even though the
current budget year is one-third gone. The prolonged budget fight
has resulted in two government shut-downs and many government
agencies are still operating under a stopgap funding resolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the National governors' Association as the White
House releasing the new budget today, President Clinton said that
"I hope we can set aside bipartisanship and division...and provide
a balanced budget plan to the American people in the future."
</P>
<P>
He called on Republican leaders to find common ground, using
his new budget outline.

be one way of seeing through any proposals the EU representative
might put forward.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman refrained from naming the EU countries
who share this position, which was communicated to the Cyprus
government.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the EU Council of Ministers appointed a
representative of the EU presidency (Italy), whose mandate is to
visit the area and report to the Council on how the EU could
contribute to a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The EU's move is part of the international peace efforts to
seek a solution to the Cyprus problem, created as a result of
Turkish military intervention and taking control of northern third
of the island following an Athens-backed coup in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Early Elections Should not Affect Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said here this afternoon that early elections in
Israel should not affect the peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks at a meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived here last
night in yet another attempt to advance the peace process between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Peres and Christopher discussed the
renewal of Israeli-Syrian peace talks in the Wye Plantation in
Maryland, U.S., later this month.
</P>
<P>
Peres reported to Christopher on the Israeli government's
decision to call early national elections, and he reassured the
U.S. Secretary of State that the move will not affect the talks
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported lately that Peres and his Labor party
have decided to advance the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
elections, originally scheduled to be held in October this year,
to May.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres refused to commit to any date for the
elections, saying that he would decide on a date and announce it
by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher told a press conference, after his
meeting with Peres in Jerusalem, that whatever decision (on the
early elections) is made by the Israeli government, the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks would be continued.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Israel and Syria are laying foundation for the
peace treaty which we all hope will come."
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, both Peres and Christopher said they
were very satisfied with the way the negotiations between Israel
and Syria had been conducted lately in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Christopher pointed out that there is a quality of difference
from the past negotiations, describing the last two rounds of
talks in Maryland as "open and candid."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides are discussing ways to reconcile
their needs, their security needs in particular, and that they
have deepened their understandings of each other's security needs
and how to meet those needs.
</P>
<P>
Peres praised Christopher, who is currently on his 17th
shuttle visit in the region, for his efforts to move forward the
peace process between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He added that the situation is no longer the same as it was
before the negotiations, which had been resumed at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is due to meet separately later this evening with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ehud Barak, and
Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State leaves for Syria tomorrow morning
to hold talks with Syrian President Hafaz Assad, and he is
expected to come back to Israel the next day.

<HEADLINE> Woman Killed in Israeli Bombardments in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Violent Israeli bombardments
in south Lebanon earlier today led to the killing of a
woman and wounding of another at Al-Mansouri village in Sour
area, the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Moslem guerrillas announced that they launched a
series of attacks at positions of the Israeli occupation forces
and their client militia in south Lebanon, causing serious damage
to the positions.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese governmental news agency reported that the
southern Lebanese village of Al-Mansouri was violently bombarded
by Israeli forces from their positions at Balat and Shamaa
at the north sector of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
Amira Mohammed Khashab, 35, was killed in the bombardments,
and Mirfat Ismail Khashab, 25, was wounded, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli military helicopters flew at low altitude
over Nabatiyeh and Marjayoun areas.
</P>
<P>
But military sources noted that today's bombardments did not
go beyond daily bombardments of the Israeli occupation forces
at suspected guerrilla targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a 12-year-old boy named as Faiz
Al-Khafaje was injured by a mine explosion at his village of
Al-Fardis. And the NNA described his situation as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that they launched a series of attacks at the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia inside the
bordering buffer enclave in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
in a statement that one group of its guerrillas ambushed a
SLA patrol this morning near the Al-Hamara crossing point.
</P>
<P>
"The guerrillas rained upon the SLA patrol with machineguns
and anti-tank rockets, killing or wounding a number of the
militiamen," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, other two guerrilla groups attacked SLA
positions at Al-Biyada and Al-Hardun with machineguns and
rockets, causing heavy damage to the targets, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance also said that its guerrillas fired
artilleries at the Israeli position at Tomat Niha before the
dawn and "hit directly" the target.
</P>
<P>
Amal, another Shiite movement competing with Hezbollah in
south Lebanon, announced that its fighters mounted an attack
at Sunday afternoon on an Israeli position at Ali At-Taher.
</P>
<P>
"The fighters used rockets and machineguns in the attack,
which lasted 45 minutes, and in which a number of Israeli
soldiers were killed or wounded, and Israeli warplanes were
witnessed evacuating the wounded from the scene," a statement
issued by Amal said.
</P>
<P>
Amal's another group of guerrillas launched an attack at a SLA
position at Rimat Saidoun on Sunday afternoon, drawing retaliating
bombardments by Israeli forces with cluster shells, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah declared that its military wing, the Islamic
Resistance, carried out in January 41 attacks on the Israeli
occupation forces and their surrogate client the South Lebanon
Army.

<HEADLINE> Major Urged to Get Ulster Election Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major was urged today to hold elections in Northern Ireland as
soon as possible by one of the five main parties in the
conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report this afternoon, the prime minister
had talks here with John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance Party
which is considered to keep a neutral position in Northern Ireland
affairs.
</P>
<P>
But Alderdice support the plans for elections in Ulster
announced by Major as an alternative to the report made by the
international commission in charge of arms decommissioning process
in the province which suggests that the twin-track approach to the
installed peace process agreed by Britain and Ireland last
November be materialized.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Alderdice said that his meeting with Major was
"very encouraging and worthwhile".
</P>
<P>
He said that he had told Major that he had to reassure
nationalists who strive for reunification of the whole island of
Ireland that elections would lead to serious all-party
negotiations on the future of the province.
</P>
<P>
However, the Irish government is still opposed to Britain's
election plans as Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring has
maintained that elections in Ulster would only produce winners and
losers and extend the domination of the province's politics by
unionists who defend British rule over the province.
</P>
<P>
He said last weekend that parties in Northern Ireland were
caught between two views -- "no elections without all-party
negotiations, and no all-party negotiations without elections."
</P>
<P>
He warned that Ulster peace talks were now in danger of
becoming trapped in a vicious circle.

HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Experts should seriously

senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day workshop on population policy
sensitization, the Governor of Midlands Province of central
Zimbabwe, Mahlaba said population experts should check the impact

</P>
<P>
It is estimated one million Zimbabweans are said to be
infected with HIV, which causes the incurable AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mahlaba said rapid population growth has put pressure on
Zimbabwe's land resources, labor market and the provision of
social services, factors which he said have a negative

<HEADLINE> New York Maintenance Workers End Month-Long Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 maintenance
workers in New York City office buildings ended their month-long
strike after a tentative agreement was reached Sunday on a 3-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the current workers will receive a wage
increase of 2.7 percent each year in the contract period. New
fires will have a starting salary of 20 percent below that of the
current workers and it will rise to the level of experienced
workers after two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a result of concessions though both the real
estate industry and the union claimed gains.
</P>
<P>
The management originally demanded a starting salary 48 percent
lower than current salaries which was opposed by the union fearing
that it would encourage management to dismiss veteran workers and
replace them with lower-paid new workers.
</P>
<P>
After the accord, management representatives said that it would
cut their labor and operating costs, while the union officials
boasted that it would provide current workers with a wage increase
above the national and local average.
</P>
<P>
The 35,000 workers, who walked off the job on January 4 after
their previous contract expired, are expected to return to their
jobs today. However the agreement needs to be approved by the
rank-and-file union members.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, the more than 1,000 downtown buildings
including the World Trade Center, the Empire State Building and
Rockefeller Center's skyscrapers, hired replacement workers or
asked office employees to clean up their own trash.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers' returning to their jobs would leave some
15,000 replacement workers jobless.

<HEADLINE> Economists Say They Don't See Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is struggling
with growing unemployment rate and softening performance of retail
sales, but most economists don't see a recession in 1996, it is
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The labor Department reported the country's unemployment rate
rose to 5.8 percent in January from 5.6 percent and 201,000
payroll jobs disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Still, the "USA Today" reported today, that doesn't signal the
beginning of a recession, which used to follow six or more months
of rising unemployment, falling output and weakening spending.
"The consensus is that economy will grow a scant 2 percent this
year," according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that some pessimists are overplaying the
impact of corporate restructuring, the lengthy government
shutdowns and a blizzard in January.
</P>
<P>
"You just don't get a recession when you have strong auto and
truck sales, which we did in December," said Raymond Worseck,
chief economist at A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation is leaving room for the Federal Reserve to push
down interest rates, which is largely regarded as a key to
stimulate the economy. Consumer prices rose just 2.5 percent last
year, a 9-year low. The outlook is for a modest rise in prices
this year.
</P>
<P>
But pessimists counter that there is good reason to be
concerned because the optimists are ignoring key points.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity has fallen six months straight and has
never been this low without a recession, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, not all the January jobs weakness was
weather-related. More than 36 percent of the lost jobs were in
manufacturing, but the National Association of Purchasing
Management found few signs that bad weather disrupted industry
last month. An additional 30 percent of lost jobs were in
temporary positions -- traditionally the first to go in a
recession.

LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain and China today signed a
Memorandum of Understanding on future cooperation on automotive
issues which opens up opportunities for UK motor components
companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Signed by Ian Lang, British trade secretary, and He Guangyuan,
China's minister of Machinery Industry, the agreement is expected
to result in collaborative projects, new joint ventures and
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Lang said that Britain is
committed to playing a full part in developing of the Chinese
automotive industry through the development of long term
relationship, both at government and industry level.
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum marks a further step in cementing the
relationship between the governments and automotive industries of
the UK and the People's Republic of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, it reflects the strong desire of both
countries to cooperate more closely in creating substantial new
business opportunities for UK and Chinese companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came a year after the British Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) launched a joint initiative with the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders to increase the level of
collaboration with China.
</P>
<P>
It was triggered by the DTI's conviction that China will have
become the biggest automotive parts market in the world by 2005.

JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Likud Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu today confirmed that his party and the Tsomet party are
forming a joint list in the next Knesset (Israel's parliament)
elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was speaking to pupil students in Ramat Gan, near
Tel Aviv after he spoke with Tsomet leader Rafael Eitan by
phone.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Eitan are to meet tonight to work on a joint
list. The deal between the two parties is to be initialed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eitan said today that surveys conducted by both the Likud and
Tsomet show that their supporters want the two parties to stand
together in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments to reporters during a Tu B'shvat (the
Jewish holiday for tree planting) tree planting ceremony on the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the director of the Gallup Institute in Israel said
today that three polls have indicated that a joint Likud-Tsomet
list would win more Knesset seats than separated Likud and Tsomet
lists.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the announcement by Netanyahu, Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres wished both parties "good luck," but added
that the Labor Party is not concerned because it is presenting
the electorate with a plan while the opposition is not.

<P>
Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said he believes that the
Likud-Tsomet coalition will add votes to the Labor Party rather
than taking them away.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Yossi Beilin welcomed
the move, calling it "wise" and "healthy development" in the
Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he does not expect a similar agreement
between the Labor and the Meretz party. Both parties are from the
current coalition government.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, who was Foreign Minister in the Likud government
and is quitting the Likud to form his own party, said that the
Likud-Tsomet alliance will strengthen his own party.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Shas party Ariel Deri, a former Interior
Minister in the Rabin government, said he is initiating an effort
to form a united national religious front to compete in the
Knesset elections.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu and Eitan can stay together, so can the religious
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in his opinion, there is room in the Israeli
politics today for only three groupings in the elections, the
right, the left and the religious.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in the Israeli politics come amid
mounting speculation for early elections, which can be advanced
to mid or late May from late October this year.
</P>
<P>
Peres is expected to announce his decision on early elections
in about 10 days' time.

<HEADLINE> Quake Toll in Yunnan Stands at 238 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 238 people were killed
and another 3,800 seriously injured in an earthquake that struck
southwest China's Yunnan Province Saturday evening, according to
the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Some 13,630 people were slightly injured, the province's Deputy
Governor Li Jiating told Xinhua this evening, and, since
aftershocks continue to rock the area, casualties and property
losses continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
More than 332,600 houses and buildings collapsed and 13,400
head of cattle died in Lijiang and Zhongdian counties.
</P>
<P>
An aftershock measuring six on the Richter Scale early this
morning added to Saturday's quake that measured seven on the
Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said that more than 268 aftershocks have been
recorded over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a group of more than 20 foreign tourists were
reportedly blocked at a scenic spot 40 kilometres away from
Lijiang, and that one was seriously hurt and four others suffered
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has instructed local officials to
evacuate the foreign tourists group as soon as possible and to
provide their names, Li said, noting that, in spite of all-out
efforts by the government, the rescue work is hampered by a
shortage of funds and disaster-relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
About 1,550 local army personnel and 350 militiamen have been
searching for survivors for the past 48 hours and a number of
medical teams have been dispatched to the spot, and airlift
efforts have been stepped up to transport victims to other areas
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Since the Red Cross Society of China appealed to the
international community for humanitarian aid on Sunday, the Red
Cross societies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan have provided
about 190,000 U.S. dollars in cash for purchase of emergency
goods.

<HEADLINE> UK's Unqualified Teachers Should Be Sacked: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Feburary 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chief Inspector of
Schools Chris Woodhead said today that 15,000 teachers in England
are so bad that they should be sacked.
</P>
<P>
Woodhead in his annual report issued here said that teaching
standards in nearly half the schools in England are not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
And around one in three lessons in primary schools and one in
five in early secondary schools are +unsatisfactory+.
</P>
<P>
The report expresses particular concern about the teaching of
maths and English in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that up to two million kids are victims
of poor teaching in Britain's state schools.
</P>
<P>
But the report also recommends 200 successful schools and lists
32 outstanding examples.
</P>
<P>
The report says that 48,000 teachers are +excellent+.

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Create a Property Derivatives Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Some of the UK's largest
investment institutions are planning to launch a property
derivatives market in an attempt to put commercial property on an
equal footing with other financial assets.
</P>
<P>
According to a Financial Times report today, The group, which
includes Hermes, The Prudential, Legal &AMP; General, Standard Life,
British Land and National Westminster Bank, etc., is developing a
range of over-the-counter forward contracts.
</P>
<P>
Property has been declining as a proportion of institutional
investment portfolios in Britain for the last 15 years, partly
because buildings are expensive and difficult to trade.
</P>
<P>
However, fund managers believe that index-linked derivative
instruments similar to those available in the equity and bond
markets will help reverse this decline.
</P>
<P>
The Real Estate Index Market planned by the institutions would
cover a range of contracts linked to indices produced by the
Investment Property Data-bank, which measures the performance of
50 billion pounds (75.5 billion US dollars) worth of
institutionally-owned property in the UK.
</P>
<P>
Such instruments would enable property investors to gain
tactical exposure to sectors of the UK property market without
buying buildings. It would also be possible to take short
positions in sectors of the property market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Some solicitors are working on the legal and regulatory aspects
of the proposed instruments. Discussion have also been held with
Reuters, the financial information group, about a possible
screen-based trading system.

<HEADLINE> CNPC Contracts With Ajip and Texaco for Tarim Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), Italy's Ajip, and Texaco of the US signed two
contracts here today to jointly develop oil in the Tarim Basin in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, the area to be explored covers 29,542 sq km
in Xinjiang's Minfeng and Yuntian counties on the south edge of
the basin, bordering the "Tarim-1" block.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the area's prospect for oil exploration are
good, based on surveys and exploration in adjacent blocks.
</P>
<P>
According to terms of the contracts, Ajip will be the operator,
and the two foreign companies will bear the risk alone during the
exploratory period, doing geophysical exploratory work, and
drilling the wells.
</P>
<P>
The contracts last 30 years at most, and specify that when
commercial oil or gas fields are discovered, they will be jointly
invested in and developed by the Chinese and foreign sides.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin is an important area for China's oil
development, and Chinese oil workers have overcome many
difficulties and have made a lot of discoveries there.
</P>
<P>
With a set of basic facilities completed, the Tarim Oilfield is
now able to produce four million tons of crude oil annually.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has expanded foreign co-operation in the last few
years. In 1993, the company offered the southeast part of the
basin for the first international bidding for development, and in
June of 1995, offered the southern part of the basin for the
second-round of bidding.
</P>
<P>
The two contracts mean that the third-round of bidding has
entered the signing stage.
</P>
<P>
Zhou expressed his appreciation for the long-term cooperation
between his company and the two foreign companies, and said that
CNPC will have further opening-up policies and look into new ways
of exploration.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Seeks National Consensus on Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
seeking a national consensus over the 1950 Nepal-India Treaty
prior to the coming visit to New Delhi by Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a talk program on Nepal-India relations, Lohani
said efforts would be made to reach consensus over the 1950 treaty
among major political parties of the country.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the political parties agree in principle on the need
to review the peace and friendship treaty signed between Nepal and
India in 1950, he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has provided for special bilateral relations between
Nepal and India. For example, citizens of one country should be
given national treatment in the other country when conducting
economic activities and they should enjoy privileges in residence,
ownership of property and participation in trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Former Nepali Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari asked for a
review of the treaty during a visit to New Delhi last April.
</P>
<P>
But India has maintained that the treaty would either be
retained entirely or abrogated in accordance with its provisions,
ruling out any possibility of revision.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a joint communique issued at the end of a
visit to Nepal late last month by Indian Minister for External
Affairs Pranab Mukerjee, the governments of Nepal and India will
continue talks on the 1950 treaty issue.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said today that a national consensus over the issue
would make it easier for Prime Minister Deuba to move ahead on
this matter during his week-long visit to India starting Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and Croatian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China is willing to
make constant efforts for the peace process in the former
Yugoslavia along with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the statement during talks here today with his
Croatian counterpart Mate Granic, who arrived here on an official
visit this morning.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers voiced their satisfaction with the
growth of bilateral relations since the two countries established
diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China and Croatia share many common views in
safeguarding sovereignty, promoting the economy, and maintaining
world peace, and that China has consistently supported the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Sino-Croatian ties would increase in
the new situation in which peace is gradually appearing in the
former Yugoslavia, and expressed appreciation for Croatia's "One
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Describing Sino-Croatian relations as a model of international
relations, Granic said Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has
always regarded China as one of Croatia's great friends. Croatia
appreciates China's just stance and balanced policy on issues in
the former Yugoslavia, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Croatia firmly supports China's
territorial integrity, including resuming the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and realizing peaceful
reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said that bilateral economic
cooperation has borne fruit and that they hope the two countries
will continue to expand mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the recent years have seen rapid development of
economic and trade ties and the Chinese government is willing to
work with the Croatian government to encourage big companies and
enterprises to open links for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Granic briefed Qian on recent developments in
the former Yugoslavia, and both men believe that positive changes
have occurred and that the signing of the Bosnia-Hezegovina peace
accord has provided prospects for solving the region's problems.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he appreciates efforts made by the Croatian
government in the Bosnia-Hezegovina peace agreement. He said that
China hopes that all sides concerned will implement it to ensure
peace in the region and resolve the remaining problems through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the states of the former Yugoslavia should be
respected and that he hopes they will recognize each other and
normalize relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rights of ethnic groups in those countries
should be protected, and refugees' desire to return to their
homeland should be respected, and that different nationalities
should live in friendly atmosphere for common development.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two sides signed a consular agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Attacked for "Interference in Elections" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today came once again under fire for "interfering in
the upcoming parliamentary elections" slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akbar Mohtashami, influential leftist clergyman, charged
that Rafsanjani is planning to "control the crucial parliamentary
election in a bid to control the parliament," which will be the
fifth since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Rafsanjani is trying to get his supporters to dominate the
parliament," said Mohtashami in an interview with the weekly
Kayhan Havai published here today.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed Rafsanjani for his interference in the previous
parliamentary elections held in 1992 in which Mohtashami's
faction Association of Combatant Clergy (ACC) was defeated.
</P>
<P>
Mohtashami said although legally the president did not have any
role to play in the elections, Rafsanjani formed his Election
Inspection Group headed by his elder son Mohsen Rafsanjani, which
"was in contravention of the law."
</P>
<P>
Tehran's Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, one of the proteges of
Rafsanjani, also came under attack today for interfering in the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The English language daily Iran News reported that Karbaschi
has been ordered by the Interior Ministry to remove the
pro-Rafsanjani election signs and slogans from public building
walls and bus stations.
</P>
<P>
"The interior minister issued orders that the public places
owned by the Tehran Municipality should, in no way, be used for
or against any group or faction taking part in the parliamentary
elections," Deputy Interior Minister Ali Reza Tabesh was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's mayor is one of the 16 close aides to Rafsanjani, who
have signed two statements so far in support of Rafsanjani's
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The group of ministers and vice-presidents, known as G-16, has
been criticized by the traditional rightists dominating Iran's
parliament for trying to influence the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) controls Iran's fourth
parliament. Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri is one of
the SCC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati is said to have
close links with SCC. The municipalities in Iran are under the
supervision of the Interior Ministry.

<HEADLINE> China Regulation On Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- While loosening its grip on
foreign exchange gradually, China will still maintain strict
controls on hard currency in capital account.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulation on foreign exchange control issued by
the State Council here today, China allows a conditional
convertibility of local currency Renminbi under current account,
meaning that with necessary trade documents, enterprises now can
buy foreign exchanges from designated foreign exchange banks.
</P>
<P>
But enterprises meanwhile must sell their hard currency
earnings to the designated banks or put into bank accounts after
getting approval for opening such accounts. They are not to keep
foreign exchange earnings outside China.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation legalizes what we have done in our sweeping
reform on foreign exchange system since 1994," said a spokesman
from the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC). "It gives
a strong push to the smooth expansion of foreign trade as well as
the full convertibility of Renminbi under current account."
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investors can remit profit, dividend and
interest earnings outside China from their foreign exchange
accounts or convert their Renminbi earnings into hard currency in
designated banks before they remit the money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The regulation which will become effective as of April 1st says
that Chinese residents can hold their foreign exchanges, or put
them into banks or sell them to the banks on a voluntary
basis. But no private trading is allowed.
</P>
<P>
The SAEC spokesman said that while relaxing control on foreign
exchange under current account, China will continue its strict
control on foreign exchange management under capital account.
</P>
<P>
China has to further improve its macro regulation capability
and it still lacks an effective mechanism of foreign exchange
control.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see chaoses caused by capital inflows and
outflows in huge amount at the stage when we are weak in
controling method," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Search for Abductors' Hideout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) launched a search for the hideout of the Free Papua
Movement (OPM) abductors in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The local security authorities began the search late last week
together with local villagers, according to an Antara report
today, quoting Jayawijaya Military District Commander Sumertha
Ayub as revealing the operation today in Jayapura, capital of
Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Ayub assured that ABRI will remain to be
non-confrontational in their approach in seeking the release of
the hostages who had been abducted by OPM on January 8.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 people including seven foreigners on
January 8 and 13 of them were released later.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the OPM hideout is located somewhere near
the Mapanduma village on the border of Indonesia and Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Ayub explained that the search for the OPM hideout was one of
the basic options left after OPM ceased its radio contact with the
ABRI.

<HEADLINE> Capriati Returns to Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- American teenager Jennifer
Capriati will return to tennis next week after an absence of more
than a year, organisers of the Paris Women's Open said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 19, who has not played competitive tennis since
November 1994, has been given a wild card to take part in the
Paris tournament which starts on February 13.
</P>
<P>
Organisers said Capriati, the reigning Olympic women's
champion, had asked for a wild card, saying she felt physically
and mentally ready to return to the sport after recovering from
personal problems, including drugs, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Capriati turned professional at the age of 14 in a blaze of
publicity suggesting she could follow in the footsteps of other
prodigies who went on to become tennis superstars, such as Chris
Evert, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
But, suffering from early burn-out after making the top 10 in
the rankings at the age of 16, she was arrested for shoplifting in
December 1993 and went out of the game for almost a year before
making one tournament appearance at Philadelphia and then
disappearing again.
</P>
<P>
In between, she was arrested for possessing drugs and has
spent time in drug rehabilitation centers.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee crashed to a
record low of 37.85/38.00 per US dollar at the close of trading in
the Forex market in Mumbai (Bombay), despite modest central bank
intervention in support of the unit.
</P>
<P>
The Indian currency has depreciated by nearly 1.13 rupees in a
single session today and by 2.75 rupees in the current year.
</P>
<P>
The currency had fallen to an abysmal low of 38.10 rupees
during the course of trading on incessant corporate dollar demand
and panic import covering, but later staged a mild rally.
</P>
<P>
Opening steady around its weekend levels of 36.78/82 per
dollar, the rupee gradually dropped to 36.90/95. The Reserve Bank
of India then intervened briefly by selling the US dollar but it
had no impact on the market and the rupee quickly breached
37-rupee per dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank withdrew from the market and the rupee
nose-dived and pierced through the 38-rupee per dollar level on an
avalanche of dollar buying by corporates and importers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Eager to Better Relations with East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has claimed that it is
eager to establish better relations with the East in a bid to
thwart the international isolation move launched by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that Iran's
foreign policy was gradually being directed toward promoting
ties with countries such as Russia and China in order to
safeguard its independence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with today's issue of the right-wing weekly
Sobh, Velayati said developing ties with non-Western countries
would "guarantee the independence of the country."
</P>
<P>
He revealed for the first time that it is Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei who is in charge of defining this country's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention what kind of role President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani has played in defining the foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The importance and sensitiveness of the foreign policy
mandated that the Leader would always monitor this area," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Iran had worked hard in the past four years to
developing ties with non-Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"What we have done in our relations with such countries as
China, Russia, Japan and Southeast Asian countries, the countries
in the Subcontinent (India and Pakistan) and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union in the Central Asia
and the Caucasus is almost unprecedented and everyone can see that
we are progressing," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati admitted that there are obstacles in Iran
along the path of advancing relations with the non-Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the officials from different government organizations
have to be convinced that Iran needs to develop ties with the East.
</P>
<P>
"In different areas, you have to convince the executives about
this change of direction. " he said.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that the economic and industrial infrastructure of
the country is essentially Western.
</P>
<P>
"The technology that has emerged in Iran is essentially
Western. We have mainly done trade with the West," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the sale of oil and non-oil products is also
another factor which defined Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have to sell 2.6 million barrels of oil per day and spend
its revenue on the country's development. Do you look in
countries like China and Russia for buyers when Russia, for
example, is selling its oil?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said non-Western countries could not provide the
much-needed cash for Iran's economy and most non-Western countries
required Iran to barter its oil for their goods.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iran welcomed relations with any Western
country that wanted to have ties based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"Relatively speaking, we can mention countries such as Germany,
France, Italy, Spain and Austria that have reached the conclusion
that their ties with us should be based on mutual respect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that even though Germany was Iran's number
one trade partner, the relations between the two countries have
had their ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's relationship with other European countries are plagued
by European criticism of Iran's human rights records, the death
sentence on Rushdie, international terrorism and pursuit of
nuclear weaponry," an expert at the Iranian Foreign Ministry told
Xinhua on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the main problem is not because Iran is a
religious country.
</P>
<P>
"Our main problem is that we have decided to adopt a policy
that would threaten the Western hegemony in the region," he
said.

JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called for a proper management of the fishing industry when
meeting the chief of the Association of Indonesian Fishermen, Tuk

</P>

He said that proper management could be achieved through

</P>
<P>
Soeharto noted that the fishing industry is one of the sectors
with slower pace of development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to overhaul the management of the fishing
industry to prevent foreign competitors from entering into
Indonesia's waters and exploiting its marine resources, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also called for significant assistance to enable
traditional fishermen to acquire modern fiber glass fishing boats.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Improve State Trading Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today urged state trading companies, which used to import capital
and consumer goods for the government, to take part in the export
drive.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the president on the performance of 62
state-owned companies under his ministry, Indonesian Trade and
Industry Minister Tungky Ariwibowo told the press today that the
government has planned to set up an international marketing
network for such companies.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering some deregulation measures
for the state companies which are being studied for possible
merger, in the fields of management, finance and capital
structure, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the deregulation measures will enable the
state companies to make progress in the performance of their
duties and to have flexibility in carrying out their business
activities, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
On the performance of the 62 state trading companies, the
minister said that 53 of them have made profits of more than one
trillion rupiah (about 500 million US dollars), while the rest
suffered losses.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that those state trading companies that are
operating soundly will be directed to sell their shares at the
stock market at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
As for the unhealthy companies, "if there is no prospect, then
there is no reason to maintain it," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Discovered in Vietnamese Rubies: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have confirmed the
existence of diamond in Vietnamese rubies, once thought a
geological impossibility, the official Vietnam News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has special geological conditions which allow the
formation of tiny grains of diamond in ruby stones, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, by a group of three Vietnamese scientists, was
presented to the Vietnam Sciences Institute in Hanoi last Friday,
and may be published in the international scientific magazine
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The research began in Paris after the Vietnamese scientists
took ruby samples from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Diamond is formed either deep under the ground in volcanos of
kimberlite formation, as in Southern Africa, or is formed as a
result of the impact of moving continental shelves below the
earth's crust colliding.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's geological history suggests it was pushed
southeastward by movements in the earth's crust and the formation
of the Red River and its surrounding delta was the result of
tectonic movements.
</P>
<P>
Similar collisions are believed to have occurred in China's
northeastern region and in the Ural mountains that separate Asia
from Europe, one of the Vietnamese researchers explained.
</P>
<P>
Ruby mining started by chance in Vietnam in the mid-1970s when
some wood cutters in the central provinces of Ha Tinh and Nghe An
discovered some beautiful looking stones in the jungle. Out of
curiosity, they took them to private goldsmiths in Hanoi who made
their fortune by buying them for a very small sum.
</P>
<P>
The wood cutters' discovery triggered a rush for rubies in the
two provinces and then in the northern mountainous province of Yen
Bai.
</P>
<P>
Later Vietnamese scientists were allowed to take ruby samples
to Paris for laboratory tests, which led to the new discovery.

<HEADLINE> Daily Needs Given Priority in Quake Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
today urged local government in south China's earthquake-stricken
area to make every effort to satisfy local peoples' daily needs.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that it is
imperative that basic food, clothing, housing, and medical care
needs of those living in the area be attended to.
</P>
<P>
Wu arrived in the quake-stricken area in southwest China's
Yunnan Province yesterday to direct rescue operations and show the
central authorities' concern for the quake victims.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring seven on the Richter Scale, rocked
Lijiang and Zhongdian counties in northwestern Yunnan two days
ago, killing at least 233 people, and causing extensive property
damage.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that central authorities have been very much concerned
about the situation, and that both the local government and the
army have made great efforts in disaster-relief work, and called
on local residents to overcome their difficulties and return
things to normal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
At present, rescue operations are in full swing under the
direction of relief headquarters headed by Provincial Governor He
Zhiqiang.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 local army soldiers and 350 militiamen have been
sent to help with the rescue work. A number of medical teams have
been sent or are on the way to the site.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is located on a major fault line between the Eurasian
and Pacific Rim tectonic plates, and is one of China's most
seismically active regions, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1930, three earthquakes measuring six or above on the
Richter Scale have been recorded in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision to send
emergency food aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
was purely humanitarian and had no political implications, a
senior White House official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting National Security Advisor Anthony Lake told South
Korean government ministers and officials that the U.S. would not
provide any additional aid to the DPRK without Seoul's consent.
</P>
<P>
He said the two million U.S. dollars of aid sent through the
World Food Program (WFP) to the DPRK was a small-scale, symbolic
and purely humanitarian gesture to the country to help ease food
shortages caused by floods last year.
</P>
<P>
Lake, who arrived in South Korea on February 3 for a four-day
visit held talks with South Korean Deputy Prime Minister and
National Unification Board Minister Kwon O-kie, Foreign Minister
Gong Ro-myung and Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and
National Security Yoo Chong-ha.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed coordinating their policies on the
Korean Peninsula and on food aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy on the DPRK will be directed at contributing to
a thaw in inter-Korean relations, Lake said, adding that his
country supports South Korea's efforts to resume inter-Korean
dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit Slashed in November 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Anwar Ibrahim said here today
that the country's trade deficit in November 1995 was slashed to
49.2 million Malaysian ringgit (about 19.68 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure was down from October's deficit of 1.6 billion
ringgit (about 640 million US dollars), he told the press.
</P>
<P>
According to Anwar, Malaysia was confident that the current
account, which previously stood at 7.2 billion US dollars, was not
as bad as painted by some speculators.
</P>
<P>
For November 1995, Malaysia's free on board export rose 23.1
percent to 17.0392 billion ringgit (about 6,815 million US
dollars) while imports on the cost, insurance and freight basis
rose 23.7 percent to 17.0884 billion ringgit (about 6,835 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit has been much talked about in
economic and financial circles after Malaysia's trade deficit
ballooned to 1.6 billion ringgit (about 640 million US dollars) in
October.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here said that the huge trade deficit in October
would bring the country's current account deficit to 20 billion
ringgit (about 8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The country's economic fundamentals continue to be strong and
investors should not be easily influenced by such predictions,"
said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the deficit situation was worrying, Anwar said
the government had full confidence that the country's economic
growth would be sustained.

<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition parties
today announced a fresh anti-government agitation program
including a nationwide 48-hour general strike on February 14-15.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the program at a press conference here this

The opposition leader reiterated the demand for immediate
resignation of the prime minister and organizing a neutral
caretaker government to supervise the general elections.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Ready for Sea Link Talks With Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The mainland is fully prepared
to hold talks with Taiwan on opening of a direct sea link across
the Taiwan Straits, China's minister of Communications said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong made the remark at a forum marking the first
anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's speech on China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that the economic and trade boom across the Taiwan
Straits has created stronger demands for direct transportation
between the mainland and Taiwan island, and that the Ministry of
Communications made it clear in 1979 that merchant ships from
Taiwan are welcome at open ports on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the ministry put forward its "one China, two-way
direct traffic, and mutual benefits" principle in dealing with
direct shipping across the Straits, Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that direct shipping between the
mainland and Taiwan should be handled within the one China
principle, and that markets on both sides of the Straits should be
developed by shipping businesses, and that no conditions or
political restraints should be placed on mail service, trade, and
air and shipping services across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, a good foundation has been laid for direct
sea links after years of friendly exchanges and the mainland
supports the fourth symposium to be held sometime this year, in
the hope that a plan for direct shipping services can be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the shipping industry, such as the president
of China Ocean Shipping Co., also voiced support for the opening
of direct sea links between the mainland and Taiwan as early as
possible, at today's forum.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian skiier Werner Perathoner
notched up his first World Cup victory of the season in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany on Monday in a demanding super
giant slalom halted three times because of piste problems.
</P>
<P>
Perathoner, whose only other World Cup victory came in a
super-G in the Norwegian resort of Kvitfjell last season, took
advantage of a high starting number to finish the 1.36 km course
in one minute, 19.62 seconds, according to provisional results.
</P>
<P>
France's Luc Alphand, who won the downhill on Friday, was
second in 1:19.83, with Austria's Patrick Wirth third in 1:20.05
in the last super-G before world championships in Sierra Nevada
later this month.
</P>
<P>
All three skiers went down the course before the race was
interrupted for the first time for five minutes after the 11th
starter because the piste was breaking up.
</P>
<P>
Later skiers had to put up with further 15-minute and
35th-minute breaks while officials worked hard to fix the
problem. Times were much slower following the second break after
the 16th racer, as the sun came out.
</P>
<P>
The course was made difficult by bumpy snow -- icy in some
parts, sticky in others -- and the gates were very tight.
</P>
<P>
Leading skiers like Norway's Super-G World Cup leader Atle
Skaardal and compatriot Lasse Kjus, the overall World Cup leader,
crashed out after missing games.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown On Money Forgers and Smugglers Called For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily," in a
commentary to be carried tomorrow, warns that those who seek to
profit by counterfeiting money or by smuggling forged notes should
be aware of the danger now, otherwise they will meet with the same
end as those convicted today.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court announced that five persons who
smuggled in counterfeit money were executed today, and that more
than 20 others in two separate cases were given penalties ranging
from three years in prison to life.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the Supreme People's Court to
publicize such cases of counterfeiting and smuggling, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The criminals involved deserved the punishment for breaking
the law," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The crimes harm the national interest and the people's
livelihood, have an adverse effect on the state's dignity, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
The renminbi, China's official currency, is under strict legal
control, but as the country's overall strength and international
reputation increases, money crimes have become more widespread,
with bigger sums involved and plots more complicated, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
China's economic construction needs a good economic order and
social stability, it says, and all illegal activities in finance
will be dealt with in strict accordance with the law.

unanimous decision.
</P>

his long arms from every angle but without enough steam to upset
the unbeaten Russian.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong opened its first
marine traffic control station at Ma Wan at Gemini Point today,
according to the Marine Department.
</P>
<P>
Ian Dale, director of the department, said that the
radar-equipped marine traffic control station operates round
clock. It embodies a full communication capability to the main
Vessels Traffic Control Center in Sheung Wan and a control launch
under the station's direct command.
</P>
<P>
Dale said that the station is just one in a large program of
marine traffic management initiatives to enhance Hong Kong's
vessel traffic services into the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department had increasingly looked to advances
in technology to improve the monitoring of ship movements and
enable rapid responses to potential problems on sea.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 the Marine Department set up the Vessel Traffic System
(VTS) which enables comprehensive radar coverage of the movements
of large vessels over most of Hong Kong waters.
</P>
<P>
In localized traffic conflict areas where river trade vessels
and ferries converge with ocean-going ships, there is a need to
supplement the VTS radar coverage with the ability to segregate
smaller vessels from ocean ships.
</P>
<P>
The department has plans for similar facilities to be
established at Kwai Chung, Green Island and Mirs Bay over the next
few years.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Maternal Mortality Underestimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of women dying every
year during pregnancy or childbirth has been substantially
underestimated, with nearly 80,000 more deaths each year than
previously reported.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide maternal deaths had previously been estimated at
about 500,000 a year, but a two-year joint study by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), shows the true figure some 16 per cent higher at 585,000.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said maternal mortality had been underestimated by
nearly one third in Eastern, Central and Western Africa. And
mortality rates were higher than previously believed throughout
the world apart from in the five sub-regions of Northern and
Southern Africa, Eastern Asia, Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
The maternal mortality rate is difficult to assess, since only
78 of the WHO's 190 members, covering some 35 percent of the
world's population, make a routine report of the cause of death,
said the study.
</P>
<P>
Almost all deaths during pregnancy or childbirth take place in
developing countries, with more than half of the total registered
in Asia, which accounts for 61 percent of the world's births.
</P>
<P>
The situation is even worse in Africa, which has only 20
percent of the world's births but makes up 40 percent of all
maternal deaths.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, developed nations, with 11 percent of all births,
report less than 1 percent of maternal deaths.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries as a whole, maternal death rates range
from under 2 per 1,000 live births in Latin America and the
Caribbean to nearly 9 in Africa. It reaches 10 per 1,000 in
Eastern and Western Africa.
</P>
<P>
The highest maternal death rate is reported in Sierra Leone
with 18 in every 1,000 live births, followed by Afghanistan with
17, while European countries, such as Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland, see the lowest figures.
</P>
<P>
The risk of pregnancy-related death is 100 times greater in
sub-Saharan Africa than in Europe, the study shows.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old armed policeman
suspected of murdering senior official Li Peiyao on February 2 was
arrested today by Beijing's public securities bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinlong, who was one of Li's bodyguards, admitted killing
63-year-old Li Peiyao, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee

house, but was discovered in the act.
</P>
<P>
When the suspect attempted to flee the scene of the crime with
things he had taken from Li's house, he was stopped by two other
guards on duty.
</P>
<P>
Zhang came from north China's Shanxi Province and joined the
armed police in December of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Five Executed for Smuggling Counterfeit Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two people from Taiwan province
and three from Guangdong province were executed today for
smuggling counterfeit money from Taiwan to Guangdong, a senior
judge announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In what was called the biggest case of smuggled renminbi,
China's official currency, 33 million yuan in counterfeit notes
were brought from Taiwan in 1994 during a four-month period, and
14 million worth were put into circulation, according to Liu
Jiachen, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The executions were carried out in Shanwei city of Guangdong
this morning. Two of the men, aged 35 and 44, were captains of
Taiwan fishing boats. Those from the mainland were Xu Jinkuang,
33, Lu Yisheng, 32, and Su Huoming, 33.
</P>
<P>
Seven other persons involved in the case were given life and
other prison sentences, in addition to fines.
</P>
<P>
The senior judge also released information about another
forgery case, in which 24 persons were found guilty, in Central
China's Henan Province, where 510,000 yuan was counterfeited and
more than 400,000 yuan in false notes were bought from somewhere
else, since October 1991.
</P>
<P>
The chief culprits of the crime, a 45-year-old self-employed
woman, Cui Xiurong, and a middle school teacher, Cui Changguo, 31,
were sentenced to life imprisonment and had their political rights
suspended for life. The others involved were given prison terms
ranging from three to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that, in recent years, counterfeiting, smuggling, and
dealing forged notes have occurred with greater frequency and have
spread to a larger number of areas.
</P>
<P>
China's laws provide for the death penalty for trafficking in
counterfeit money, and the top legislature raised the maximum
penalty for counterfeiting to the death sentence from life
imprisonment in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Chinese courts will do their best to deal harshly
with crimes relating to money and to curb the trend in financial
crimes, and provide judicial backing for the country's financial
order and social stability.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restates Burkina Faso's Complicity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has restated Burkina
Faso's complicity in the plot to destabilise the Nigerian
government in collaboration with Nigeria's dissident political
organisation, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement yesterday in capital Abuja, Nigerian Minister
of Special Duties Alhaji Wada Nas said evidence indicting the
Burkina Faso government involvement in the plot included the
frequency of secret missions of the NADECO-abroad in Ouagadougou,
the capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
"In addition", Nas said, "there are confirmed reports of some
NADECO leaders abroad travelling with Burkinabe (Burkinese)
diplomatic passports."
</P>
<P>
He said a senator Bola Tinubu was reported to have approached
the South African Embassy in London for a visa, using a Burkinese
diplomatic passport.
</P>
<P>
Granting such diplomatic facilities to Nigerian dissidents, he
said, "cannot be viewed as a friendly act since, from records
available, Nigeria does not regard herself as being in a state of
war with any African nation, Burkina Faso inclusive."
</P>
<P>
Nas said Nigeria regarded any collaboration between any nation
and Nigerian citizens "who have openly declared war on their
fatherland" as an unfriendly and confrontational act that could
undermine the sovereignty of Nigeria and jeorpadise whatever
friendly relationship that exists between such country and
Nigeria.  enditem

<HEADLINE> China Sweep Four Short-track Golds in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese skaters
overcame more fancied South Koreans to sweep all four short-track
gold medals at the Asian Winter Games here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang, the only Chinese in the six-skater-final of the
women's 1,500 meters, dipped home first to beat world champion
Chun Lee-Kyung of South Korea by two hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
Yang timed two minutes 28.93 seconds to win China's first
gold.
</P>
<P>
Chun, also the 3,000 meters world champion, slipped with just
half meter to go to pick the silver medal, while her teammate Kun
Yun-Mi, Asian champion both in 1,500 and 3,000 meters, was third
at 2:29.02.
</P>
<P>
Four South Koreans reached the final. Besides Chun and Kun,
there were Won Hye-Kyung and 1,500 meters world record holder Kim
So-Hee. The other finalist was Japanese Sachi Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the standard version, in which athletes race against
the clock on 400-meter ovals, the short-track races have up to
six skaters maneuvering for position through tight turns on a
111-meter track. Race strategy can be more important than times.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean short-trackers are known for their teamwork
and experience. For less fancied Yang, to beat them was almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
Kim So-Hee quickened her pace in the second lap, in an obvious
purpose of wearing out two non-South-Korean skaters. Then Kim
Yun-Mi took over as a leader, skating much faster.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean tactical skating ended with two laps to go
after Kim So-Hee slipped and withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
The three South Koreans, who all wanted to be champion,
scrambled in a tight turn, while Yang edged her way out of the
turn to skate shoulder-to-shoulder with Chun. Yang dipped first
while Chun lost her balance at the finish.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Li Jiajun became the first double-titlist after winning
the men's 1,500 and 500 meters races.
</P>
<P>
Li clocked 2:30.32 to win the 1,500 final, edging South Korea's
world champion Chae Ji-Hoon by 0.18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Chae took the silver medal while his teammate Lee Jun-Hwan got
the bronze in 2:30.55.
</P>
<P>
Li then clinched the 500 meters title with a new Asian record
time of 43.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kun Dong-Soung finished second in 44.61 and
Chinese Zhang Hongbo was third at 44.69.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunlu led a Chinese 1-2-3 finish in the women's 500
meters final.
</P>
<P>
Wang clocked 46.55 seconds to come first, followed by Sun Dan
in 46.67.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang, the namesake of the 1,500 meters winner, finished
third in 47.14.

<HEADLINE> Indian FM Says Scandal May Affect Ruling Party's  Election Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today that the Hawala pay-off
scandal may affect the prospects of the ruling Congress Party in
the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a five-year-old 18 million US dollars
bribery scandal involving a number of high-ranking officials in
the government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India, the minister
nevertheless insisted that it was too early to predict what would
be the impact of the Hawala case on the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala issue had more than one dimension and it would be
too simplistic to say that this party has lost and that party has
won after the scandal, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainty, Mukherjee expressed confidence that
the ruling Congress Party would remain in power after the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the dates of the polls, the minister said that the
elections would probably be held in late April.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Inspects PLA Troops to Be Assigned to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) troops to be stationed in Hong Kong should build, with
their deeds, an image of being full of power and civility when
they are garrisoned in Hong Kong from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, during his first
inspection of the PLA troops to be stationed in Hong Kong on
December 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the company of Major-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the
PLA Hong Kong Troops, and Political Commissar Xiong Ziren, Jiang
visited an infantry company and inquired about the daily lives and
training of the troops.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection the general secretary said that it is
only 500-odd days from China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong. The troops shoulder a glorious yet
arduous task entrusted by the country and the Party, he reminded
them.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected them to make special contributions to the
garrison of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Citing the consistent concern shown by Jiang Zemin for these
troops, a Xinhua report said the general secretary scrutinized a
report on the formation of the PLA Hong Kong Troops on October 2,
1990 and gave his first instruction: The most important thing for
the PLA Hong Kong Troops is to be perfect politically.
</P>
<P>
Since the formation of this contingent in early 1993 Jiang has
made a series of directions governing various aspects of the
troops, especially the quality of its members.
</P>
<P>
When the PLA Hong Kong Troops, consisting of ground, naval and
air forces, took shape in 1994, Jiang repeatedly told Liu Huaqing
and Zhang Zhen, vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission,
the PLA Hong Kong Troops should have a clear understanding that
garrisoning Hong Kong is different from entering Shanghai in the
early liberation days.
</P>
<P>
China is to act in accordance with the principle of "one
country, two systems" when it resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong in 1997, and Hong Kong will be run by Hong Kong
residents themselves, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forward a set of criteria for the PLA Hong Kong
Troops when he attended a panel discussion at the third session of
the Eighth National People's Congress held in March 1995, stating
that the troops should be first-rate in political and ideological
education, military training, discipline and management.

<HEADLINE> HK SFC Drafts New Plan to Maintain Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission today unveiled a corporate plan for the coming
three years in a bid to maintain its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
It is the third work plan since the commission was set up in
May 1989.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission said today that the primary aim
of the plan is to ensure that Hong Kong keeps pace with the
rapidly changing environment to maintain its competitive edge as a
leading financial market, as Hong Kong becomes a Special
Administrative Region of China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 key initiatives and tasks have been identified in
the plan to enable the Hong Kong market to meet the challenges
ahead and to benefit fully from the opportunities that will be
present in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The work plan also provides a backdrop for adjustments to the
regulatory framework in the face of the changing operating
environment, such as the expansion of regional markets,
technological advancement, growing sophistication and higher
expectations of investors, and greater availability of computer
trading systems offering overseas products to investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the major accomplishments of the commission in the past
six years had reformed the regulatory regime and market
infrastructure, and helped restore investors' confidence in the
Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
A slight adjustment to the current functional structure is
being implemented to enable the commission to effectively carry
out the work plan, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: New Jordanian PM -- Man of Perseverance, Flexibility (by Wen Xinnian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Abdul Karim Kabariti, sworn in
as Jordanian new prime minister Sunday, is a U.S.-educated liberal
having close ties with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, 46, from a leading Jordanian political and business
family, attained a degree in business administration and financial
management from Saint Edwards University-Austin, in Texas and was
a licensed financial adviser in New York until 1986.
</P>
<P>
Married to Fatina Madi and a father of two, Kabariti entered
the cabinet in 1989 for the first time and acted as tourism
minister till 1992 when he was appointed as minister of labor.
</P>
<P>
Before he was appointed as foreign minister of Sharif Zeid Ben
Shaker's government on January 8, 1995, Kabariti helped endorse
the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in August, 1994 when he
was Chairman of the Lower House of Parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, during the past year, changed significantly Jordan's
long-standing foreign policy toward Iraq, quickened the steps of
normalization of ties with Israel and bettered the Kingdom's
relations with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti won full support of King Hussein, although his
cabinet colleagues and opposition parties accused him of improving
Jordanian-Saudi ties at the expense of its traditional relations
with Iraq and were dissatisfied with his enthusiasm of promoting
full normalization with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Saudi ties became soured for Jordan's stance
toward Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The king's appreciation of his perseverance dates far back to
1971, when he headed the Jordanian Students Association at the
American University of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old student of geology was so effective in
resisting an overwhelming pro-Nasserite wave at the university
that he was finally kidnaped by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, in the first political kidnaping in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His release was soon secured through the King's mediation with
the Lebanese power-brokers.
</P>
<P>
The King, who was greatly impressed by this young man's
determination to defend the then embattled monarchy, received him
at the airport upon his return to Amman and awarded him a medal
for his bravery.
</P>
<P>
As foreign minister, Kabariti maintained a high-profile
performance while some of his colleagues kept their distance from
the post-Gulf War policies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attribute his performance to his long association
with the palace's political vision and unusual manoeuvring style
that combines diplomacy with bluntness.
</P>
<P>
His style, particularly some critical statements against both
Syria and Iraq, has provoked severe criticism from many
politicians who were wary that Jordan's new closeness to Israel
would lead to estrangement form its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
His performance, some local press noted, singled him out as
the most outspoken defender of the new policies which focuses on
strengthen the kingdom's role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media reported that he also showed a high
level of flexibility and adaptability as many politicians found
it extremely difficult to give up ideals that emanated from
commitment to pan-Arab nationalism and to the attainment of all
Palestinian national rights.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Jordan Times today argued that
Kabariti's rapid political rise is not by chance, but an
inevitable outcome of his aggressive performance in promoting
Jordan's foreign policies in the post-Gulf War era and of his
perseverance and flexibility.

<HEADLINE> Guinean President Took Over As Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Guinean President Lansana
Conte, lucky enough to have escaped a military coup, said in a
radio broadcast to the nation today that he had taken over the
post of defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Minister Colonel Abdul Diallo was sacked
on Saturday, one day after the coup, according to the radio
report monitored here today.
</P>
<P>
"Calm has returned to Conakry. And there were no report of
fighting in other parts of the country," said President Conte.
</P>
<P>
He said utility workers are now clearing parts of the burnt-out
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Local sources in the Guinean capital said businesses are now
functioning amid tension which is now still reigning the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
"Directors of many government departments ramsacked by
rampaging soldiers last Friday are now assessing the damage,"
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Border guards said the international airport in Conakry was
reopened on Sunday but no flight arrived as they were all
cancelled. Some journalists flew from Abidjan to Freetown and
crossed into Guinea by road.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 soldiers of the Guinean army started their rampage
for pay increases on Friday. But President Conte called it a
"coup d'etat" with the sole aim to oust him.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people, mostly civilians, were killed but independent
sources said the death toll could be as high as 50 with some 70
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, also in a radio broadcast to the nation, President
Conte promised pay increases for the soldiers starting from this
February.
</P>
<P>
"I am also giving you rice to assist you. Let us bring peace
again to our country and disappoint our enemies who would like to
see us fight each other," he was quoted by the radio as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Lloyd's of London has confirmed
it had sold its headquarters in the City of London to Deutsche
Sparkassen Immobilien Anlage (Despa), a German property fund, the
British media reported today.
</P>
<P>
A provisional contract has been exchanged for the Corporation
of Lloyd's to sell the steel and glass building, one of the City's
best-known landmarks, to Despa, which will lease it back to
Lloyd's for just under 12 million pounds (18 million U.S. dollars)
a year.
</P>
<P>
Despa is believed to have paid about 180 million pounds (274
million U.S. dollars) for the building, a price roughly equals the
sum Lloyd's spent on the building 10 years ago when it was
completed.
</P>
<P>
The sale still has to be approved by Lloyd's ruling council,
which meets on Wednesday and David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, will
be contacting other council members today to seek approval for the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's took the decision last May to sell the building as part
of a program to raise funds for the rescue package for
debt-stricken members. It said it had held talks with four
interested parties, including two from the UK, before agreeing the
Despa deal.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Withdraw from World Cup Match in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia decided on Monday
that they would withdraw from their World Cup cricket match in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
As the Australian Cricket Board decision not to send the team
for the February 17 match against Sri Lanka reverberated around
the cricketing world, skipper Mark Taylor and other leading
players said it would be worth sacrificing the two points.
</P>
<P>
ACB chairman Denis Rogers said there were legitimate fears for
player safety after last Wednesday's bomb attack in Colombo which
made at least 86 dead and 1,400 injured.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off close to the hotel to be used by the
Australian players, who have also received death threats in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ACB asked for the venue of the group A qualifying match to
be changed, but the World Cup organisers have stuck by Sri Lanka
and it seems Australia will have to forfeit the match if they do
not turn up.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Sydney, Australian skipper Taylor said: "I don't
like to give in to anything, but I don't see that we should be
pawns in this game either.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan cricket authorities said they hoped Australia
would change their minds, but Taylor commented: "While there's
time there's always hope, but the Board has made a unanimous
decision today, supported by the players, and it'll take a lot to
turn that around in 13 days."
</P>
<P>
The ACB chairman said the board appreciated assurances given by
Sri Lanka but added: "We gave considerable thought to all the
information we had before us.
</P>
<P>
"It was important for them (the players) to know that their
board, in consultation with them, was prepared to ensure that
their safety was our highest priority."
</P>
<P>
Organisers in New Delhi said all four matches scheduled to be
held in Sri Lanka would stay there.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Opposition Parties to Form Election Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli opposition
parties, the Likud and Tsomet, have reached agreement on
establishing a united electoral bloc for the upcoming elections,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli elections were scheduled for October this year and
are likely to be advanced to May.
</P>
<P>
Though neither party would officially confirm the report, some
sources said that the deal has been struck and the agreement is to
be initialed this week.
</P>
<P>
The parties will not merge, but will be fielding a single
Knesset (Israel's parliament) ticket and will both back Likud
Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu for premier.
</P>
<P>
After the elections, the parties will have the option of
remaining together in a united parliamentary bloc or going their
separate ways and setting up their own Knesset factions.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Tsomet leader Rafael Eitan will not run
for prime minister, but will get the second spot on the joint
ticket, and Tsomet will get eight slots in the first 40.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two parties resulted chiefly from
Likud efforts to end Eitan's candidacy for premier, which
Netanyahu viewed as particularly detrimental to his chances
against Shimon Peres, Israeli Prime Minister and Chairman of the
Labor party.
</P>
<P>
The key to the allocation of slots is the number of seats won
in 1992 by the two parties, the Likud won 32 Knesset seats, and
Tsomet started the present term with eight.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hammered out in a series of clandestine
meetings by Likud Director-General Avigdor Lieberman and Tsomet
Director-General Doron Shmueli.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that besides removing Eitan from the
prime ministerial race, the agreement is geared to giving the
opposition parties in the Knesset a morale boost, and its actual
electoral value is hard to gauge.
</P>
<P>
Tsomet had in past campaigns nibbled at Labor's support, and it
is not clear whether its potential electorate would fully follow
it into a partnership with the Likud, and whether those with a
Labor past would vote for Likud-led list.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, news of the deal may also cause internal problems in
the Likud, where the primary race for safe slots on the Knesset
list is very crowded.
</P>
<P>
At this point, no one knows where the Tsomet candidate will be
placed and how far down on the list the Tsomet newcomers would
push the very hard-pressed Likud contestants.

<HEADLINE> 3.2 Million People to Leave Jakarta for Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- About 3.2 million people are
expected to leave Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, to celebrate the
Idul Fitri post-fasting festivity in their home towns.
</P>
<P>
The number of the people moving within the country before and
after the holiday is expected to reach 63 million, of which about
43 million are expected to use land transport means like buses
and trains, Director General for Land Transport Soejono told the
local press today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in anticipation of the moving rate during this
year's festivity, both state and private-run transport companies
are called upon to provide sufficient buses and coaches.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of travelers from Jakarta during the
post-fasting festivity reached some three million, or about one
third of the capital city's population of nine million.
</P>
<P>
To transport the big number of travelers, the city
administration has increased the number of buses, prepared several
temporary bus terminals which will be equipped with various
facilities such as health and information posts.
</P>
<P>
For the special season, the government would give a special
treatment for holiday travelers.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest Muslim-populated country in the world, 90
percent of the Indonesia's 195 million people are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Idul Fitri festivity following the fasting month is the
most important holiday for the Muslims which falls on February 20.
 It is the tradition for the Muslims to return to home towns to
celebrate the holiday with their family members.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind is set to call for a fresh drive to liberalize
trade between the European Union (EU) and North America.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a forum of the Transatlantic Policy Network on
Tuesday, Rifkind is expected to hail Britain's role as the nation
"forcing the pace" in the EU, The Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
He will emphasize that political and defense relations between
the EU and North America can best be strengthened by focusing on
projects offering economic benefits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We must apply the transatlantic partnership to further our
prosperity just as we do for our common security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind will make it clear that Britain, "aided by Germany,"
has played the key role in launching a high-level study of
EU-U.S. trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He will also counter the argument that trade with the Pacific
Rim has become the world's most important economic relationship by
suggesting a more liberalized transatlantic trade could contribute
to the liberalization of global trade.
</P>
<P>
He will note that with mutual investments of 500 billion U.S.
dollars and a combined total of 75 percent of all foreign
investments in the world, the EU and North America have a stake in
"widening opportunities" for enterprises around the world.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Industry Urged to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian environment experts
today urged local businessmen to observe the ISO-14000 environment
standards for acceptance of their products by other countries.
</P>
<P>
The ISO-14000, expected to be introduced in April this year,
governs environmentally-related aspects of industry, such as
environment management system and conditions, environmental
performance, evaluation, environmental labeling and life cycle
assessment.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held here, the environment experts said that the
ISO-14000 is the only effective way to ensure that the industry
0uses environmentally sound methods in production.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen are bound to face difficulties in penetrating
foreign markets unless they abide by this international ruling on
environment-related standardization, the experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have agreed to
reject any product in international trade if it does not comply
with the ISO-14000 standards, which will be fully effective in all
WTO countries by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Businesses that must be particularly careful to heed the
ISP-14000 standards are producers of textiles, garments, timber,
wood products and leather, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, earnings from the above five export commodities
have exceeded half of Indonesia's revenues from non-oil and
non-gas exports. About a quarter of these products went to Europe
and the United States, which have the strictest eco-labeling
regulations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- World Cup organisers
confirmed on Monday that matches will not be shifted out of Sri
Lanka despite Australia's decision to withdraw from their opening
match in Colombo on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Jagmohan Dalmiya, convenor-secretary of the joint
Pakistan-Indian-Lanka organising committee (PILCOM) said Sri Lanka
will continue as co-hosts and requested Australia to reconsider
their decision.
</P>
<P>
"Assurances were received from the Sri Lankan cricket board
that the government would leave no stone unturned to ensure the
strictest security and safety of the players," Dalmiya told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's request to shift the match was discussed by PILCOM
and it was felt that the situation did not warrant a change of
venues to be played in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Australia is expected to forfeit the match if it does not turn
up in Colombo on February 17, but Dalmiya said he was "confident
the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would reconsider its decision
not to play in Sri Lanka."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another PILCOM member Amrit Mathur said that it would
set a "bad precedent" if venues are changed at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
"If tomorrow there was a blast in India or Pakistan, teams will
want a change, and that's impossible now. The entire World Cup
schedule would go awry," Mathur said.
</P>
<P>
Mathur added that a walk-over will be awarded to Sri Lanka if
Australia did not go to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
"It's a strange situation. There's nothing in the World Cup
rules about forfeiting a game. It has never happened before," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Australia announced on Monday they will not play their opening
match in Sri Lanka after last week's bomb blast in Colombo which
killed 80 people and injured 1,400.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka have ruled out any change in venues, saying Australia
will have to forfeit the match. Sri Lanka also play two other
matches in Colombo -- against Zimbabwe on February 21, West
Indies on February 25. A fourth match, against Kenya, will be
held in the hill resort of Kenya on March 6.
</P>
<P>
Australia's other league matches in the month-long tournament,
scheduled to open on Sunday, will be played in India.

<P>
South Korean Chun, also the 3,000 meters world champion,
slipped with just half meter to go to pick the silver medal,
while her teammate Kun Yun-Mi, Asian champion both in 1,500 and
3,000 meters, was third at 2:29.02.
</P>
<P>
Four South Koreans reached the final. Besides Chun and Kun,
there were Won Hye-Kyung and 1,500 meters world record holder Kim
So-Hee. The other finalist was Japanese Sachi Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the standard version, in which athletes race against
the clock on 400-meter ovals, the short-track races have up to
six skaters maneuvering for position through tight turns on a
111-meter track. Race strategy can be more important than times.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean short-trackers are known for their teamwork
and experience. For less fancied Yang, to beat them was almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
Kim So-Hee quickened her pace in the second lap, in a purpose
of wearing out two non-South-Korean skaters. Then Kim Yun-Mi took
over as a leader, skating much faster.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean tactical skating ended with two laps to go
after Kim So-Hee slipped and withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
The three South Koreans, who all wanted to be champion,
scrambled in a tight turn, while Yang edged her way out of the
turn to skate shoulder-to-shoudler with Chun. Yang dipped first
while Chun lost her balance at the finish.

"Let me warn the slackers -- the indifferent, those prone to

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Hopes EAEC Membership to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today he hoped the cooperation shown in
Phuket, Thailand, by the prospective members of the East Asia
Economic Caucus (EAEC) preparing for next Month's Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM), would encourage more nations to join the EAEC.
</P>
<P>
"We will see whether the cooperation among the EAEC countries
will benefit other nations," Mahathir told reporters when arriving
at the Sultan Abdul Halim Airport in Kedah State today.
</P>
<P>
"If it brings benefits, I hope the countries that are still
reluctant to join the EAEC will decide to join it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of ten Asian countries, namely, the seven
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), and China, Japan and South Korea, met in Phuket last
Saturday to prepare for the ASEM meeting to be held in Bangkok on
March 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
On Japan, which appears still reluctant to join the EAEC,
Mahathir said that a country must consider the matter carefully,
adding that Japan also faced the pressure exerted by Europe and
the United states on all countries to open their markets to the
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know whether Japan will accept it if the United
States gets into Japan freely," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that whatever Japan's stand, that was
its problem, but Malaysia was not prepared to let developed
countries to move into Malaysia freely.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia said that if Japan cooperated with the EAEC nations,
its market might be protected from the pressure of the other
developed countries, Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Interpol Helps Indian CBI in Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Interpol is giving active
assistance to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in
exploring the foreign ramifications of the 65-crore-rupee (about
18 million US dollars) Hawala case, the newspaper Patriot reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a five-year old bribery scandal involving a
number of high ranking officials in the Indian government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has sought Interpol help for some of the following
important points:
</P>
<P>
-- To track down key Hawala operators whose names frequently
appear in the seized diaries of the Jain brothers, key Hawala
dealers implicated in the case;
</P>
<P>
-- To probe the inflow of money from abroad to India through
hawala - its quantum, the source of generation and the identities
of recipients; and
</P>
<P>
-- The contacts of some of the known Hawala operators abroad.
</P>
<P>
The report said about two years ago the CBI sent some letters
to at least two countries seeking their assistance in connection
with the Hawala case which has virtually triggered off a political
storm in India.
</P>
<P>
Hawala trade, essentially a method of money laundering, is an
illegal system of bypassing India's official foreign exchange
channel.
</P>
<P>
The CBI charged ten top Indian politicians last month for
allegedly receiving kickbacks through hawala network after
awarding lucrative power contracts to foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Business Conditions Index Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
industry appears to be moving into a phase of moderation after
achieving a rapid growth in the first part of 1995, the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research (MIER) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The institute, in its Business Conditions Survey Report for the
fourth quarter of 1995, said that the MIER Business Conditions
Index (BCI) retreated for the second consecutive quarter to 57.8
points.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a dip of 3.3 percentage points from last
quarter's 61.1. On a year-on-year basis, it shows a decline of
3.9 percentage points," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The BCI was designed to be a leading indicator of economic
activity in the country's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said that compared with the third quarter, all but
two of the economic indicators comprising the index exhibited
weaker growth pace.
</P>
<P>
Expected production, export orders, expected export sales,
current production, current sales and investment spending exerted
restraint on the overall index. Only domestic orders and capacity
utilization rates maintained their pace of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the moderating trend would filter into
the first quarter of 1996, adding that the lower index was
attributable primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the
manufacturing production in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the MIER, manufacturers in Malaysia were
predicting an upward spiral in wage cost in the first three months
of 1996, in view of the upcoming salary adjustment, release of
bonus payments and higher levy on foreign workers under the 1996
budget.

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Party Reveals Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- India's major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Sunday revealed its election
manifesto envisaging a political trident on the issues of
security, self reliance and public probity, the Hindustan Times
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party rally here, BJP President L.K. Advani, who
resigned his House of the People seat over the Hawala scandal,
said the main thrust of the BJP in the coming general elections
would be on corruption and national security.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala case is a five-year-old bribery scandal in which
foreign exchange dealers S.K. Jain and others paid a total of 20
million US dollars to a number of high-ranking officials in the
government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
As to his involvement in the Hawala case, Advani said that he
would renounce political life if found guilty by a court in the
case.
</P>
<P>
"I will not enter parliament unless the prosecution is fully
convinced that I had nothing to do with the alleged Jain brothers
pay-off case," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the general election of 1996 was very
important because it would be the last one of this century.
</P>
<P>
At the same rally, senior BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee
appealed to all political parties including the ruling Congress
Party to discuss measures to check the use of black money and
donations from industrial houses for election expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Attracts More Tourists, Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 385,000 foreigners from
about 190 countries and regions of the world visited Lebanon
during the first 11 months of 1995, a figure 23 percent more than
that in the whole 1994, according to Lebanese official statistics
available today.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the number of foreign visitors to Lebanon is due to
the marked improvement in the security situation there after the
1975-1990 civil war, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lebanese Tourism Ministry statistics, these
visitors did not include the 1,940,000 Syrian tourists and
businessmen who toured Lebanon during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon borders Syria and the two countries have very close
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics show that Arab tourists, coming from 20 Arab
countries excluding Syria, numbered 143,226, accounting for 37.2
percent of the total foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, about 1 million foreign visitors, excluding those from
Syria, toured Lebanon, and tourism was one of the country's main
foreign exchange earners, amounting to 20 percent of the state
revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan-invested firms developed
rapidly in both number and scale in east China's Jiangsu Province
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of that year 6,100 Taiwan-invested firms had been
approved by the provincial government, 1,100 more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has established close relationships of co-operation
with medium-sized and small Taiwan-invested firms in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial government said that township
enterprises around Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou cities have drawn
the largest number of Taiwan investors, thanks to their advanced
technology and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwan-invested firms has reached 1,800 in
Suzhou, accounting for one third of the total in the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Jiangsu registered 100 projects with an average
investment of over ten million US dollars. And over 20 out of the
100 leading companies in Taiwan had invested in Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Actual foreign capital in Jiangsu increased markedly in 1995 as
a result of the favorable investment environment.
</P>
<P>
So far, 52 percent of the 8.5 billion US dollars in contractual
funds have materialized, with investment in 70 percent of the big
projects already in place.

</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the region produced an average annual
amount of two million tons of sugar in the 1991-1995 period,
accounting for one third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Located in the country's subtropical area, Guangxi is ideal for

<P>
While setting up 18 sugarcane production bases, the region has
invested 2.2 billion yuan in upgrading or building 170 sugar
refineries over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The development of the sugar industry has helped boost the
local foodstuffs, medicine, papermaking, chemical fertilizer,
machinery and transportation industries. Many farmers have become
well-off by planting sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
At present, the region is working out measures to boost the
annual sugar output to three million tons by the year 2000.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Police Commander
Nasser Yusef and Israeli Rabbi Itzhak Bardea received Rothfield
Peace Prize awarded by the Tel Aviv-based International Center for
Peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The award was presented Sunday night by Israeli Environment
Minister Yossi Sarid at a ceremony held at Tel Aviv's Carlton
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the ceremony was former Hamas leader
Imad Falouji, who was elected to the Palestinian Council
recently.
</P>
<P>
Falouji said he believes that a full peace between Israel and
the Palestinians can be achieved long before the establishment of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Bardea, Chief Sephardi Rabbi of Ramat Gan, is the
founder of the Harish group, comprised of Israeli rabbis who
support the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He has spent much of his time working against discrimination
and religious intolerance as well as for peace.
</P>
<P>
General Yusef arrived in Gaza in 1994 following his
appointment by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Yusef, 52, is one of
the founders of the Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival in Gaza, Yusef has made it a point to bring
the Israeli and Palestinian peoples together. "All my life have
been a solider," he said, "and now it is time for peace."
</P>
<P>
He claims that peace cannot be made behind barbed wire, and he
hopes to create social stability in Gaza as well as economic
projects that bring Israelis and Palestinians together.
</P>
<P>
In this spirit, he has initiated meetings between academics,
economists and business people, and works to spread support for
peace among Palestinian citizens. He has also been quoted widely
in support of dialogue with Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Proposal on Direct Mail Exchange Across Taiwan Straits Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications Wu Jichuan today announced a five-point
proposal on the direct exchange of mail and telecommunications
services across the Taiwan Straits at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the proposal at a forum to mark the first anniversary
of the speech of President Jiang Zemin on promoting China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Here is the gist of his proposal:
</P>
<P>
-- Opening a direct mail route between the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan via shipping and air services to achieve the direct
exchange of mail services;
</P>
<P>
-- Creating conditions for the laying of a direct
cross-straits submarine optical fiber cable line, and opening a
direct cross-straits telecommunications route via optical fiber
cable and satellites to realize the direct exchange of
telecommunications services;
</P>
<P>
-- Further increasing the exchange of cross-straits posts and
telecommunications services, as well as the variety of such
services provided between both sides of the straits, and
unclogging the information exchange across the straits;
</P>
<P>
-- Expanding the cross-straits exchanges and co-operation in
such areas as economy, technology, culture and education among
posts and telecommunications businesses; and
</P>
<P>
-- Holding consultations through various channels on matters
relating to the direct exchange of mail and telecommunications
services, in accordance with the "one China" principle. The
specific time, place and methods for such consultations are open
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Minister Wu said that, owing to the obstacles put up by the
Taiwan authorities, cross-straits mail and telecommunications
services are now being exchanged indirectly, via Hong Kong or
other places.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Taiwan authorities for taking the direct
cross-straits exchange of mail services, shipping and air services
and trade as "political chips" and using hindrance of direct
exchange of mail and telecommunications services to serve their
political end of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"This practice is in total disregard of the interests of the
people across the Taiwan Straits and highly unpopular," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He described the historical process of China's peaceful
reunification as "irresistible", saying that the realization of
the direct cross-straits exchange of mail and telecommunications
services is an "inevitable trend".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities would set
store by the common interests of the Chinese nation, including the
Taiwan compatriots, and the great cause of China's peaceful
reunification, and eliminate all obstacles to the direct
cross-straits exchange of mail and telecommunications, so as to
realize the common aspiration of the people on both sides of the
straits at an early date.
</P>
<P>
At the forum other senior officials of the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications expressed support for the five-point
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Minghuan, director-general of posts, urged the Taiwan
authorities to decontrol such cross-straits postal services as
parcels and express mail.
</P>
<P>
He said that his administration is ready to carry out
technological co-operation with its Taiwan counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ligui, director-general of telecommunications, said that
the administration of telecommunications is ready to discuss with
its Taiwan counterpart specific measures to use existing
satellites, submarine cables and other telecommunications means.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Privatize Rubber Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is planning to
privatize rubber plantations in Kompong Cham Province in the
southeastern part of the country, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fishery has said.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "the Cambodia today" quoted the minister,
Tao Seng Hour, as saying recently that he had already submitted
the privatization proposals to the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Three state-owned plantations of a total of 31,000 hectares
will be among the first to be privatized, Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that privatization of most state-owned rubber
plantations is necessary, as almost all of the trees there are old
and do not produce much latex, and some of them none at all.
</P>
<P>
With the privatization process underway, companies can start
felling the old trees in stages, and replace them with high-yield
ones, Tao added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> B Shares Issue To Go National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China will allow more cities
and regions to issue B shares this year as an important step to
revitalize the lackluster B share market.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission Zhou
Daojing said that the securities authorities will select a group
of enterprises on a nationwide basis to issue B shares in 1996 to
promote the expansion of B share market.
</P>
<P>
These would-be B share issuers are primarily large efficient
firms in basic industries such as energy, transportation,
telecommunications and key raw materials, Zhou told a seminar on
the development of the B share market which was convened in
southwest China's Kunming City, noting that firms engaging in new
and hi-tech industries are also favorite prospective issuers.
</P>
<P>
B shares, denominated in yuan but traded in US dollars, are
designed for overseas investors. So far, the issuers have been
limited to firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and number 70 at
present.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 China had issued 6.43 billion yuan-worth of
B shares, raising a total of 3.01 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, trading in B shares has been sluggish, with the B
share indices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses lingering
around 52 points and 555 points.
</P>
<P>
Zhou blamed the restraint in issuance location as a major
obstacle to the market's developing toward a standardized and
efficient one of considerable scale.
</P>
<P>
He also said that problems in information disclosure, and the
managerial and accounting systems of B share issuers have dampened
the enthusiasm of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
While expanding B share issuance, China should strengthen
supervision so that the market can grow to maturity in a steady
and assured way.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Governors Pay Attention to Educational Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's regional leaders have
promised to do more for educational development in their provinces.
</P>
<P>
State Education Commission (SEC) sources said here today
that the leaders of China's 30 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have written articles to discuss the importance
of giving priority to the development of education.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province, said
that his province will continue making efforts to ensure that at
least 20 percent of its financial expenditure should be on
education.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Silin, governor of east China's Jiangsu Province, said
that Jiangsu is trying to improve schooling conditions and
teachers' treatment while implementing the Education Law.
</P>
<P>
Zheng signed letters of responsibility with four mayors from
the northern part of the province where teachers can not get their
salaries on time. The letters promise to give no more IOUs to
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hunan Province checks educational expenses
every year. Wang Maolin, secretary of the provincial committee of
the Communist Party of China, said that it will make public the
results and investigate the responsibility of leaders if any
malpractice is discovered.
</P>
<P>
The SEC sources said that southwest China's Yunnan Province and
east China's Jiangxi Province have paid all the teachers who were
not paid last year, though the provinces are not economically
advanced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other provinces such as north China's Hebei,
northeast China's Jilin and northwest Shaanxi are ready to fully
implement the Education Law.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people made a
beeline to the State Bank here today to buy the newly-issued
two-Ringgit bank notes.
</P>
<P>
Although the counters only opened at 9:30 a.m., many had

The newly-issued two-Ringgit bank notes are the smallest paper

limited quantities. The commemorative notes are available at 20
Ringgit (about 8 US dollars) for a set of three-in-one and 250
Ringgit (about 100 dollars) for a set of 30-in-one.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a large crowd, the state bank deployed additional

<P>
A bank spokesman said the commemorative bills were limited to
2,000 Ringgit (about 800 dollars) per person and will be sold
while stocks last.
</P>
<P>
Measuring 130mm by 65mm, the two-Ringgit bill is in a light
shade of purple. Apart from the portrait of Malaysia's first Yang
di-Pertuan Agong (king) on the front side, the new note also
carries on its back the motif of the Kuala Lumpur TV Tower, and a
satellite in orbit with the map of the Southeast Asia in the
background.

<P>
To meet the demand, the China Central Television Station has

<HEADLINE> Reutero Suarez Apologizes to Xie, Polgar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 5 (Xinhua) -- World women's chess
championship's technical committee presented apologies to
reigning champion Xie Jun of China and challenger Zsuzsa Polgar
of Hungary here on Sunday for its complaints about the two
players' quick draws at two games.
</P>
<P>
In writing to the two players, Luis Reutero Suarez, chief of
the technical committee, expressed his regret over what he
described as their "misunderstanding of his remarks."
</P>
<P>
Suarez issued an ultimatum last Friday to Xie and Polgar to
either play the games or back to their countries, complaining
that both players seemed as if they were "touring Jaen" instead
of "playing games."
</P>
<P>
Both Xie and Polgar were fined 25,000 U.S. dollars because
they drew the second and third games after 17 and 19 moves
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Suarez offered "sincere apology" to Xie and
asked for "pardon" from Polgar.
</P>
<P>
Suarez also said that he took back what he had said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Suarez admitted that his decision
was "unreasonable and hasty" and was not in line with the laws of
the International Chess Federation.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the friendship between the Chinese people and
the Spanish people. I hope Chinese delegation will have a good
stay in Jaen," said Suarez in another letter to the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He believed that nothing will happen again to make the two
sides unhappy during the championships.
</P>
<P>
But Suarez insisted that the second and third games lacked
"competitiveness" and urged the two players to "do their best" in
the 12 games to play.

<HEADLINE> Prokacheva Starts Kazakhstan's Debut in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 5 (Xinnhua) -- World championships
women's runner-up Lioudmila Prokacheva kicked off Kazakhstan's
debut at the Winter Asian Games by winning the games' first gold
medal with a new Asian record at the 3,000 meters speedskating.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva, 27, clocked four minutes 25.98 seconds to break the
Asian record of 4:32.95 set by Japanese Hashimoto Seiko in the
1992 Asian Cup in Chichibu of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Eriko Seo of Japan, a 16-year-old high school student, won the
silver medal with a time of 4:28.84, while her teammate Saori
Igami finished third at 4:34.29.
</P>
<P>
The top six finishers in the field of 12 all surpassed the
games record of 4:39.35.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva, fourth-place finisher at the 3,000 meters in the
Olympic Games in Lillehammer of Norway, said she skated well
throughout the race.
</P>
<P>
Prokacheva, whose personal best is 4:18.00, said she had known
that the first title would go to her and she didn't feel
pressured.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, strong at the figure skating, speedskating and the
cross country skiing and biathlon, will very likely edge its way
in to the top three which had been Japan, China and South Korea in
the previous two games both held in Sapporo of Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 5,000 meters speedskating, Japanese Mitsuru
Watanabe and Daigo Miyaki finished one-two while Kazakhstan's
Evgueni Sanarov placed third.
</P>
<P>
Watanabe skated home with a time of seven minutes 03.99
seconds, beating his teammate by 01.84 seconds and Sanarov by a
further 0.38 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers all bettered the Asian record of 7:10.58
set by Kazuhiro Sato of Japan in the First Asian Cup held in
Beijing in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Watanabe, who skated his personal best on
Monday, said that he was not surprised to take the gold medal
and the Asian record.

<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Different professional groups in
Bangladesh have expressed support to the opposition move to resist
the "one party" elections to be conducted by the ruling party on
February 15, according to sources concerned.
</P>
<P>
The groups expressed their solidarity with the opposition
Sunday at a meeting with Shiekh Hasina, president of the largest
opposition party -- the Awami (people's) League, vowing to resist
the "mock vote" under the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Election Commission has fixed February 15 as the
polling date after several times of schedule shift. Although the
opposition has boycotted the election process, the BNP and its
government has decided to go ahead with the polls with some
smaller political parties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the opposition chief and trade union
leaders, lawyers, writers, poets, dramatists and intellectuals
gave a joint call to build a united resistance against the
"farcical" polls and to realize the demand for elections under a
neutral caretaker government, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the meeting also demanded immediate halt to the
"one-party" election, resignation of the prime minister and fresh
schedule of election under a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the seven-party alliance and the
Bangladesh Janata Party Sunday urged people to take part in the
elections to uphold the continuity of the constitutional and
democratic process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The infant democracy would be suppressed if the ensuing
parliamentary election is not held on February 21, the leaders
said in a meeting, adding that the people are not ready to accept
any constitutional vacuums.

<HEADLINE> Exact Birthplace of Buddha Found in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent archaeological
discovery in west Nepal has strongly supported the country's claim
over the birthplace of lord Buddha, or Sakyamuni, founder of
Buddhism, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The exact location of Buddha's birthplace has been found in the
inner room of an ancient temple during an excavation last year in
Lumbini of western Nepal, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
announced here Sunday at an official ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made nine months ago by Nepali and Japanese
archaeologists during the excavation in the rectangular bricked
structure just in front of the idol of Mayadevi, or mother
goddess.
</P>
<P>
The sacred site was located five meters under ground,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have reached the conclusion that during his
visit to Lumbini in around 250 B.C., Emperor Ashoka placed a stone
pillar there to show the exact birthplace of Sakyamuni, where the
Mayadevi temple was built later.
</P>
<P>
The new finding was formally declared Sunday after
archaeologists from Nepal, Japan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka agreed that lord Buddha was born at the very spot where
the Ashoka stone was placed.
</P>
<P>
A Nepali archaeologist participating in the excavation
activities said the broken stone pieces unearthed under the
Mayadevi statue was a conclusive proof of lord Buddha's nativity.
</P>
<P>
Although west Nepal's Lumbini was generally recognized as the
birthplace of lord Buddha and has become the Mecca of Buddhists
all over the world, Indian researchers have long tried to include
the holy site of Buddhism in their national territory.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the discovery Sunday, Nepali Prime Minister Deuba
expressed his confidence that the sacred place of Buddhism, which
has survived through historical ages, would continue to attract
pilgrims and tourists from other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists involved in the excavation said they were
compelled to cut down the famous pipal tree in the Mayadevi temple
as the excavation work was impossible without the removal of the
tree.

<HEADLINE> Job Ads Gives Hope To Australian Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian job market saw
some light today after remaining in the doldrums for almost a
year.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ bank job advertisement series, an employment indicator
based on job advertisements in newspapers in all major Australian
cities, rose 5.7 percent seasonally adjusted in January, the
biggest monthly increase since July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, the series rose by 0.2 percent in January after
a 0.1 percent rise in December last year, the ANZ bank announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that after declining for the past 11 months
since last February, the ANZ job advertisement series might have
bottomed and begun to rally, ANZ bank economists said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Employment Minister Simon Crean welcomed the figures as
a "clear evidence of a strengthening labor market and for more job
growth."
</P>
<P>
"This is proof that the Labor government has the right economic
settings in place," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Employment data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) last month also showed that the unemployment rate registered
a record monthly drop of half a percentage point to 8.1 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
But bank economists cautioned that the ANZ job advertisement
series were historically volatile in January and February. They
said that further employment figures for March and April were
needed to confirm the rally of the job market.
</P>
<P>
The January job advertisement series was still 6.1 percent
lower than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Local forecasters expect employment to fall by 10,000 and the
unemployment rate to rise to over 8.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The ABS employment figures will be released on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Increases Tax Collection Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has readjusted its
tax collection target of the current fiscal year from 265 billion
rupees (7.72 billion US dollars) to 276 billion rupees (8.04
billion dollars), local paper The News reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) so
far has not announced the adjusted target for fear of an
unforeseen slump in the revenue later in the fiscal year from July
1995 to June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government originally set the tax collection
target at 270 billion rupees (7.86 billion dollars) for the fiscal
year of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Due to downward trend of revenue in the first quarter of the
fiscal year, from July to September last year, the CBR revised the
target to 265 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
In October, the government imposed a 10-percent regulatory duty
and devalued Pakistani rupee by seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Since then, tax collection has taken a turn for the better and
the CBR revised upward the target by 11 billion rupees (320
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the step was unprecedented over the past couple
of decades.

take immediate measures to ensure the security of schools in the
city of Colombo in face of possible rebel attacks, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry have had several rounds of discussions
with the Defense Ministry and police on this matter, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The principals of some leading schools in Colombo have
requested that several roads in the city be closed during school
hours.

Meanwhile, school authorities have been advised to obtain the
support of parents' organizations to maintain special vigilance
and take all possible precautions regarding the security of
schools facing a potential threat.
</P>
<P>
According to school sources, there had been a noticeable drop
in attendance in schools following last Wednesday's bomb blast at
the Central Bank in the business center of Colombo which had left
more than 80 persons dead and over 1,400 injured.

ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A two-day-old
unrest in Conakry, Guinea, quieted down as rebellious troops
returned to their barracks and the airport in the capital was
reopened.
</P>
<P>
The rebellious situation, in which some 30 people were killed
and more than 100 others injured, got under control when Guinean
President Lansana Conte reached a compromise with the rebels late
on Saturday, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Conte announced at his Amory Camp in central Conakry that he
himself is replacing Defense Minister Abdourahamane Diallo, who
was dismissed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the president as saying he would consider all
the demands put forward by the rebellious troops.
</P>
<P>
Early on Friday, some 2,000 troops mutinied by launching
attacks on the troops remaining loyal to the Guinean
president. They also seized the Conakry airport, interrupted
traffic inside the capital city and bombarded the presidential
palace while demanding a pay raise and dismissal of the defense
minister.

<HEADLINE> NATO Enlargement to Continue Despite Russia's Objection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Minister William
Perry reiterated today that NATO enlargement is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the NATO's eastward expansion will be helpful
to security and stability in Europe and that Russia should not
regard the expansion as a threat.
</P>
<P>
Perry's comments, made at the two-day International Security
Conference in Munich, Germany, came a day after Russian Deputy
Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin warned that the NATO expansion
could spark a backlash against reforms in his country as Moscow
suspects the intentions of such enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the United States will approve a series of treaties
this year to further strengthen the current "peace partnership"
between the NATO and Russia. He suggested the partnership be
expanded to cover the science, environmental protection, health
and agricultural sectors in a bid to enhance Russia's confidence
in the NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian troops' participation in the NATO-led
Implementation Force, which is helping safeguard the peace accord
in Bosnia, will play a positive role in strengthening the
cooperation between Moscow and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
He announced that U.S. and Russian troops will hold a joint
military exercise in the coming summer, to be participated by
Ukraine and other east European countries.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also stressed the
importance of the NATO enlargement and called for preparatory work
for the expansion. However, he said the enlargement should not end
up in isolating Russia, adding, "Isolating Russia would be a
historic error."
</P>
<P>
The international security conference, which ended today,
attracted 170 military and defense experts.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Becomes Most Attractive City in China's Hinterland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- This capital city in central
China's Hubei Province approved 668 foreign-funded projects in
1995, involving a contractual value of 900 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of foreign funds used last year soared to
1.2 billion U.S. dollars, ranking first among inland cities in the
country for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the focus of foreign investment is shifting
gradually from China's eastern coast to central and western parts,
said Yang Dezhen, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Office in
charge of Foreign Investment.
</P>
<P>
Development of Shanghai-based Pudong New Area and the Three
Gorges Project in the Yangtze River, the largest hydro-electric
project in China, also contributed to an upsurge of foreign
investment in Wuhan, which is on the middle reaches of the river,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city received 170 groups of foreign businessmen,
70 percent of whom came from Europe and the United States and 80
percent were sent by governments or transnational companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors have eyed the transformation of large- and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Influx of overseas investment has boosted economic growth of
this provincial capital city, especially its five pillar
industries: foodstuff processing, garment, iron and steel and
automobile production and telecommunications.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh
prosecution has charged President of the Supreme Court Mikhail
Malakhov with bribery while the state security commission is to
investigate into the case, the Kazakh state television reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The television report quoted Procurator-General Maksut
Narikbaev as saying a lawsuit had already been filed against
Malakhov after Umegen Ikhsamov, a judge of the supreme court,
charged the president with taking bribes of more than 100,000
U.S. dollars in cash and three sedan cars.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court judge said he has enough evidence to prove
Malakhov's wrongdoing whereas Malakhov denied the charge by
describing it as a libel.
</P>
<P>
The state television interviewed Nagashbai Shaikenov, deputy
prime minister in charge of law and justice, and Zharmakhan
Tuyakbayev, chairman of the state investigation committee. But
both declined to comment on the case which, once established,
would become the largest political scandal in the country in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Meteorologist Explains Lower Precipitation in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The change of the general
circulation of the atmosphere is mainly to blame for the lower
precipitation in the northern part of China this winter, said Chen
Xingfang, a meteorologist with the National Climate Center.
</P>
<P>
There has been scarcely any rain or snow in northern China
since this year's winter season began. The precipitation, in
general, has seen a 50-70 percent decrease over ordinary
years. Some regions such as Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning
provinces have even seen a decrease of more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is partly attributed to the change in the location of low
pressure around the North Pole, which has shifted to the central
part of the Eurasian continent, drifting well to the west. The
change has weakened the cold front coming into the northwestern
part of China, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Previous data has shown that such a phenomenon usually happens
in connection with a big rise of the sea water temperature around
the Equator in the eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It is quite common for north China to witness lower
precipitation during the winter season. So the precipitation
scarcity this year is not rare, but is a little bit more obvious
than in previous years, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Caught in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 4 (Xinhua) -- In the latest crackdown on
illegal immigration to the country, the Romanian border police
rounded up 33 Bangladeshies who attempted to sneak into the
central European country today.
</P>
<P>
They were caught when trying to cross Galati on the eastern
border of Romania, the Romania Television-Bucharest TV Central
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Over the most recent years, Romania has served as a springboard
to western Europe rather than the permanent homes to illegal
immigrants, whose number has reportedly soared to 20,000. Many of
them came from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
These people, with little education and few skills, usually
turn to crime for supporting themselves during their sojourn in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1995, 3,600 out of the total 22,000
criminal cases in Romania were committed by foreigners, who were
chargeed with illegal carrying of weapons, money forging and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government has imposed strict restrictions on
entry into the country. The Interior Ministry set up a special
bureau on July 1, 1995, to tighten controls over foreign residents
in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province is
working hard to attract nine billion US dollars in foreign
investment in the coming five years for the construction of
infrastructure, and the upgrading of state-owned enterprises and
backbone industries, said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhuping, governor of the province, told a conference on
using foreign investment that of the total foreign investment, 2.5
billion US dollars will be in foreign loans and 6.5 billion US
dollars will be in direct foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was optimistic about meeting the goals as Hubei
is located in a strategic position joining east China with other
interior provinces, and its capital, Wuhan, has been designated by
the State Council as an open city along with another two cities in
the province, namely Huangshi and Yichang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province is home to a major iron and steel
giant, an automobile production base and the gigantic Three Gorges
Project, which can provide foreign investors with vast investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the province turned out over 200
billion yuan in industrial output value in 1995, up nearly 20
percent over the previous year. In the past ten years or so it
has used nearly 1.3 billion US dollars in foreign loans for the
construction of more than 90 projects in such sectors as energy,
communications and raw materials production.

<P>
HOHHOT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to develop and use
the last two stretches of primeval forests in the Dahinggan
Mountains in its northeast part in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Located in the east Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the
forests cover four million hectares accounting for 35 percent of
the total Dahinggan Mountains.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the two stretches have about 250 million
cubic meters of timber reserves. Some 700,000 cubic meters of wood
have been naturally lost annually as a result of being struck by
lightning, or eaten by insects.
</P>
<P>
According to plan, the Dahinggan Mountains Forestry
Administration is building roads to crisscross the forests, which
are expected turn out 870,000 cubic meters of market-oriented
timber a year.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Russia Close Round-Table Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Polish and Russian policy makers
exchanged views on bilateral relations and matters concerning both
countries at a round-table which closed here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Though divergence of views still exists, the two-day meeting
served as the beginning of a resumption of political dialogue
aimed at reestablishing mutual understanding and trust between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants from the presidential advisory office, national
security council, strategy institute and academy of sciences of
the two countries had free and straightforward discussions on the
most important and most sensitive issues concerning the
Polish-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that more round-tables, to be held at regular
intervals in the future, will enhance mutual understanding and
iron out differences in opinions.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati told the meeting that
Polish-Russian relationship is of special importance to his
country which gives priority to maintaining rapprochement with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Poland and Russia posted a record increase last
year and the conferees expressed satisfaction over the fast
developing economic cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Poles and Russians, however, are still poles apart as
regards the issue of the eastward enlargement by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Poland has planned and prepared to join the North Atlantic
Alliance and listed it high on its political agenda ever since
1989.
</P>
<P>
Russia however is strongly opposed to the NATO expansion. It
reiterated at the round-table that the planned expansion will pose
a direct military threat to the country and that it is possible
the Commonwealth of Independent States will form a military
alliance should the NATO expansion turn out to be an obstacle to
peace in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Government Trails Opposition in 2nd Week Of Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor
government still lagged far behind the Opposition in public
opinion polls in the second week into the federal election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The latest AGB McNair poll showed that half of Australian
voters support the Opposition coalition led by the Liberal party,
while only 39 percent support the incumbent Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Asked to make a choice between the two parties, 55 percent of
voters prefer the Opposition to the Labor, compared with 43
percent who endorse the Labor over the Opposition.
</P>
<P>
Though the Labor government has been catching up with the
Opposition slowly since the election campaign began on January 28,
it saw a dramatic swing of voters' confidence in the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll carried out last weekend showed that 45 percent of
voters expect the Opposition to win, no matter which party they
will vote for. Only 38 percent think the Labor will win.
</P>
<P>
This is almost a total reversal of the situation a week ago,
when 44 percent of voters believed that the Labor Government would
be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
In Victoria state, where the Labor expects to win extra seats
to offset possible losses in Queensland and New South Wales, the
Labor fell behind the Opposition from its original leading
position. It has clawed back to near the Opposition in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
In the first week of the election campaign, the Labor has been
aggressive in attacking the Opposition's policies. But its
assaults have not caught adequate public attention, because the
Opposition kept playing hide-and-seek with the Labor by not
releasing detailed policies.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of voters surveyed said that they had made up
their minds on whom they would vote for. This is a bad news for
the Labor, which relies on the swing of undecided voters to catch
up with and beat the Opposition in the election.

<HEADLINE> Former Farmer Aids Student Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- When Liu Lizhi, a high school
graduate in Qinshui County in east China's Shandong province,
received 3,000 yuan from a woman farmer, he was overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
This year, Liu received the admission notice from the People's
University, one of the top universities in China, However, his
family would not be able to afford the 2,000 yuan yearly expense
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu's mother died when he was nine and his father was paralyzed
when he was 13. He has a grandfather and a younger sister.
</P>
<P>
Liu has been forced to drop out several times and was only able
to finish secondary school education with the help of his teachers
and classmates.
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Liu's story reached the ears of Guo Fenglan, a
successful woman entrepreneur, who immediately donated 3,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Almost illiterate herself, Guo knew how precious knowledge
is. She used to be a common farmer. In 1987 she set up a factory
making cotton shoes and the business was quite successful. She
still spends every cent like two. However when it came to
charities, she was always open-handed.
</P>
<P>
Guo said "I gave Liu a hand because I see he will have a bright
future, and I hope he will study hard to contribute more to the
country."

<HEADLINE> Soaring Price of Paper to be Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Paper price are not expected to
surge up this year, due to adequate supplies in both domestic and
international markets and the macro price control implemented by
the central government.
</P>
<P>
But the trend towards higher prices which started early last
year will continue for a period of time, today's China's Daily
quoted an official from the China Council of Light Industry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the burgeoning supply to the growing production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Stimulated by soaring prices, pulp and paper manufacturers
across the world are expanding their output, according to a report
released by the International Paper and Packaging Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of paper and paper boards in Indonesia will
reach 3.15 million tons by 1997 after it brings into operation two
production lines with combined output of 550 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will turn to China's paper industry, setting up joint
ventures or expanding production capacities of the existing paper
mills in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more waste-paper recycling and the application of
technology to producing paper with no-wood pulps is easing the
shortage of raw materials, the main cause of price increase.
</P>
<P>
Another factor curbing the surging price trend is a drop in
demand, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said higher prices had dampened the overheated demand for
newsprint, paper for cultural purposes and paper boards.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1995, the price of paper has gone up by between 18
and 58 percent across the world.
</P>
<P>
The price of domestically made newsprint, for example, rose to
5,600 yuan (675 US dollars) per ton in July -- over 7,000 yuan(843
dollars) in some places -- up from an average of 4,300 yuan(510)
per ton in 1994.

<HEADLINE> China to Crack Down on Publication Code Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China will further ban
publishing houses from selling publication codes, state licences
for authorized works, to underground compact disc (CD) businesses,
an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xunning, in charge of audio and video affairs of the
Press and Publications Administration, said that illegal income
obtained from such transactions will be confiscated and the
publishing houses will be fined or even closed.
</P>
<P>
State publishing houses will monopolize the distribution of
imported video and audio products, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"The measure is expected to eliminate the rampant infringement
on CD copyrights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese publishing houses can obtain the right to compile and
publish CD works only after they are given approval by the
government. The works are then given publication codes as a sign
of authorization.
</P>
<P>
That is why some underground publishers have been trying to
obtain codes, Zhang said, adding that this is one factor
triggering copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
And some state publishing houses sell codes to illegal
publishers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts, which have disrupted the publication business and
international copyright norms, is resolutely opposed by the
Chinese government," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Art Exhibition in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China will hold the '96 Art
Exposition in August, which is the only channel for overseas art
works to enter the Chinese art market and the best occasion for
foreign art dealers to seek business co-operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the Ministry of Culture sponsors the
exposition, which is scheduled to open in Beijing's China
International Exhibition Centre on August 16 and run through
August 20, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The art market in China has developed rapidly with the
establishment of a market-oriented economic infrastructure since
the beginning of the 1990s. Chinese enterprises, art dealers and
art collectors are casting their eyes on various kinds of
outstanding art works.
</P>
<P>
The previous three China art expositions, which were the most
extensive art exhibitions and the only art fairs in the country,
have caught the attention of Chinese leaders and broad masses and
have become a special cultural aspect of Chinese society,
according to Fan Dian, art director of the exposition.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote international exchanges and expand art
trade, preferential treatment and good services have been offered
to participants in the expositions. This year, the Chinese
government has made important rearrangements on import duties. The
tax rates for art works have declined significantly as compared
with that in the past, according to the organizers. This offers
foreign galleries, art institutions and art dealers a good
opportunity for their trade activities in China.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government, Rebels Reach Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov today tried to defuse a current rebel crisis by
dismissing his first Deputy Prime Minister Makhmadsayid
Ubaidullayev and offering amnesty to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He also fired Chief of Presidential Staff Izatullo Khaeveva and
several other government officials in an effort to quench an armed
conflict between the government and ethnic rebels in Kurgan-Tyube
and Tursunzade in southern and western Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, including the First Tajik Mechanized Brigade and
the former mayor of Tursunzade, as a result, have agreed to scrap
their demand to force Tajik Defense Minister Sherali Khairullayev
to step down and move back to their original barracks, according
to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
Unrest flared up on January 26 after the Central Asian state's
highest Muslim cleric, Mufti Sharipov, and his family were
murdered.
</P>
<P>
Interfax also reported that the government troops and rebels
stopped fighting in Tavildarinski today due to bad weather in
central Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
But the Tajik Defense Ministry announced that it will reinforce
its troops in Tavildarinski to guarantee the security of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan, a mountainous state of 5.7 million people bordering
Afghanistan, has been plagued by unrest since 1992 after a bloody
civil war in which Islamic forces were driven out of the country.

<HEADLINE> 370 Million Promised For Australian National Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating promised today that the Labor Government would spend 370
million Australian dollars (277.5 million US dollars) to upgrade
the country's coast-to-coast rail link if it is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Keating said on a radio station in South Australia state that
the Labor Government will develop "Track Australia," a single
management body that owns the railway line from Brisbane in the
east to Perth in the west.
</P>
<P>
He likened Track Australia to a public owned highway for
privately owned cars. He said that the ownership of the railway
will be separated from train operators and the Government would
encourage freight companies to swap their trucks for trains.
</P>
<P>
"So it will be very much publicly owned," he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the Federal Government would spend 37 million
Australian dollars over five years to improve the quality of the
railway, which has been "left to rot by the states."
</P>
<P>
"In some places the trains can only do 10 or 15 kilometers per
hour," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the states have adopted a uniform gauge of railways
across their borders. It was the first time in Australia's history
that a train could travel unstopped from the east coast to the
west coast.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that it was time to invest in the track quality
and "take Australia's railway system out of the 19th century."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government would upgrade the railway link into
a "publicly owned, high quality, properly invested rail track"
centered on South Australia state.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Government proposed a single management of the
national railway system when the uniform gauge was adopted on the
inter-state railway last year.

<HEADLINE> Rare Gingko Trees Discovered in Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nine gingko trees have
branched out from the trunk of a 1,200-year-old parent tree
in Anfu County in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers have mistaken the young trees as one for more
than a decade since they began to grow from the stump of an old
gingko tree which was broken by a storm in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Looking like an enormous umbrella, the nine trees shade a total
area of 250 sq m. The largest one is 90 cm in diameter and 21 m
tall.
</P>
<P>
Villagers are not sure whether the trees have something to do
with a well nearby, which is believed to be as old as the parent
gingko tree. They now still fetch water from the well.
</P>
<P>
Gingko is a valuable species under the first-class state
protection in China. A 3,000 year-old gingko is still prospering
in Jinan, the capital of east China's Shandong Province.

<P>
YINCHUAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in northwest China witnessed a bumper harvest last year,
despite frequent natural disasters which hit 550,000 ha of farmland
</P>
<P>
The grain output of the region reached 2.011 million tons, the
second-highest grain harvest in the region's history, according to
the local statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the production of pork, eggs and milk jumped by 17.8
percent, 21.4 percent and 40.7 percent to reach 103,000 tons,
32,600 tons and 119,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bumper harvest brought about a remarkable increase in
farmers' average per capita income, which climbed by 140 yuan to
reach 1,050 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the achievements mainly to the
efforts by both local governments and farmers to step up
agricultural production and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The region has managed to protect and expand its grain
acreage. Figures show that the area has increased by 12,000 ha
over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the construction of water-control facilities
in the region has received a major boost in recent years, with
more than 80 million yuan injected into such projects in the first
half of last year alone.

<HEADLINE> Asian Migrant Women Workers on Rise, Needing Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Labour
Organization (ILO) Monday reported a rapid growth of Asia migrant
women workers since mid-1970s and called for efforts to guarantee
the basic human rights of the unprotected and vulnerable group.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.5 million Asian women, both legal and illegal,
are working abroad, ILO said in a report. The countries of origin
report an aggregate outflow of 800,000 female migrant workers
annually as well as a continued steady increase in the number.
</P>
<P>
Asian women make up the fastest-growing category of the world's
burgeoning 35-million plus population of migrant workers, it is
added.
</P>
<P>
Study shows that by 1976, still in the beginning of the Asian
labour migration, women comprised about 15 percent of the 146,400
Asian workers overseas, and by 1987, some 27 percent of the
million or so Asians leaving that year to work abroad. Today, the
total number of them often equals or surpasses that of male
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand are the main
sending countries of women labour, while the main receiving
countries are the Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the wide wage gap between sending and
receiving countries, the increasing economic burden of women as a
result of rising male unemployment as well as the existence of
large social networks that facilitate migration are among the
factors leading to the situation today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ILO in the report highlighted the plight of
unprotected female migrant workers, calling for national and
international efforts to guarantee the basic human rights of the
group, which it described as "vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
"While migration provides productive labour and an economic
lifeline for millions of Asian women, the dramatic plight of
unprotected female migrant workers has become an increasing source
of public concern as evidence of abuses mounts", it said.
</P>
<P>
As it is reported, Asian women labour concentrate in a very
limited number of female-dominated occupations: as domestic
workers, entertainers -- often a euphemism for prostitutes, helpers
in restaurants and hotels, assembly line workers -- jobs that are
at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy, with inferior working
conditions and limited job prospects or security.
</P>
<P>
In particular, domestic service and entertainment are
frequently not covered by labour laws or social-security
regulations in most receiving countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, domestic workers are subject to a relationship
heavily in favor of employers due to the nature of the employment
and consequently vulnerable to exploitation. As for prostitution,
if it is not legalized in the host country, female migrants who go
into it would also face official harassment, raids and deportation.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the female labour export, evidence also showed that
it is a frequent practice that women are contracted to do
legitimate jobs but then forced into prostitution, and that women
are often victims of lucrative smuggling of immigrants, which
increases their vulnerability to exploitation and denies them from
legal recourse or official protection.
</P>
<P>
"public policy in most Asian countries is now oriented toward
diminishing the flows of migrant women workers, but the demand for
them in receiving countries is increasing and agencies are
proliferating to meet that demand," said Lin Lim, co-author of the
ILO report.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that however, official regulation often
drives the process further underground, and the effectiveness of
measures by sending countries is minimal if legislation and labour
standards are poor in receiving countries.
</P>
<P>
"Once migrants leave their home country," said Nana Oishi, an
ILO researcher, "the protection their own governments can provide
is very limited."

DAVOS, Switzerland, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A Lasting peace in
Bosnia cannot be possible without economic reconstruction, the new
Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Hasan Muratovic Sunday told a
news conference Sunday evening during the 1996 meeting of the World
Economic Forum (WEF) here.

</P>
<P>
As a result of the conflict over the past ??? years in the region,
only 1 percent of Bosnians are employed in productive jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, around 5.1 billion dollars, coming from the
World Bank and other donor nations, will be put on the region's most
urgent infrastructure projects, covering agriculture, roads, railways,
bridges, health care, education and industry.
</P>
<P>
A primary need is to clear agricultural land of mines, Bosnian
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Menem Upbeat About Trade Links with EU, NAFTA by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem said Sunday here that he sees excellent prospects for the
South American trade zone Mercosur to forge free trade links with the
European Union (EU) and the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects are excellent,... We go full steam ahead, and I hope by
2005, the EU-Mercosur free trade pact is operational and a
pan-American free trade agreement has been reached," Menem said at the
1996 Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Davos.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur countries, which also include Brazil, Uruguay and
Paraguay, agreed last December with EU to create a free trade zone
between them within a decade. Leaders of the NAFTA countries -- the
United States, Canada, Mexico -- also have agreed to negotiate a
pan-American free trade accord by 2005.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Menem also predicted an at least 5 percent economic
growth for Argentina this year after zero growth in 1995 due to the
impact of Mexico's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Argentina's economic situation, he said that Argentina had
brought inflation down to 1.7 percent last year from 5,000 percent
five years earlier through strict monetary and fiscal policies, and
rejected proposals for less tough anti-inflation policy in order to
bring down the high unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Serb Refugees Visit Homes in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Serb refugees
visited their homes in Mrkonjic Grad, Sipovo and villages in the
Kljuc, Jajce and some other municipalities in western Bosnia
today.
</P>
<P>
The visits were organized and the refugees travelled by bus and
car in convoys, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Commander of IFOR's fourth British armoured brigade Richard
Dannatt told a news conference at Mrkonjic Grad that land mines
and other explosive devices posed a great danger to those who
would live in these places.
</P>
<P>
Mrkonjic Grad was occupied by Croatia's and Bosnian Croat
troops on October 12 last year, a week after a general ceasefire
agreement was signed by the warring factions in Bosnia on October
5.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UNHCR Banja Luka office Vladimir Tsurko said his
office was taking necessary measures to help the return of
refugees, and was trying to make two schools and two hospitals
function again.
</P>
<P>
U.N. representative for civil affairs Ivan Betiar said it was
obvious that the devastation was not due only to military
operations but also pillaging and torching.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Mrkonjic Grad municipality Dragan Celic told the
news conference that factories, hospitals, medical centers,
schools, and all private dwellings had been plundered, and the
reconstruction would take a long time and cost a great deal.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Voices Concern over European Single Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Leon Brittan,
Vice-President of the European Commission, today warned that the
10-year-old European single market would be undermined were the
European Monetary Union (EMU) not realized by the planned 1999
launching date.
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that monetary developments of any kind could
put pressure on the single market," he told a press conference.
"Nothing in this world is irreversible," he added.
</P>
<P>
His remarks voiced similar concerns expressed by other European
leaders at the 1996 Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) held
in this small Swiss mountain resort.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, EU Commission President, said here Saturday
that the collapse of the EMU would be "a great step backwards and
I don't even know if the single market would survive such a blow."
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene also said here Saturday
that he doesn't think European countries that suffer from
"competitive devaluation" will accept the collapse of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Doubts about the EMU plan have been increasing recently because
the economic slowdown especially in Germany and France make it
difficult for countries expecting to join a future single currency
to meet the tough economic conditions spelled in the Maastricht
Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Gives Reasons For Nigeria Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the U.S.-based
"nation of islam" movement, Louis Farrakhan, has explained that
his group is in Nigeria in search of the true situation of
the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in
capital Abuja on Friday, Farrakhan said that the 30-member
delegation would also meet with the former presidential candidate
Moshood Abiola, who has been in detention since June 1994, and
other aggrieved parties in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We will in addition, look into the environmental conditions
in the oil producing areas of Rivers state and visit Ogoniland,
as well as hold talks with officials of the federal government of
Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and a few other western countries have imposed
sanctions against Nigeria over the detention of Abiola and the
November 1995 hanging of nine Ogoni activists for murder in South
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan noted that they are in Nigeria because "we have
heard a lot of news about Nigeria" and "we can at least say that
we came, we saw, we heard and discussed, in our quest for the
whole truth about the situation in the country".
</P>
<P>
"We want to see for ourselves the basis of some black leaders
and the American government conclusions about Nigeria so that we
can make a fair judgment, based on the whole truth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He therefore dismissed any perception of deception by the
government and those he referred as "clever deceivers", saying
the delegation would "listen to both sides in order to arrive at
a tangible conclusion".
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan told NAN that the movement hoped to make their
findings and report available to the congressional black causus,
as well as the Department of State of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The nation of Islam movement organised a "million-man march"
in Washington D.C. in October, to raise awareness on the plight
of African-Americans in the diaspora.
