FIDELITY FEDERAL'S PARENT ENDS ROUND OF RESHUFFLING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an effort to cut costs, the parent of Fidelity
Federal Bank said Monday that it has completed a management
shake-up that will save it $1.7 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the changes, Bank Plus Corp. said it will promote
three executives and not fill the posts they are vacating. The
moves were prompted by a third-quarter, $60 million loss in the
company's credit card division, a loss that prompted the U.S.
Office of Thrift Supervision to change its rating of the firm to
``adequately capitalized,'' from its previous ``well-capitalized''
classification. The lower rating makes Bank Plus subject to more
government scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Moving up the corporate ladder in the reshuffling is John
Michel, the company's director of strategic planning who will now
become chief financial officer. Also promoted were general counsel
Godfrey Evans, who will now serve as chief administrative officer,
and Richard Villa, the firm's controller who becomes Bank Plus'
treasurer. All appointments are subject to approval by the Office
of Thrift Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives and Mark Mason, who was named chief
executive officer in October, will form Bank Plus' executive
management team, replacing the former seven-member team and saving
the firm $1.7 million in annual compensation, the company said.
Should Bank Plus be sold, it would save the company an additional
$4.6 million in severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Plus reiterated Monday that it was looking for a buyer and
said all the changes are meant to help that effort. Bank Plus
shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $4.25.

GRIEB GRABS PAC-10 HONOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago UCLA's starting tight end, Brian
Richards, caught five passes in an offense that treated the
position as a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, UCLA's starting tight end, Mike Grieb, was named
first-team All-Pac-10 in voting based as much on respect as
receptions. Grieb has just 11 catches _ 25 less than Oregon's Jed
Weaver, the second-team selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the coaches respect a guy like (Grieb) because
they have to game-plan for him,'' Bruins quarterback Cade McNown
said. ``Anytime you have that much impact that coaches have to do
something, that's respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieb's spot on the first team was the only mild surprise for
UCLA, which placed eight players on the coaches' all-conference
team.
</P>
<P>
   They had two first-team offensive linemen, junior tackle Kris
Farris and senior guard Andy Meyers, and one second-team selection,
senior center Shawn Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   Junior receiver Danny Farmer, senior linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo and senior safety Larry Atkins were first-team
selections.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and Oregon's Akili Smith were named first-team
quarterbacks and co-offensive players of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Grieb said. ``A lot of it's based on
reputation from past seasons. I caught 20 passes last year and (19)
the year before. The coaches know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Close vote: Two first-team quarterbacks were picked for the
first time since 1982, when UCLA's Tom Ramsey and Stanford's John
Elway shared the honor.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and Smith had impressive credentials. Smith set a Pac-10
record with a passing efficiency rating of 170.4, while McNown has
guided the Bruins to an unbeaten season.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, Smith was the first-team pick until Toledo
lobbied for McNown on a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was picked prior to us talking, and we went from
there _ to not answer your question,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension: Toledo has suspended reserve cornerback Eric
Whitfield indefinitely for his involvement in the Oct. 4
altercation that caused Jermaine Lewis' one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo learned of Whitfield's participation through UCLA's
investigation of the incident. Whitfield admitted his involvement
in a meeting with Toledo on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A junior from Carson, Whitfield is the No.4 cornerback and plays
in certain passing situations. He will not play at Miami and his
status for the bowl game is undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Big mouth, big regrets: Ayanbadejo said he regrets postgame
remarks about USC quarterback Carson Palmer not being as good as
UCLA's scout-team quarterbacks, and he is considering sending a
note of apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him in front of the team and told him I was
embarrassed by his comments,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Shrug it off: The Bruins are treating Miami's 66-13 loss to
Syracuse as a fluke, much like their 66-3 victory over Texas last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to have a loss like that late in the season if the
team is composed of a lot of older guys,'' McNown said. ``But
they're young, and they can say, `This (week) is the start of next
year.' For an older team, it's tough to come back, but I think
they'll put a lot of that out of their minds pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has four senior starters _ three on offense, including
quarterback Scott Covington, and one on defense.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG formally announced Monday
its plan for a $10.1 billion takeover of Bankers Trust Corp. and
said the acquisition would result in the elimination of 5,500 jobs,
mostly in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, said the job cuts,
which would come from a combined work force of more than 20,000 in
the two cities, would not all be at Bankers Trust. Still, the cuts
would come at a time of Wall Street retrenchment, as Merrill Lynch,
J.P. Morgan and others have recently announced layoffs. About half
of Bankers Trust's 20,000 employees work in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Bankers Trust would be the largest foreign
takeover of an American bank and would vault Deutsche Bank over UBS
AG of Switzerland and the new Citigroup as the world's biggest bank
in assets. The deal is the most vivid illustration yet of how
banking has become more global, and it may be a precursor for
cross-border deals by others.
</P>
<P>
   In the announcement of the deal here on Monday, there were no
platitudes about a ``merger of equals'' or about the need for
deference to cultural and institutional differences. Breuer made it
clear he would shape the new enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in autonomy as an instrument of management
and leadership,'' Breuer said at a news conference. ``As far as it
goes, we want a centralized management of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   With that approach, Deutsche Bank is trying to avoid repeating
past mistakes. Over the last decade, it has spent freely to build
up its investment banking business _ with largely disappointing
results. It acquired the British investment bank Morgan Grenfell in
1989, and paid billions to acquire star bankers and to expand
operations in London and New York, giving the bankers wide freedom.
When costs began to soar, Breuer re-asserted control, and top
American executives defected.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating power in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank created waves
in New York and London. But Monday, Breuer seemed to be trying for
a straddling position that would maintain central control while
also retaining key executives on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company has committed some $400 million in bonus payments to
retain top Bankers Trust managers, including Frank Newman, chairman
and chief executive of Bankers Trust, who will be the only
executive receiving a seat on Deutsche Bank's management board.
Some Bankers Trust executives will receive $10 million or more each
to stay on. The boards of both companies approved the acquisition,
which had been expected for more than a week, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2.2 percent, to
104.65 marks ($61.77), as some analysts expressed skepticism about
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The goals Deutsche Bank has set for itself _ an increase in
earnings per share of 10 to 15 percent by 2001 _ are ``incredibly
ambitious,'' said Diane Glossman, a banking analyst at Lehman
Brothers Holdings. ``The greatest challenge will be consolidating
the cultures in a way that allows them to increase their earnings.
That's crucial, and it's an area where Deutsche Bank has dropped
the ball before.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bankers Trust rose 1.7
percent, to $87, still shy of the $93 a share offered by Deutsche
Bank. The stock has risen 21 percent since speculation of a deal
emerged on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes amid a wave of big international mergers by
German companies. Daimler-Benz has just completed its merger with
Chrysler Corp. Bertelsmann AG, the publishing and media
conglomerate, is buying the publisher Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deutsche Bank's agreement with Banker's Trust is only
one of three big deals this week. Hoechst AG, the chemicals giant,
has reached an agreement to merge its pharmaceutical and
agricultural businesses with those of Rhone-Poulenc of France. And
Viag AG, an industrial conglomerate in Munich, will merge with
Algroup of Switzerland in a deal worth $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the mergers reflect a new-found strength and
assertiveness in European corporations. But analysts say that many
deals are a sign of weakness, a need to shore up competitive lapses
that companies cannot resolve at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this is a corporate response to the difficulties at
growing earnings in a low-growth, low-inflation environment,'' said
George Hodgson, head of equity research at ABN Amro. Collectively,
he noted, the companies involved in this year's 10 largest European
mergers have underperformed the overall European stock market by
about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bankers Trust deal is expected to draw attention to several
lawsuits in the United States against the German bank over issues
of slave labor during World War II. Though Deutsche Bank did not
itself employ slave labor, it has been named along with industrial
giants like Siemens and Daimler-Benz. Lawsuits against Swiss banks
over wealth plundered by the Nazis led to a $1.25 billion
settlement last summer, largely because New York state regulators
insisted on an agreement before allowing the merged bank to operate
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi is considering filing a
lawsuit seeking to block the deal because of Holocaust issues,
people who have been briefed on the plans said Monday. Hevesi's
office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is subject to approval by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, but that is not expected to be a major obstacle. Deutsche
Bank does own a 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler, and while
common in Germany, ownership in industrial companies is prohibited
under U.S. banking laws. But Deutsche Bank, which said last week
that it was not planning to sell its stake, has an exemption to
this prohibition under legislation passed by Congress in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's desire for a big American institution has been
no secret. The bank's dominance at home has been eroded by
increasing competition, and big Wall Street investment banks like
Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs have been winning lucrative work
advising big European companies on mergers and acquisitions.
Deutsche Bank, which had been courting Bankers Trust since the
summer, is believed to have also actively looked at possible deals
with J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse Group, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust would give Deutsche Bank a middle-rank investment
banking firm. A subsidiary, BT Alex. Brown, continues to have a
strong franchise in bringing younger companies public, and Bankers
Trust itself has a sizable business in underwriting high-yield junk
bonds. Though junk bonds are still scarce in Europe, they are
attracting new interest as more companies undergo management
buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have a substantial business in trading
fixed-income securities, one of the few areas in investment banking
where Deutsche Bank has had real success. And both companies have a
big business in the obscure but lucrative area of custodial
services, the service of acting as a guardian for securities.
</P>
<P>
   But the takeover of Bankers Trust will not catapult Deutsche
Bank into the top ranks of American investment banks, a goal Breuer
has long had in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Breuer contended Monday that Bankers Trust was
Deutsche Bank's ideal partner. The combined company would become
the fourth-biggest money manager in the world, after UBS; Fidelity
Investments, the American mutual fund giant, and the Japanese
postal system's life insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many analysts Monday, Breuer insisted that he
had never wanted to take over a top Wall Street firm and disputed
widespread speculation that Deutsche Bank had settled on Bankers
Trust simply because it was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a response of the fox to sour grapes,'' Breuer
said, adding that his bank had ``never looked'' at so-called
``bulge-bracket'' investment banks at the top ranks of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulge-bracket banks are not universal banks like we are,''
he said. ``Deutsche bank would have in the end had to become a
completely different kind of bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will force Deutsche Bank to raise new capital to
shore up its balance sheet. That is because the $10.1 billion
purchase price for Bankers Trust is far higher than its tangible
value, which is about $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer said the bank would organize a new stock offering of 4
billion marks ($2.35 billion). Without elaborating, he said the
bank would raise additional money by issuing ``hybrid'' securities,
like convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now look forward to this next truly major step,'' said
Newman, who engineered much of Bankers Trust's expansion by
orchestrating the acquisition of Alex. Brown and other firms. ``I
don't speak German, at least not yet,'' Newman told a news
conference here Monday morning. ``I will take lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the organizational lineup leaves little doubt that Deutsche
Bank executives will be in charge. Breuer placed himself in charge
of the five-person ``transition team,'' and Newman is the only
person from Bankers Trust included.
</P>
<P>
   Though Breuer said he had no interest in additional American
acquisitions, he is still on the prowl in Europe. The bank has long
wanted to build a position in France, but the French government
remains hostile to foreign banks' acquiring French institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion in Europe is still in the offing,'' Breuer said.
Despite the $10 billion being paid for Bankers Trust, he added,
money would not be a problem. ``Our shareholders, if the story is
right, will be more than ready to furnish more money.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Their final four opponents are a combined 15-33, and their
magic number is down to two. But if the Cowboys regain their NFC
East crown, they'll likely do it with a host of second- and even
third-teamers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Cowboys returned to Valley Ranch on Monday following a
three-day hiatus, the training room was the most popular gathering
spot. The weekly injury report is nine players long, with the skill
and secondary positions the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   Only receiver Ernie Mills is clearly unavailable for Sunday's
game at New Orleans. Four players are listed as questionable,
including cornerback/receiver/returner Deion Sanders. Four are
listed as probable, though they aren't likely to be 100 percent. In
NFL terms, probable means there's a 75 percent chance the player
will play. Questionable means 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of guys go down, but that's not unusual
from how it is any other year,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said.
``Other guys just have to step in and perform at a pretty good
level for us to continue to have success.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be easy against some of the Cowboys' lesser opponents,
but a lack of cohesiveness might come back to haunt against others.
The 8-4 record this year is largely the result of a 6-0 mark
against woeful division opponents, whom Dallas again will face when
it hosts the Eagles and Redskins in the final two weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the Cowboys must travel to New Orleans
and Kansas City, both 5-7. To make matters worse, the Cowboys are
only 2-4 against non-division teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the rash of injuries is taking its toll. The biggest problem
spot has been at cornerback, where Sanders is suffering from a
sprained toe that kept him sidelined during last week's 46-36 loss
to Minnesota. On Monday, Sanders was wearing a boot cast on his
foot for the first time. His availability for the Saints should be
determined before the weekend, coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not out there by Thursday or Friday jogging around,
there's a high risk of reinjuring it, because he'll compensate,''
said Gailey, who would make no further comment on the likelihood of
seeing Sanders in action come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith, the Cowboys' other first-string cornerback, is also
listed as questionable with a back contusion, and backup corner
Kevin Mathis, recovering from a fractured right forearm, is
probable. Safety Darren Woodson, another stalwart of the secondary,
is listed as probable with a sprained left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Thanksgiving loss to the Vikings, the Cowboys
were down to their fourth and fifth cornerbacks, Terry Billups and
Charlie Williams. Billups was recently promoted off the practice
squad. Both could see significant playing time and perhaps even
start against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get some sense of stability in our defensive
backfield where we can get back in the groove, because I thought,
at one time, we were in the groove,'' Gailey said. ``I don't see it
as we've got horrible players on the field, or as our scheme. It's
kind of been a domino effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' last three opposing quarterbacks _ Arizona's Jake
Plummer, Seattle's Warren Moon and Minnesota's Randall Cunningham _
combined for 1,025 yards passing. Minnesota receivers Randy Moss
and Cris Carter could make a highlight film of their afternoon in
Dallas. Moss had touchdown catches of 56, 56 and 51 yards, his only
three receptions of the game, not including a two-point-conversion
catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who allowed Minnesota to score touchdowns on its
first three possessions, rank 26th in the league against the pass
after allowing the Vikings 353 yards through the air.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cowboys are counting on their offense to bail them
out, that, too, could be a struggle in the upcoming weeks. Depth is
again a question at receiver, where Mills remains out after
undergoing intestinal surgery. Backup Jeff Ogden went down with a
right-shoulder contusion against the Vikings and is listed as
questionable. Tight end Eric Bjornson struggled with a sprained
left ankle but is listed as probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts us,'' Aikman said of Ogden's injury. ``We're thin
at wide receiver anyway. Then to lose another guy thins us out even
more. But we'll work around it. We may not be able to do some
four-wide stuff because we don't have enough guys, but we'll get
around it and do some other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries leave Michael Irvin, Billy Davis and Patrick
Jeffers as the lone wideouts for Sunday's contest. And they're
coming off a game in which there were an uncharacteristic nine
drops by Dallas receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think with one game you start panicking,'' Aikman
said. ``That's not a problem that has generally happened with us.
Why it happened, I don't know. But I don't expect it to happen in
the future.''

FISET THE LONE BRIGHT SPOT
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ On a night of few positives for the Kings, at least
No.1 goalie Stephane Fiset got through a game without straining his
groin.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 3-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens at the Molson
Centre on Monday night marked Fiset's first appearance in nearly
five weeks, and for much of the night, he kept his team in the
game. He'd left his previous two starts after suffering groin
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel bad,'' said Fiset, who stopped 27 of 30 shots.
``Right now, maybe I'm a little bit tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Montreal's goals, one deflected past Fiset off the stick of
teammate Sean O'Donnell and two came when defensive mistakes by the
Kings resulted in outnumbered rushes by the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   But that was little consolation to Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to make the playoffs, we need to start winning some
games,'' he said. ``If we don't hurry, it's going to be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings ransom: Forbes magazine performed a survey of the values
of the 104 teams in the NHL, Major League Baseball, the NBA and the
NFL. The Kings were ranked 17th among the 27 NHL teams, with a
value of $104 million. The Mighty Ducks were 14th at $109 million.
The Canadiens were seventh at $167 million.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable NHL franchise is the New York Rangers at $195
million. The least valuable franchise in North American
professional sports is the Edmonton Oilers at $67 million. The
Kings are less valuable than all but two baseball teams (Montreal
and Minnesota) and two NBA teams (Milwaukee and the Clippers).
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The game was the last for radio color commentator
Cammi Granato until Dec. 19 in St. Louis. Granato is leaving this
week to join the U.S. women's hockey team for an upcoming
tournament in Finland. The U.S. will compete against Canada and
Finland at the tournament. Granato captained the U.S. to an Olympic
gold medal earlier this year. Former King Daryl Evans will take
Granato's place on the air while she is gone.... Enforcer Matt
Johnson, suspended for 12 games by the NHL for a recent assault on
New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, traveled with the Kings
on this trip so he could visit his family in Ontario.

ROBINSON STEAMED AS KINGS LOSE AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In the aftermath of the Kings' latest calamity, coach
Larry Robinson found a succinct way to describe the spot his team
finds itself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of tomorrows,'' Robinson said Monday
following a 3-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens before a Molson
Centre crowd of 20,415 on election night in the province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson is running out of patience _ with defensemen who
get caught out of position and with forwards who won't create
traffic in front of the net and accept the punishment that comes
with this basic task.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about this is another story, but Robinson did not
sound Monday like a man willing to go down with his sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to say, `Oh, it's not the right personnel,'''
Robinson said following the Kings' eighth loss in their past nine
games. ``But it comes to a point where, hey, how many chances can
you give them? Guys have been given a lot of chances to prove that
they can produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't produce, then it's going to come to a point
where (general manager) Dave (Taylor) is going to come to me and
say, `Hey, you know, either you get these guys going or we'll try
to get somebody else,' or I'm out of here. And I'll be damned if
I'm going to give up that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not being successful and it's not the players'
fault, then who's usually the fall guy? So all I'm saying is, I'll
be damned if I'm going to be the fall guy here. We're doing all
that we can and so maybe it is that we have to change some of the
personnel here. They've been given the chance. They can't say that
they haven't been given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest loss for the Kings (6-14-3), to a team that itself
had entered the game with seven losses in its past eight games, was
the usual unappetizing combination of bad luck and bad hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Saku Koivu scored the first goal for the Canadiens (8-12-2) on a
power play six minutes into the second period when, while falling
to the ice, he swatted the puck in front of the Kings' net.
Defenseman Sean O'Donnell, concerned about a Canadien behind him,
misplayed the puck, tapping it past goalie Stephane Fiset, playing
his first game after recovering from a pair of groin strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was stop it, cradle it, and fire it in the
corner,'' O'Donnell said. ``But it hit my stick, and you guys saw
what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third period, the Canadiens put the game away with
two goals 1:14 apart on 2-on-1s by Brian Savage and Martin
Rucinsky. Defenseman Philippe Boucher was caught up ice on the
first goal, and defenseman Mattias Norstrom was caught out of
position on the second.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray scored a meaningless goal with 3:33 to play,
enabling the Kings to avoid being shut out for the second straight
game and for the fifth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Robinson spoke of recalling such players as forwards
Greg Phillips and Chris Schmidt and defensemen Jaroslav Modry and
Jan Nemecek from the minors if the current crew doesn't soon shape
up. He said he would use center Brandon Convery on Wednesday in
Toronto, only Convery's second appearance since the Kings claimed
him on waivers from Vancouver on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to score goals unless we get guys that are
willing to pay the price in front of the net,'' Robinson said.
``We're absolutely getting no traffic in front. We can tell them to
go there and we can show them what they can do, but we're not
allowed to jump on the ice and grab them by the scruff of the neck
and place them in front of the net and say, `Hey, you've got to go
here.' They've got to get some intestinal fortitude and sacrifice
themselves by going to the front of the net, getting traffic there.
It's plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Kings this season, it's been easier said than done.

D-BACKS INVEST $52 MILLION TO WIN THE JOHNSON LOT TERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a striking new silhouette on the downtown skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, a 6-foot-10 flame-throwing left-hander who was
one of the top free agents this winter, agreed to a four-year,
$52.4 million contract with the Diamondbacks on Monday, making him
baseball's highest-paid pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Johnson gets a $5 million signing bonus. He will
receive $7.35 million in 1999 and $12.35 million in each of the
following three seasons. Part of the salary will be deferred until
his retirement. Arizona has a $12 million option for 2003 with a $3
million buyout. The option would increase to $15 million if he wins
the 2002 Cy Young Award and to $13.5 million if he's second through
fifth in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona won out over three other primary suitors who had made
similar offers _ the Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas
Rangers. The Diamondbacks now go from a 65-97 doormat in their
inaugural season to a team capable of making a strong run at the
National League West Division title.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Johnson, combined with the recent additions of
right-handed starters Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso,
left-handed middle reliever Greg Swindell and versatile role player
Greg Colbrunn, has increased the optimism among Arizona's
front-office and coaching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter welcomes the challenge of becoming an
instant contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, bring it on,'' he said. ``I'd rather have a lot of
expectations like that than no expectations at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in the Valley, will hold a news conference
Wednesday at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Barry Meister, who with Alan Nero represented Johnson, is
relieved that the monthlong tug-of-war is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Randy and I'm happy for the Diamondbacks and
their fans,'' Meister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two main goals here, and neither involved money.
One was, where would he be and find the most happiness for the rest
of his career and two, would there be an overwhelming commitment to
winning and getting a chance to get to the World Series. Arizona
has shown us a blueprint for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night, Jerry walked into Randy's living room and
said, `Bet on me. I'm going to make the club better.' He went out
and got Stottlemyre and Reynoso and said, `I'm not done,' and told
Randy, `I won't be done after I get you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The offers were just about equal. And Randy said, `All things
being equal, I'd rather be a Diamondback.' They involve the family.
They have a terrific manager, a nice mix of players . . .
hopefully, Randy can help drive the team forward so that in late
September, they'll be involved in two or three series that really
mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said his competitiveness led him to pursue Johnson and
the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exhilarating opening season for us,'' Colangelo
said. ``But we got our brains beat out too many times. We took a
lot of losses. I wondered what kind of honeymoon with the fans we
were going to have. I looked at the lay of the land and decided
that we had to go sooner rather than later, make more of an attempt
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a few pointed words for critics who say he is trying to
buy himself a pennant. The team's player payroll will rise from
$32.8 million in 1998 to the $53 million range, excluding deferred
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that really matters is reality, and what we are doing,
what Joe (Garagiola Jr., general manager), Buck and I, what
everybody is doing, is trying to compete. Why is it not OK for us
to do something and it's OK for the Yankees, or anybody else, for
that matter? I'll say again what I've said before _ if anybody asks
why, they should look in the mirror first and then go about their
own business.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first orders of business for Diamondbacks equipment
manager Chris Guth was to call Johnson's previous team, the Houston
Astros, about pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a 38-inch inseam,'' Guth said. ``They're probably so
long that we'll have to hang 'em outside the locker at the top
instead of inside. I think he's going to be fun to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The business of upgrading the club also includes trades, and the
Diamondbacks might be involved in some of those, particularly since
there now is a surplus of starters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Johnson, Stottlemyre and Reynoso, there is
right-hander Andy Benes, the team's top winner in 1998 with 14, and
left-handers Brian Anderson and Omar Daal. Anderson won 12 games
and finished as the majors' top pitcher in terms of fewest walks
per nine innings (1). Daal won eight games while finishing fifth in
the NL in ERA with 2.88.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have begun to circulate that Anderson, the team's top
pick in the expansion draft, and/or Daal could be involved in a
trade, with Arizona receiving a starting outfielder in return.
Anderson has heard the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three big horses now, and they certainly didn't sign
Armando for that kind of money ($5 million over two years) to put
him in the bullpen,'' Anderson said from his home in Ohio. ``So do
the math. I'm probably going be the guy to go. The Diamondbacks are
a class organization and I'd still like to be a part of it, but
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola could engineer a deal or two at the annual winter
meetings that begin Dec. 11 in Nashville. Or the team could sit
tight and see which teams want to add pitching, perhaps into the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson began his career with the Angels and then went to
Cleveland. He has admired Johnson's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to face him. Especially left-handed hitters. He
strikes fear,'' Anderson said. ``On days he would pitch against us,
some of the guys would say their knees had gotten a bit more sore
all of a sudden and wanted to sit out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has 2,329 career strikeouts and a 143-79 record, but
there is more to his success than his fastball, according to Kelly
Stinnett, who will be one of his new batterymates with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a nasty slider that he uses to set up the fastball
and can throw it at any point in the count,'' Stinnett said. ``He
can throw the slider down and in, then come back with a 96-mph
fastball on the outside part of the plate. That fastball can be
unhittable. It's kind of scary. I'm just glad I'll be back a few
extra feet so I'll have chance to see it and catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor said when the team faced
Seattle last spring, Johnson was working on a change-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely more mature, more of a pitcher than he was in
his early days with Montreal,'' Connor said. ``He used to be a
`spinner,' moving around in his delivery, but when he became more
squared up is when he had more success. What you want to do with a
guy like that is not change too much but help keep him on track
with the stuff that got him where he is.'' &QL;

<P>
   NAPA, CALIF. _ Gunfire is not a sound commonly associated with
the Napa Valley, California's celebrated wine-making area tucked
away in the hills north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it wasn't until an eruption of armed violence over
the past two weeks, in which nine teenagers have been treated for
gunshot wounds and the city of Napa has become America's latest,
and least likely, capital of crime.
</P>
<P>
   After months of simmering tensions, rival gangs of Latino
teenagers staged a bloody shoot-out in a run-down corner of the
city at the beginning of last week. Two days later, a gunman from
one of the gangs sought revenge by opening fire with a 22-caliber
automatic pistol on a line of high school students waiting for
their morning bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he hit his intended target, the 14-year-old brother
of one of the participants in the earlier fight, he also injured
two other teenagers standing next to him. The rest of the bus queue
fled in terror.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first outbreak of armed violence in Napa _
there have been sporadic incidents for a few months _ but it marked
a sharp escalation in the increasingly bitter feuds pitting
disenfranchised Latino teenagers against each other in one of the
most affluent corners of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was the first time that bystanders had got caught
up in the violence. And it has set Napa thinking that it might be
on the verge of an all-out gang war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is in jeopardy here, because of the wineries and the
tourist industry. They are going to have to find a solution to this
because if it runs out of control it will be a big, big problem,''
warned Gilbert Lopez, a former a gang member turned Pentecostal
minister who works the streets up and down the valley.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities have been extraordinarily cautious in their
comments, clearly terrified of the impact that any further violence
might have on the livelihood of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The police insist Napa is still a safe place to visit, and the
tourist office insists it has received no panic calls or booking
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   But for leaders of the Latino community, which does almost all
the menial work in the wine industry as well as the hotel and
restaurant trades but receives little if any recognition, it is
clear a crisis point has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel a great rage about what is going on, because they
feel they are essentially in an apartheid situation,'' said
Guillermo Brito, who runs a social services center called Nuestra
Esperanza. ``If the system keeps people down instead of helping
them to empower themselves, it is a recipe for major conflict down
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The scourge of gang violence has hit Napa in much the same way
that it has spread throughout California. Turf wars in Los Angeles
in the late 1970s and early 1980s led families to send children
susceptible to gang influence out of town, thus contributing
unwittingly to the dissemination of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In state prisons, Mexicans then divided themselves into two
clans, the Nortenos and the Surenos _ northerners and southerners.
Partly this was a matter of where they had settled in California,
the city of Bakersfield being the rough dividing line.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it was a matter of integration. Second- or
third-generation Latinos formed friendships with white Americans,
creating the Norteno gang together, and learned to look down on
Sureno newcomers, whom they call ``scraps'' or ``corns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Napa Valley, the two gangs do not fight so much over
territory or criminal rackets (although there are drugs around,
particularly methamphetamines known locally as ``crank``) as over
issues of identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortenos wear red, the Surenos blue, and they clash all
along the Napa River valley, from the city of Napa itself _ just
off the main tourist trail _ to the pretty town of Calistoga,
famous for its mud baths as well as its wine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the violence has taken the form of beatings, clubbings or
the occasional knife attack. Six months ago, though, Napa
experienced its first drive-by shooting, resulting in the death of
a 17-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   In Westwood, the Napa city neighborhood where the latest
violence has occurred, the situation is particularly explosive
because Nortenos and Surenos live on the same street blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For many Latinos in the Napa Valley, the gang violence is a
symptom of desperation experienced by young people with little to
fill their time and little to look forward to except a sense of
alienation from mainstream American society.
</P>
<P>
   There are few role models for them to look up to other than the
``cool'' gang leaders on the street. Only a tiny fraction of the
valley's schoolteachers and policemen speak Spanish, and fewer
still show much cultural understanding of their situation.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's main economic and political interest groups have
pressed for an end to the bad publicity before it damages the wine
and tourist industries and they have urged the police to catch the
culprits. One of two guns used in the recent shootings has now been
found, and an unnamed 17-year-old arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Such limited actions do not address the broader issues at stake
for the Latinos _ adequate wages, education and health care,
primarily _ and do little to bridge the gap between the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos already make up 80 percent of the valley's population,
and the proportion is growing. More than a quarter of pupils
registering at public schools are new arrivals fresh from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is in for a rude awakening,'' Brito said. ``It
depends on Mexicans for labor but offers them little or nothing in
return. The gangs are only one piece of a much larger problem.'' &QL;

   BRUSSELS _ Christmas will come early this year for Carlos Prade.
In a few week's time Rotterdam's newest residential home for
retired people will be ready and Carlos will be moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Peering through a pair of funky blue-tinted glasses Carlos
admits he is weary now. He wants to take it easy, let someone else
take the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Although a fresh-faced 59, he suffers from aches and pains, his
hands are shaking and he speaks in a whisper. His grip on reality
appears tenuous. He shuffles off in mid-conversation and then
suddenly says: ``I want to go to England. To see Elizabeth.'' Then
he breaks into a song.
</P>
<P>
   In the home, a converted townhouse, Carlos will have his own
room and bathroom. There will be television, a communal kitchen for
anyone capable of cooking. Round-the-clock medical care is
guaranteed as well as trained staff to look after his
``psycho-social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any official supply of dope heroin or cocaine.
But Carlos has no worries on that score. He is about to become the
first resident of the world's first old folks' home for drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Holland has the healthiest drug addicts in the world. So healthy
that they are turning into pensioners and the authorities have a
geriatric drug policy dilemma on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of Dutch drug users has risen to 36, the highest
in the world, and thanks to a policy based on health rather than
criminalization that is increasing by 10 months each year. In
Rotterdam alone at least 100 drug addicts have made it to the 55-
to 70-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But substance abuse takes its toll, and although they are living
longer, aging Dutch junkies are old before their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 55 or 60 they are displaying symptoms of people 20 years
older. Senility is common. They forget things and feel
threatened,'' explains Harry Kuiper of the Boumanhuis Foundation,
one of the biggest Dutch drug addiction agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most old people fret about keeping warm and getting to the shops
and the pension office. But Holland's geriatric junkies have the
added stress of having to hold their own on the drugs scene which
even in an ultra-tolerant society, where consumption is not
prosecuted, is run by criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Procuring narcotics, knowing when you are being fobbed off with
inferior stuff and finding enough money to keep the dealers happy
is not that easy when you have difficulty walking unaided.
</P>
<P>
   Now in response to a novel proposal from the Rotterdam
Junkiebond, the drug addicts union, the municipal health authority
has agreed to finance an old folks' home, devoted exclusively to
drug users, on a one-year pilot scheme basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a totally new development not just for the
Netherlands and Europe, but for the world,'' says Kuiper a keen
supporter of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on he says, to integrate the OAP junkies with ordinary
senior citizens because they might have difficulty finding
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most elderly people would tolerate a person taking a drink or
smoking a cigarette, but just one gram of heroin in an old peoples'
home and they would want you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Storm whose idea it was, has already given the residence a
name. ``Coconuts. One of the old men chose it,'' she says. ``He's
on coke and he's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   A formidable woman in her fifties, Nora is the Junkiebond
president and has turned her own home into a dwelling for junkies
of all ages. She runs a tight ship. Drugs are allowed in the rooms
but you must show you are making an effort to limit consumption and
you must find a job and pay your way.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration of Coconuts means she can at last stop worrying
about the granddaddies as she calls them. ``They can't cope. Their
brains are going and they leave on the gas sometimes. And they are
lonely. The music is not the same these days. They also have the
problem that their grandchildren won't visit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially the plan is to restrict the home to seven residents.
Out of their pensions they will pay a monthly rent. There will be
no pressure to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   So where will the drugs come from? ``It won't be a problem,'' is
all Nora will say. She foresees a growing demand for such
residences and insists that it should be up to the national health
service to take over the cost and running of them.
</P>
<P>
   Kuiper agrees. ``This is not an indulgence or an amusement,'' he
says. ``These people need special care.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The broad-minded Dutch approach to drug use is legendary but a
national old junkies' home plan may be a bridge too far.
Rotterdam's health authority is pioneering a controversial scheme
to distribute free heroin to serious addicts, but even here, the
location of the house is being kept a strict secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neighbors think it will attract drug traffickers to the area.
But we certainly don't want it to be in an isolated part of town,
cut off from the community,'' says Kuiper.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been running stories about how drugs will
be delivered each day by the home's in-house dealer _ a claim
flatly denied by all involved. ``There will be no buying or
selling. Not in the house,'' Kuiper says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' he sighs, ``it all comes down to an acceptance
of drug use. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether
we can accept elderly people using heroin, even in small amounts.
I'm not sure everyone can. This might be too much, even for
Holland.'' &QL;

O.J. JERSEY UNWANTED IN THE LONG RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News.) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You never know.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody out there wants a genuine, never-been-washed, USC
football jersey O.J. Simpson wore when he ran for 205 yards and
three touchdowns in a 28-16 win over UCLA 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kaye doesn't want it anymore. Neither does his nephew,
Mark Grobman, or Mark's father, Gene. They want to give the jersey
away to a charity to auction off or sell.
</P>
<P>
   They figure it would be dirty money they'd be collecting,
selling it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's much better that any money gained from selling O.J.'s old
college jersey go someplace where it could do some good. Maybe send
a message.
</P>
<P>
   Someplace like a shelter for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Once, this No. 32 jersey was the pride and joy of these
families. They laughed and pranced about in it, each trying on the
jersey for pictures that went into the family album.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they framed it and hung it up on a bulletin board above
young Mark's bed with a program from the 1968 USC-UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where it hung for almost two decades until Mark went
off to college and the jersey was returned to Uncle Mitch, who put
it away and forgot about it until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1994. Before the brutal deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a letter to O.J., care of NBC, where he was working as
a football commentator, to see if he wanted it back or wanted me to
give it to his favorite charity,'' Kaye said Monday, rummaging
through old boxes to find the jersey he had banished to the garage
after the slayings of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and
her friend Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a Burbank physical therapist, was a student at the
University of Southern California back in 1968, learning his future
trade by helping out the football team on the sidelines, taping
players' ankles and assisting team physicians.
</P>
<P>
   After the University of California, Los Angeles, game, when O.J.
set two NCAA season rushing marks, Kaye pushed through a crowd of
reporters waiting to talk to the running back outside the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he had to hurry up and get undressed because the
reporters were waiting,'' Kaye said. ``I helped him pull off his
jersey, and walked out of the locker room with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, I gave it to my sister for her wedding
anniversary because we were all big USC fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye isn't sure whether there is a statute of limitation on the
theft of football jerseys, but he's hoping it doesn't last longer
than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after trying to contact Simpson, via NBC, Kaye says
he got a call from O.J.'s secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he would want it back and for me to send it to him,''
Kaye said. ``I told her I didn't want to mail it, that I wanted to
give it to O.J. personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me he was out of town shooting a film, but when he
got back they'd try to find a date where we could meet, and I could
give him his jersey back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, other events precluded that meeting,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Simpson on Monday through his agent and
attorneys were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do now is give the jersey away to a charity,''
Kaye said. ``I don't want it around here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But that may be easier said than done. Betty Fisher, executive
director of Haven Hills, a nonprofit organization that houses and
counsels battered women and their children, expressed the majority
view of other charities and goodwill organizations I contacted
Monday about O.J.'s old jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It's tainted goods. They don't want to touch it. But they
wouldn't mind the money it might bring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody else auctioned off the jersey and donated the
money to us, I think I could justify that,'' Fisher said. ``But I
couldn't justify auctioning off the jersey ourselves. It just
wouldn't be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, there's such a chill on O.J. Simpson items right
now, according to sports memorabilia dealers, that they don't even
want to venture a guess on what his jersey might bring on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing (with) O.J. sells. Cards, you name it,'' says Richard
Khoury, co-owner of Sports Memorabilia Etc. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 1975 O.J. football doll set I can't give away.
People just aren't buying his stuff. At first (after the slayings)
everybody wanted it. Now they've backed away.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone is interested in having O.J.'s old college
jersey _ even just to throw darts at it _ give me a call at the
paper, (818) 713-3749, and I'll pass the offer on to Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   We'll make sure the money winds up someplace where it will do
some good and maybe send a message.
</P>
<P>
   Someplace like a shelter for battered women.

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ Germany's most persecuted minority hide behind an
answering machine. You leave a message, and wait for the
conspiratorial return call. Five days later, the phone rings at
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You called, Herr Crackers,'' a woman intones in a soft voice.
``We are the Messies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough time to grab a pen. The caller is
wrestling with a baby, and her two other small children are making
noises in the background. A perfect moment, then, to conduct the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Susanne Herms, she was teacher of English and
Religious Studies at a Gottingen grammar school before she started
planning a family. Now she is at home, and when she has some spare
time, she acts as the national coordinator for one of the
fastest-growing movements in the country: ``Messies Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an American organization, invented by a Florida housewife,
which in Germany has found fertile soil. In just over two years, 40
local groups of ``Messies Anonymous'' have sprung up, organized _
if that is the right word _ by 300 contact persons.
</P>
<P>
   Herms, and the toddler who occasionally screams ``Mamma'' into
the receiver, are at the apex of this pyramid. What they and the
army of anonymous supporters who meet in secret locations up and
down the country have in common is their shameful secret: they are
disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   They rally behind the English word ``messy'' because the German
language does not have an equally forgiving equivalent. In their
native tongue their crime is ``Unordnung,'' the opposite of
``Ordnung,'' or order.
</P>
<P>
   Ordnung is what all Germans aspire to. To be lacking in Ordnung
is akin to being afflicted with bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a joke,'' Herms says. ``Many people laugh when you
miss an appointment or can't find your things. But there are
dramatic cases: people whose personal relationships break down
because of their Unordnung.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not punctual, you can lose your job. And you can
lose your friends if you don't dare to let them into your house,
because you're too messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you would never believe it, an estimated 10 percent of
Germans suffer from this ailment, and their numbers are rising.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists are coming to the conclusion that
disorganization is an inherited trait, the erosion of social
conventions is also blamed for increasing manifestations of this
aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity and loose morals are wreaking havoc. A whole
generation of Germans has grown up never once having been clipped
around the ear for smudging the door handle in the kitchen. Some
others have, but they force themselves to be messy as a token of
rebellion against parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, young Germans protested against the world of
their elders by becoming urban guerrillas. Today they do it by
walking around with untied shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   As the traditional society unravels, great changes are in store.
Soon it may no longer be commonplace to see the womenfolk of your
neighborhood sweeping the pavement in front of their houses at 8:25
every morning with a small broom and dustpan. There might even be a
noticeable decline in car hygiene in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, though, the disorganized must keep their
disability in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Germany are successful at work, but they
hide their disorganized home life,'' Herms says. Those who want to
come out can go to meetings of ``Messies Anonymous,'' to meet
like-minded people and receive tips on how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   This being an American movement, there are sure-fire cures,
developed by its patron saint, Sandra Felton. She has identified
three types of messies: the ``hoarder,'' the ``time messy'' and the
``chaos worker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the German environment, the second syndrome is the most
socially crippling. Once the malady is diagnosed, each sufferer is
offered a cure of his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about the advance of American civilization in the
late 20th century that even the Germans are turning to a Florida
guru to learn about ``Ordnung.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, for once, is sadly lagging behind in domesticating this
bit of Americana. Despite the obviously higher proportion of slobs

   ``According to the British publishers, this book doesn't suit

<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-1984, a former Egyptian Army officer with an engaging
manner and a gift for languages approached the CIA in Egypt with
what seemed an intriguing offer: He volunteered to be a spy.
</P>
<P>
   The agency tried him out, but the Egyptian flunked. He had made
contact in Germany with a branch of Hezbollah, the Middle Eastern
terrorist group, and told its members that he was working with the
CIA, a betrayal the agency quickly discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, CIA officials branded him untrustworthy and cut off
further dealings with him, suspecting that he wanted to help the
terrorists spy on Americans, United States officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency discovered the next year that the former officer, Ali
A. Mohamed, was trying to enter the United States, and officials
put his name on a State Department ``watch list'' intended to
prevent terrorists and other security threats from getting visas,
an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mohamed evaded this precaution and persuaded an American
Embassy official to give him a visa, the CIA issued a second
warning to other federal agencies that a suspect person might be
traveling to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings were not heeded. Mohamed emigrated to the United
States and in the next decade cultivated a range of useful
relationships with the American government. He enlisted in the army
and served with one of its most elite units. Then, in the early
1990's, he became an informant for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is imprisoned in a high-security cell in New York City
on suspicion of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
suspected of masterminding the August bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa. Prosecutors filed the charges against him
in secret, and law enforcement officials have declined to discuss
the case even after its existence was made public last month.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to learn whether he has contested the
charges or pleaded guilty, and his lawyer, James Roth, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mohamed's dealings with the United States, based on
interviews with associates, government officials and former army
officers, suggests that he was inexorably drawn to intrigue and the
shadowy gambits of espionage. Along the way, several officials
said, the American authorities missed opportunities to grasp the
depth of his allegiance to Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials said Mohamed forged ties with bin Laden
as early as 1991. He was adept at obtaining false documents for bin
Laden's organization, the officials said, and assisted with
logistical tasks, like bin Laden's 1991 move from Afghanistan to
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department granted Mohamed's visa to enter the United
States in 1985, only a year after the CIA severed ties with him.
State Department officials, reached late in the day Monday, were
unable to confirm or deny accounts of the circumstances surrounding
Mohamed's entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While serving in the army as a supply sergeant assigned to
Special Forces, his aggressive support for Islamic causes and open
curiosity about intelligence matters raised eyebrows among
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the most notable of those incidents, Mohamed took a few
weeks' leave from the army base at Fort Bragg, N.C., and told
friends that he planned to join the mujahedeen rebel forces in
Afghanistan and ``kill Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning, he boasted of his combat exploits to colleagues
at the army's Special Warfare School, prompting two of his
supervisors to file reports with Army officials at Fort Bragg and
with Army intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   An Army official, citing inaccessibility of the records, said
Monday night that he could not address how the service had
investigated the reports or whether it had taken any action against
Mohamed. The official added that because the matter had entered the
court system, comment would be inappropriate. American officials
now believe that Mohamed did fight with the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, shortly before he was honorably discharged from
the army, Mohamed began traveling to the New York City area and
training a circle of Islamic militants in basic military
techniques. Members of the group, which was centered in Brooklyn,
were later convicted of plotting a series of terrorist attacks in
New York, including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Mohamed was fully enmeshed in a dual life.
He was simultaneously collaborating with bin Laden's organization
and talking regularly with federal agents about bin Laden and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   His story, American officials say, is a modern espionage parable
in which Mohamed was trying to manipulate American investigators
even as they were using him to gain a window into the activities of
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's arrest surprised some, but not all those who have
known him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me on several occasions that he would never betray the
United States, as far as breaking United States law or trying to
undermine the government,'' said Lt. Col. Steven Neely, former
director of Middle East studies at the special warfare school. ``He
was in many, many ways as loyal a soldier as you'd find coming off
the farm in the Carolinas or out of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Another United States official familiar with his career
disagreed, saying his identity as an American was always less
important than his devotion to Islamic fundamentalism. ``You could
sit and have lunch with him, and he'd be as nice as pie. But if the
call came in to blow you up, there is no question in my mind that
Ali would blow you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed was born in Egypt in 1952. After graduating from high
school in 1971, he enrolled in a Cairo military academy and then
joined Egypt's army.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, he made his first visit to the United States
when he was sent to Fort Bragg to be trained by American soldiers.
U.S. intelligence officers often use such programs to spot possible
recruits, but administration officials say the CIA did not approach
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say his duties with the Egyptian army
included recruiting informants for his country's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   His later years in the military coincided with a time of great
turmoil in his native land.

   BONN _ Germany's most persecuted minority hide behind an
answering machine. You leave a message, and wait for the
conspiratorial return call. Five days later, the phone rings at
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You called, Herr Crackers,'' a woman intones in a soft voice.
``We are the Messies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough time to grab a pen. The caller is
wrestling with a baby, and her two other small children are making
noises in the background. A perfect moment, then, to conduct the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Susanne Herms, she was teacher of English and
Religious Studies at a Gottingen grammar school before she started
planning a family. Now she is at home, and when she has some spare
time, she acts as the national coordinator for one of the
fastest-growing movements in the country: ``Messies Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an American organization, invented by a Florida housewife,
which in Germany has found fertile soil. In just over two years, 40
local groups of ``Messies Anonymous'' have sprung up, organized _
if that is the right word _ by 300 contact persons.
</P>
<P>
   Herms, and the toddler who occasionally screams ``Mamma'' into
the receiver, are at the apex of this pyramid. What they and the
army of anonymous supporters who meet in secret locations up and
down the country have in common is their shameful secret: they are
disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   They rally behind the English word ``messy'' because the German
language does not have an equally forgiving equivalent. In their
native tongue their crime is ``Unordnung,'' the opposite of
``Ordnung,'' or order.
</P>
<P>
   Ordnung is what all Germans aspire to. To be lacking in Ordnung
is akin to being afflicted with bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a joke,'' Herms says. ``Many people laugh when you
miss an appointment or can't find your things. But there are
dramatic cases: people whose personal relationships break down
because of their Unordnung.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not punctual, you can lose your job. And you can
lose your friends if you don't dare to let them into your house,
because you're too messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you would never believe it, an estimated 10 percent of
Germans suffer from this ailment, and their numbers are rising.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists are coming to the conclusion that
disorganization is an inherited trait, the erosion of social
conventions is also blamed for increasing manifestations of this
aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity and loose morals are wreaking havoc. A whole
generation of Germans has grown up never once having been clipped
around the ear for smudging the door handle in the kitchen. Some
others have, but they force themselves to be messy as a token of
rebellion against parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, young Germans protested against the world of
their elders by becoming urban guerrillas. Today they do it by
walking around with untied shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   As the traditional society unravels, great changes are in store.
Soon it may no longer be commonplace to see the womenfolk of your
neighborhood sweeping the pavement in front of their houses at 8:25
every morning with a small broom and dustpan. There might even be a
noticeable decline in car hygiene in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, though, the disorganized must keep their
disability in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Germany are successful at work, but they
hide their disorganized home life,'' Herms says. Those who want to
come out can go to meetings of ``Messies Anonymous,'' to meet
like-minded people and receive tips on how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   This being an American movement, there are sure-fire cures,
developed by its patron saint, Sandra Felton. She has identified
three types of messies: the ``hoarder,'' the ``time messy'' and the
``chaos worker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the German environment, the second syndrome is the most
socially crippling. Once the malady is diagnosed, each sufferer is
offered a cure of his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about the advance of American civilization in the
late 20th century that even the Germans are turning to a Florida
guru to learn about ``Ordnung.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, for once, is sadly lagging behind in domesticating this
bit of Americana. Despite the obviously higher proportion of slobs
residing across the Channel, Felton's book, published 16 years ago,
has bombed in Britain.

UNDATED: native land.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981 by Islamic
radicals in the Egyptian military was followed by brutal crackdowns
on local extremists and their followers. Among the targets were
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind cleric who eventually emigrated
to Brooklyn, where he was convicted of conspiring to blow up the
United Nations and other New York landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed later confided to friends in the U.S. Army that he was
deeply upset by the Egyptian government's hard line, and that he
felt aligned with the Islamic radicals who carried out the
assassination of Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   One of his supervisors, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, recalled a
disagreement he had with Mohamed about the legacy of Sadat, an ally
of the United States who had signed a historic peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Anwar Sadat was a true patriot, and he gave
his life,''' Anderson recalled. ``And he said, `Anwar Sadat was a
traitor and had to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian army, Mohamed would later tell his American
friends, was hostile to devout Muslims. In March of 1984, having
attained the rank of major, he left the military, according to his
American military records.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, it was roughly about this
time that Mohamed made his first overture to the CIA in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was tentatively accepted by the agency, which was
gearing up for a global fight against terrorism. The bombings of
the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 put
pressure on the agency to recruit more agents in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands were stepped up in March 1984, when terrorists
linked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah kidnapped William Buckley,
the CIA station chief in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   After the CIA agreed that he could work with the agency, Mohamed
made contact with a group of Hezbollah adherents in Germany,
according to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the agency learned that Mohamed had taken that
opportunity to reveal to the terrorists that he was working for the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Mohamed set out to be a double agent on
his own, or whether he was at this point acting under the influence
or instructions of an Islamic group. The CIA, however, decided to
have nothing more to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials now say Mohamed knew he had been cut off
by the agency, which never gave him a reason. After he came to the
United States, he told friends that he had worked with the CIA in
Germany and hoped to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Egyptian army, Mohamed went to work briefly
for EgyptAir as a security adviser. Then, for reasons that remain
somewhat unclear, he decided to emigrate to the United States.
Explaining the decision later at Fort Bragg, he told other soldiers
that he had come to this country for religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the CIA learned that he was trying to obtain a visa,
and it put his name on the State Department list of people who
should be kept out of the country. American officials overseas have
extensive authority to reject visa applications, particularly if
security concerns are raised.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed got his visa, and when the CIA found out, it sent a
second warning to federal agencies about the possible security
threat, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed arrived in New York on Sept. 6, 1985, and eventually
settled in California.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to
the Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, where the Army trains
its Special Forces. The base is also home to the elite
anti-terrorist commando unit known as the Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-born people are permitted to join the American military,
provided they have attained permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mohamed was not a member of the Special Forces, he
worked as a company supply sergeant, trained as a paratrooper, and
received high marks for his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have separated yourself from your peers, and I have taken
notice,'' Capt. Brian Layer wrote in a December 1987 commendation
letter praising Mohamed's performance on a physical readiness test.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow soldiers recall the powerfully built Mohamed as a
rigorous and dedicated soldier who seemed eager to learn and who
joked about having gone from being a major in the Egyptian Army to
a ``lowly sergeant'' at Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Hebrew, French and English, as well as Arabic, he
would assist other soldiers in translations, friends there said. He
went for long runs and listened to the Koran on his Walkman. He
enjoyed cooking, and had his meat butchered in accordance with
Islamic practice, one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that Mohamed was no ordinary immigrant soldier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he told his colleagues of his plans to take several
weeks of leave and fight in Afghanistan against the Soviet forces.
It was an audacious proposal for an active-duty soldier.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies were in the midst of a
multibillion-dollar program to aid the Afghan rebels, and the CIA
had taken considerable pains to conceal the American role. The
capture or death of an American serviceman in Afghanistan would
have been a major international embarrassment to the United States.

   Anderson, Mohamed's supervisor, said he told him not to make the
trip. But Mohamed replied that he planned to circumvent the Army's
restrictions by flying to Paris on his American passport and then
using other documents to travel from the Middle East to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he and another officer had written a detailed
intelligence report to their military superiors, but heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, Mohamed returned, bringing with him what he
said was war booty. Anderson said he had shown him two belts
purportedly taken from Soviet special forces soldiers he had killed
in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials are convinced that Mohamed fought
with the rebels, there is no specific evidence that he killed
Russian soldiers. Such belts were widely available in local
bazaars.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his colleague were deeply troubled by his
statements, and they wrote another intelligence report that
provided further details about what Mohamed had told them about his
time in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The other officer said he had no doubt Mohamed had fought with
the rebels. ``He had probably lost 20, 25 pounds,'' the officer
said, ``which indicated to me that he had done something fairly
strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on
the condition of anonymity, citing the allegations of terrorism in
the case and other security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed made no secret of his trip, and even boasted of his
dealings with Afghan rebel leaders. He thanked another officer,
Capt. Michael Asimos, for providing him with some unclassified maps
of Afghanistan before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Ali coming back at some point in 1988,'' Captain
Asimos recalled, ``and telling me how much Ahmad Shah Massoud was
pleased that I took him some maps.'' Massoud led one of the
mujahedeen groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Mohamed had a relationship with any
terrorist organization while he was in the army. In retrospect,
some of his colleagues say, he had an unusual interest in
classified matters.
</P>
<P>
   Asimos ran a classified war game at Fort Bragg in 1988 that
involved military and intelligence officers from all over the
country. He said he had told participants to be careful of what
they said in front of Mohamed, who did not hold a security
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can specifically remember Ali coming down and saying I want
to be involved in this, I want to help, I have a great deal of
knowledge here,'' Asimos recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his service in the Army, Mohamed asked to be
introduced to the CIA's representative at Fort Bragg, a former army
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, unaware that Mohamed already had a history with the
agency, recalls telling the CIA official that Mohamed ``has this
burning desire to be utilized as an intelligence operative, and
you're the logical guy to look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted about an hour, the Army officer recalled.
Afterward, he said, the CIA official joked that Mohamed might
already be a ``spook,'' using the slang term for a foreign
espionage agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of laughed,'' the officer said. ``How ridiculous
that this guy could possibly be a spook matriculating in this sort
of bastion of special operations activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, officers at Fort Bragg cast Mohamed as the star of a
series of training videotapes intended to give soldiers a taste of
how Islamic radicals view the world.
</P>
<P>
   On one tape, he says of Israel, ``From the Islamic perspective,
nobody can recognize Israel has the right to live, because Israel
stole an Islamic territory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not accept no peace,'' he adds. ``No international
conference. Nothing. No compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Mohamed apparently began working more closely
with Islamic extremists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared from Fort Bragg on weekends, traveled to the New
York area and offered military training to several militants
associated with a refugee center in Brooklyn. He often stayed with
El Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted of killing
Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors now assert that the refugee center was the principal
base in the United States for bin Laden's group, Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed met the local Muslims at an apartment in Jersey City,
and taught them survival techniques, map reading and how to
recognize tanks and other Soviet weapons, according to testimony by
one of his students at Nosair's 1995 federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed left the army in November 1989, obtained his U.S.
citizenship, and spent the next few years shuttling between New
York, California, Afghanistan and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known when he first met bin Laden. According to
American officials, however, at some point in 1991 the Saudi exile
asked him to help with a crucial task: moving his base of
operations from Afghanistan to the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said this was a complex operation, involving
the transfer through several countries of bin Laden and at least
two dozen associates. At the same time, Mohamed frequented mosques
in the United States, and American officials now suspect that he
was recruiting operatives for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1992, Mohamed returned to fight in Afghanistan,
training rebel commanders in military tactics, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials said, a series of bizarre
incidents brought him to the attention of the FBI. In 1992, Mohamed
was detained by the authorities at the Rome airport when suspicions
were piqued by his luggage, which had false compartments.
</P>
<P>
   He assured interrogators that he was on their side in the war on
terrorism, and claimed he was involved in security for the Summer
Olympics in Barcelona, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he was stopped by the border authorities in
Canada while traveling in the company of a suspected associate of
bin Laden's who was trying to enter the United States using false
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Mohamed was questioned by the FBI, which had learned
of his ties to bin Laden. Apparently in an attempt to fend off the
investigators, Mohamed offered information about a ring in
California that was selling counterfeit documents to smugglers of
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, U.S. officials say, Mohamed provided some
information about his movements and about bin Laden, who was
becoming a focus of a New York-based inquiry touched off by the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and other plots.
</P>
<P>
   The government tracked his movements and phone calls, officials
said, as they assembled evidence that suggested that bin Laden was
a far more important figure in international terrorism than had
previously been understood.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after bombs exploded outside the American Embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, last August, killing
more than 200 people and wounding more than 1,000, Federal
prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed Mohamed to testify before a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   He flew to New York in September, made his appearance, and was
arrested. Officials believe he was on his way to the Middle East.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Everywhere you go in Tokyo _ hanging from the straps on
crowded underground trains, in cafes, restaurants, and in parks _
you will come across people reading ``manga,'' the plump, pulpy
Japanese comic books.
</P>
<P>
   There are kids' manga about sci-fi robots, sentimental ``ladies'
manga'' about young women looking for romance, and graphic
gentlemen's manga, featuring a different kind of lady in various
states of undress.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's most fashionable and original comic book could
hardly be more different: it is 400 pages long, packed with dense,
polemical text and bears the solemn title of ``Sensoron: Theory
About The War.''
</P>
<P>
   Its author is Yoshinori Kobayashi, a lean, bespectacled young
intellectual, a frequent guest on television discussion programs
and the principal character of his own comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, compiled from his bi-monthly contributions to a
popular magazine, Kobayashi orchestrates historical argument,
dramatized scenes of past and present, and horrible caricatures of
his intellectual adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   It all presents a simple message: that, contrary to the view
propagated in the West, Japan's invasions of Asia during the
Pacific War were not the brutal actions of a predatory colonizer.
They were a noble and valiant undertaking, carried out with
discipline and restraint, and their effect was to liberate Asians
from the colonial dominance of Western imperialists.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, a group of former Allied PoWs left Tokyo
bitterly disappointed after losing their claim for compensation and
apology. The pages of ``Sensoron,'' it is fair to predict, would
leave them in despair.
</P>
<P>
   A typical sequence of frames shows ugly Caucasians with fat lips
and outsized noses sticking Union Jacks, Stars and Stripes and
Tricolors into a map of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the next box, stern but noble Japanese soldiers surge across
the map, snapping the puny flags to the chagrin of the hideous
whiteys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white Western countries thought of colored people like us
as primitive monkeys and colonized the countries of East Asia,''
runs the text. ``It was the Japanese army which beat them. Let's
give them a round of applause.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a strain of such thinking in Japan _ in
Tokyo and most big cities, so-called ``rightists'' can be seen
every day blaring martial music from black trucks painted with
rising suns, and eulogizing the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the din, few Japanese regarded them as more than noisy
middle-aged eccentrics. Kobayashi, by contrast, is young,
widely-read and cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the success of his comic has fostered a
surprising and in some ways an alarming trend _ a revival of
right-wing revisionism about Japan's war among the youngest and
cleverest Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to talk to my friends about these things, but
it's all changed in the last two years,'' says Tomomi Yamada, a
26-year old magazine editor, and a fan of ``Sensoron.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Japanese, and you start raising questions about
Japan in the war, people always used to point the finger and say,
`rightist!' Now my friends talk about it and a lot of them agree
with me. It's terrific, and Kobayashi has had a big influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's right-wing revival has little in common with those of
Europe and _ with her polite English and fluffy sweater _ Ms.
Yamada could hardly be further from a drooling neo-Nazi. Once a
month she attends a meeting of the Japan Public Opinion Society, a
discussion group of like-minded people, to hear speeches by
conservative historians.
</P>
<P>
   These days as many as half the members of the audience are her
own age; when she first attended, three years ago, very few were.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the speakers were saying was so different from what we
were taught in school, that Japan fought an aggressive war,'' she
says. ``It was shocking and new, and very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent subject of discussion is the 1937 Rape of Nanking.
According to most Western and many Japanese historians, the
imperial army embarked on an orgy of killing, looting and rape
which left at least 100,000 dead _ the Chinese reckon it could have
been as many as 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill 300,000 you would need two nuclear bombs,'' asserts
Kobayashi. ``It couldn't be done with Japanese guns.''
</P>
<P>
   His book has gone through 17 printings and some 400,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's most successful Japanese film was ``Pride,'' an epic
eulogy to Hideki Tojo, the wartime prime minister hanged as a war
criminal 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over a million copies have been sold of a series of books
entitled ``The History Which The Textbooks Don't Teach,'' by a
group of revisionist historians irritated with the increasingly
liberal tenor of history teaching in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are depicted as criminals on whose shoulders fate
has placed the burden of atoning for their sins for generations to
come,'' says one of the authors, Professor Nobukatsu Fujioka of
Tokyo University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current Japanese textbooks include the wartime propaganda of
former enemies, treating it as though it were historical fact.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Unlike Western neo-Nazis, Japanese revisionists have never
turned their intellectual agenda into any kind of political action,
and the numbers of committed activists is probably small, even if
their influence is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends very much on social conditions, and whether the
economic situation gets worse or not,'' says Tesuya Miyazaki, a
writer who frequently speaks out against Kobayashi and his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-war period everyone in Japan thought of themselves
as middle class, but now things are changing and gaps are opening
up between the top and bottom, and between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the confusion that Kobayashi speaks to _ it's not that
people are trying to revive the spirit of the war, just a feeling
of togetherness.'' &QL;

CARDINALS BEGIN AUDITIONS TO REPLACE INJURED NEDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Jacke and Cole Ford will be the men on the spot today when
they audition for the Cardinals' place-kicking job, according to
league sources.
</P>
<P>
   Injured Cardinals kicker Joe Nedney also planned to be there,
hoping to see something that will ease both his and the team's
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney's season likely came to an end during the fourth quarter
of Sunday's 34-24 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He suffered what
initially was diagnosed as a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee when his cleat hung up while being blocked on a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney and middle linebacker Ron McKinnon, who suffered a
sprained knee during the game but continued to play until the late
stages, underwent magnetic reasonance imaging Monday, but the
results weren't available because team physician Russell Chick was
in surgery most of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were on crutches Monday at the Cardinals' training
facility. While McKinnon said he thought he might be able to play
by Sunday, a team source said it didn't ``look good.'' Nedney
talked like a man who knows his season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's the best-case scenario and I just have a sprained
knee, I'll be out for four games and that's all that are left,'' he
said, sounding despondent. ``If there is any way I could be back in
five weeks and play in a playoff game, I would be there in a
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my absence be the missing piece to whether or not
we make the playoffs, so I really hope somebody comes in and steps
up and help this team get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a native of Tucson who starred at Sabino High School
before going to Southern Cal and on to a three-year career with the
Oakland Raiders, has made 33 of 35 extra points and 45 of 62
field-goal attempts, with a career-long 53-yard effort.
</P>
<P>
   Ford spent the first two weeks of this season as Buffalo's
kickoff specialist but was released.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, who has playoff experience, spent eight years with the
Green Bay Packers and played one game last December with Washington
before being released after the season. He has made 306 of 311
extra points and 173 of 224 field-goal attempts during his career,
while connecting on field goals of 50 yards or more eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the job will have to handle both place-kicking and
kickoffs. Kickoffs, vital in the battle for field position, aren't
considered a strength for either kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever comes in will handle them both because we kind of
found out that (punter) Scott Player isn't a great kickoff man,''
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``We would like to have a guy who
can do both, but if I have to chose one over another, I would opt
for the guy you are sure can kick it through the uprights. That's
how you get points.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney knows exactly what Ford and Jacke will go through today.
He said he has been through five or six auditions himself during
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real gong show,'' he said. ``It's nerve-racking. If you
miss one and the other guy makes one, you start pressing and
watching the coach who is doing the evaluating and writing
something down. It's like taking a driving test while somebody
writes things down and tells you when your done if you passed or
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who said he had never had a kicker suffer a serious knee
injury, labeled Nedney's loss disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was really becoming a consistent kicker,'' he said. ``Fans
and the media only see the kicking he does in games, but we watch
him kick five field goals a day in game-type situations. It's not
live but we have a rush and I've seen his consistency increase
dramatically during the year. He range has also increased
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly for Joe as a person because he has worked
extremely hard to become a consistent kicker, and this is
definitely a setback to him.''
</P>
<P>
   While ACL injuries once meant a full year out, improved surgical
procedures have lowered that time by as much as six months. Nedney
said he's heard it's even less for kickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way my leg swings, the ACL is not as important, and I've
heard it takes about three or four months,'' he said. ``If I need
the surgery, I want to get it done as soon as possible because I
plan to be ready for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once in my career, I think I have some stability with this
organization. I've worked hard and I don't think they will let it
go unnoticed.'' &QL;

JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR HALL TO SWIM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. apparently will be in the starting blocks this
morning at a key international swimming event after a federal judge
in Phoenix issued a restraining order late Monday against the
federation that sought to ban him because of marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Roger Strand issued the emergency order
after Hall's lawyer argued that FINA, the Swiss-based federation,
had effectively sought to double the three-month suspension
punishment it imposed upon Hall in June.
</P>
<P>
   Strand convened the hearing shortly after 5 p.m., accepting the
emergency request by Ed Hendricks and Michael Ross, lawyers for
Hall. Hendricks said Hall's appeal of the suspension was rejected
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hall already had been barred from two international
competitions in the summer, Hendricks said that unless Strand
intervened, Hall would be unable to swim in two events this week in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a world-class swimmer with two gold medals and
you can't swim in major international events, you are not going to
be prepared for the next Olympics,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Strand granted the order after trying unsuccessfully to contact
a FINA representative by telephone in Lausanne, Switzerland, where
the local time was past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But after expressing concern that by allowing Hall to swim, he
might be knocking another swimmer out of the water, the judge
ordered Hall's attorneys to be back in court at 7:15 this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Strand's decision to revisit the issue apparently held open the
possibility that he could rescind his restraining order before Hall
swims. Hendricks said Hall was scheduled to swim at 8 or 9 a.m.
Phoenix time. He said Hall also is scheduled to swim this weekend
at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hall received his three-month ban in mid-May. But in mid-August,
after Hall had missed the Goodwill Games and U.S. Senior Nationals,
FINA suspended the ban while it was reviewed by its doping panel.
</P>
<P>
   The panel last month restored the ban, giving Hall credit for
only two months. Hall's final appeal to the Court of Arbitration
for Sport was denied Monday, setting the stage for the hearing
before Strand. &QL;

INJURIES MAY FORCE CARDI NALS TO SHUFFLE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If middle linebacker Ron McKinnon, who suffered what is believed
to be a sprained knee in Sunday's loss to Kansas City, doesn't play
on Sunday, it could force several changes in the Cardinals'
struggling defense.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's backup, Mark Maddox, missed the Kansas City game
because of a knee problem, but Coach Vince Tobin believes he will
return for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked Jamir Miller and Terry Irving at that spot and
when Ronnie couldn't go Sunday we put Terry there,'' Tobin said.
``But we could also put Jamir there and play Patrick Sapp at
Jamir's outside spot if Maddox can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of McKinnon, plus that of defensive tackle Eric
Swann, who's still considering arthroscopic surgery next Monday
that would end his season, comes at a terrible time.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Cardinals weak up the middle against the Giants,
who have rushed for 581 yards against them in their past three
outings, while outscoring them by an average of 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants have moved the ball in recent years by running
it,'' Tobin said. ``We have not been able to score much on them and
have been playing from behind, which has allowed them to pound the
ball. ``It's a double-edged sword. The offense can take a lot of
pressure off the defense by scoring early and making them play a
more conventional game than they have had to. I think our defense
will step up and play well down the stretch. The guys who are
playing are just going to have to step up to the challenge if Swann
and McKinnon can't play.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Likes moves &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was pleased with the play of rookie cornerback Corey
Chavous and safety Kwamie Lassiter, each of whom made their first
starts against the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey played pretty good for his first time,'' Tobin said.
``He got beat a couple of times, but most cornerbacks do get beat
at times. He was also in good position a lot of the time and made
an excellent interception that gave us an opportunity to get back
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kwamie played quite well. He made a lot of tackles and was in
the right position most of the time and came up and filled the
alley really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavous' interception was the first by a Cardinals' cornerback
other than Aeneas Williams in 39 games. &QL;  &QL; 
First downs &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants planned to fly to Tucson after Monday night's game
against San Francisco, where they will practice before coming to
the Valley on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Adrian Murrell's 31-yard run against the Chiefs was
the team's longest in 31 games, since Lashon Johnson ran for 31
yards against the New York Jets on Oct. 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Giants-49ers game, Cardinals receiver Frank
Sanders led the NFC in receptions with 64, three more than the
49ers' Jerry Rice. &QL;  &QL;

TROJANS LET UP BUT WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's already obvious USC doesn't need any lessons
on winning basketball games, but putting a complete 40 minutes
together remains a sticky subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans put away St. Bonaventure 91-82 before 2,070 at the
Sports Arena on Monday but would have felt a lot better if the game
had been 34 minutes long instead of 40.
</P>
<P>
   USC (4-0) led 82-57 with six minutes remaining and seemed primed
for a casual end to their blowout victory. But after starters Brian
Scalabrine and Brandon Granville were taken out, the Bonnies took
advantage by outscoring the Trojans 25-9. The game was never in
doubt, but a satisfying victory suddenly became another growing
pain for the youthful Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blow a 25-point lead down to nine points,''
Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, USC continues to be off to its best start in
10 years and continues to draw Top 25-poll votes. But nobody was
really celebrating after the Trojans defeated the struggling
Bonnies (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were ready to play,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said. ``We got the victory. We got what we wanted. We didn't play
40 minutes. We didn't come out of the locker room ready to go like
I thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing the Trojans needed a shake-up and because
forward Jarvis Turner remains bothered by back spasms, Bibby gave
forward Greg Lakey his first start of the season. The move paid off
but for Turner more than Lakey. Turner came off the bench and
scored 16 points and grabbed six rebounds in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when people go to the bench they get frustrated. I
wanted to give the team a boost and some life,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the back spasms. Turner said he felt ``so-so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also received a lift off the bench from Adam
Spanich, who had 18 points and four 3-pointers. In addition,
Scalabrine was his usual self, with 15 points and eight rebounds,
and Granville had 14 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a pretty nice effort, if you erase those final six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a mental lapse the last five minutes,'' Turner
said. ``We stopped playing hard. We kind of got complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   The players claimed their letdown had nothing to do with St.
Bonaventure, another relatively unimpressive team on the schedule
before USC has to play Kansas on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually not in our nature to take teams lightly,''
Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Kevin Augustine had his best game of the season, since
returning to the team after being suspended during the preseason
for personal reasons. Augustine played 17 minutes and had seven
points and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back in shape,'' Augustine said. ``I definitely feel like
I am excited about the team again. I have the attitude that if I
get a minute, I just go in and play hard. I put myself in this
situation and this role and I'm accepting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans are rated 22nd in the latest Jeff Sagarin
power ratings.... It might be time for sophomore forward Shannon
Swillis to consider switching from small forward back to power
forward. He didn't play a second straight game and is sitting
behind Spanich and Jeff Trepagnier. Freshman forward Sam Clancy
played just two minutes.

ELLIOTT LEAVING WITH NO BITTERNESS  
 QB SAYS TRANSFER WAS ONLY OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-ELLIOTT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he called his release from the team a shock, Chad
Elliott said he intended to transfer anyway after realizing he
``would never be allowed to be on equal ground'' with starting
quarterback Ryan Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also said Monday he will not leave Arizona State with
hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The redshirt freshman did not accompany the Sun Devils to Tucson
on Thursday after being told by Coach Bruce Snyder that his
presence on the team would be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me in meetings and said, `What are your plans
for next year?' '' Elliott said. ``I told him, `I don't think I
have a future here and I don't think it would be in my best
interest to stay.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood that. He basically wished me the best of luck
and told me they weren't going to take me to the last game because
they didn't need any distractions going to UofA.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who received his official release from ASU on Monday,
said Ohio State and Tennessee are among the schools he is
considering. The Buckeyes have contacted ASU to seek permission to
talk to him, he said. The Volunteers are interested in him because
his best friend from high school, Dante Stallworth, is a receiver
there.
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott transfers to a Division I school, he will lose a
season of eligibility and would be required to sit out a year. He
does not intend to transfer to a Pac-10 schoolbecause that would
mean a loss of two seasons of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was a shock to me how they did it at the last
minute, I'm happy overall with the way they've handled it,''
Elliott said. ``Coach Snyder could have really been angry at me and
said, `We're going to try to hinder your progress of trying to go
somewhere and trying to be successful.' He didn't do anything like
that at all. He understood what I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he made the decision to release Elliott after his
recent body language suggested he wasn't focused on game
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes coaches, in trying to understand where a
player's coming from, will try to look for things that aren't
there,'' Elliott said. ``That's not how I felt at all. I practiced
hard. I was disappointed. I wanted to go to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he began to evaluate his future at ASU after
watching his role change. He went from third string, to starter
against Stanford, to being pulled in the third quarter and then
``back to third string.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he watched the Arizona game, which ASU lost, 50-42,
at a pizza parlor with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' he said. ``I felt I should have been out there
on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott called Kealy and backup quarterback Steve Campbell
``great guys. I'll be able to take a lot from them. They really
helped me in becoming a college quarterback. They know a lot of
things I didn't know. They were like coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he will complete the current semester at ASU and
then begin taking recruiting trips in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'm happy to leave, but in a way, I am
because I know I can go somewhere and get a fresh start, fresh
opportunity,'' he said. ``But there's no bitterness at all.''

YOUNGSTERS NOW PLAYING ROLE IN COYOTES SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young guns.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld made a point of mentioning it
nearly every day during training camp. If the Coyotes were to truly
take it to the next level this NHL season, their batch of young
players would have to step up and contribute in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the kids are all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, our first line of (Jeremy) Roenick, (Keith)
Tkachuk and (Dallas) Drake, along with Rick Tocchet, was carrying
the burden of the offensive production,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It's
difficult to maintain a good winning percentage when you only have
four or five players that are putting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last few games, we've been spreading it out. . . .
That's what you need over the course of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken awhile, but the Coyotes' 20-something crowd of
forwards Daniel Briere, Brad Isbister, Shane Doan and Juha Ylonen,
and defensemen Oleg Tverdovsky, Deron Quint and Bryan Helmer are
every bit as responsible for the team's eight-game winning streak
and club-record 14-game unbeaten streak as Tkachuk, Roenick and
Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Especially lately.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, 21, a rookie center, has chipped in two goals and two
assists, including a power-play tally Saturday in Los Angeles that
propelled first-place Phoenix (14-2-2) to a 4-0 victory and its
eighth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister, 21, a second-year right wing, snared two goals in a
three-game span. Doan, 22, a physical right wing in his fourth NHL
season, finally got off the scoreless sheet with two big assists
against the Kings. Ylonen, a second-year pro at age 26, has eight
assists and got his first goal Saturday in LA.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 22-year-old Tverdovsky and fellow blueliners
Quint, 22, and Helmer, 26, are taking care of business in the zone,
playing shipshape defense for a club that has set an NHL
post-expansion record by going 17 straight games of allowing only
two goals or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   And those three generally are labeled as ``offensive''
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have been doing the job and that's what we need,''
said Tkachuk, who with 12 goals through 18 games is on pace for his
third 50-goal season. ``Everybody is a big piece of this puzzle,
whether you're 35 or you're 25 or you're 19 or 20. It's big. The
younger guys are getting their opportunity to play, and they've got
to produce, and that's a big lift if guys like Jeremy, myself and
Dally get shut down. Same thing if it's Tocchet or `Gus' (Adams)
that gets shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need guys like these young guys, Danny, Izzy, Doaner and
Juha to step in, and that's what they're doing. That's depth.
That's what teams like the Detroit Red Wings have. You need guys
scoring goals on the third and fourth lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld has the Coyotes' young guns spread throughout the
lineup. Briere, for example, whose playmaking abilities and past
scoring exploits made former veteran Cliff Ronning expendable in a
trade last month to Nashville, is centering the No. 2 line between
Adams and Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Doan has been busy on a defensive-oriented third line, playing
with Ylonen and Bob Corkum in the middle. Isbister, who's been up
and down from the minor leagues, seems to have found a home on the
fourth line with center Mike Stapleton and left wing Mike Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all interchangeable, which Schoenfeld proved in
Saturday's shutout over the Kings and an impressive 3-2 victory
over New Jersey earlier. At different times, Briere subbed for
Roenick on the first line, Ylonen subbed for Briere on the second
line, and Briere hooked up with Isbister and Doan on a forward line
the Coyotes have taken to calling the ``Kid Line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Shane a lot last year in Springfield (in the
American Hockey League) and I played with Izzy at the World Juniors
two years ago, and we've all had success before,'' Briere said.
``We tried doing it in the preseason this year and it didn't work,
for whatever reason, but . . . we know it can.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times lately when the Kid Line has been on the
ice at the same time as Quint and Helmer, prompting some to
second-guess Schoenfeld's shift patterns. But it's hard to argue
with the results.
</P>
<P>
   It may change, but the kids know they're all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know who you're going to play with, but of course,
you'd love to play with Daniel and Izzy,'' Doan said. ``We're all
good friends and we get along great. But right now, we're all on
different lines and it doesn't matter because everyone is going
great.''

HERE'S THE PITCH  
 D-BACKS' PRICE HIKES BRING STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing general partner, has
a message for those who are irked over the team raising ticket
prices after its first season: Yes, the club is fixated with the
bottom line. But not the one beneath a column of dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thought we were a cash cow and we were putting money
in our pockets, that couldn't be any further from the truth,''
Colangelo said after the Diamondbacks signed pitcher Randy Johnson
to a four-year contract worth $52.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is run a business, put money into the
product. We're trying to build something people will be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in turn responded immediately. Dianne Aguilar, the club
vice president of ticket operations, said a surge in season ticket
inquiries began when the news about Johnson surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall a day where we've been this busy, that early
and throughout the day,'' Aguilar said late Monday before the final
numbers had been tallied.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices and sales and the financial implications of the
deal were not foremost on Colangelo's mind as he stood on the field
Monday at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears we can go out there every night and compete,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a businessman, Colangelo is aware of numbers besides
Johnson's ERA.
</P>
<P>
   About 67 percent of last year's season ticket holders have
renewed so far. Some of those who didn't are disenchanted with the
increase, but club officials say most did not want to commit to a
full schedule of 81 games. Now, with the addition of Johnson plus
four other free agents, sales are sure to climb. Colangelo said the
goal is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One fan who did renew his tickets said his faith in the
franchise has been restored. Joe McKenzie, a Phoenix accountant,
said he wasn't happy with the increase but was curious about what
the Diamondbacks would do in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see how quickly they were going to make the team
competitive,'' he said. ``I think they've made a pretty good first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Johnson, one of the game's premier pitchers, caps
an early Christmas season for the Diamondbacks. They shopped for
another quality starter, Todd Stottlemyre, plus pitchers Armando
Reynoso and Greg Swindell and first baseman-outfielder Greg
Colbrunn. The price tag for all five comes to about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appears the Diamondbacks' payroll took a huge
leap from last year's $32 million to $53 million so far. And
officially, it has. But through what Colangelo calls ``creative
structuring,'' a good portion of the salaries of Johnson,
Stottlemyre and third baseman Matt Williams have been deferred
until their retirements. Colangelo said that will reduce this
year's actual payroll to about $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   Club President Rich Dozer said the Diamondbacks broke even with
the cash last year, and that was after drawing more than 3.6
million fans. What about this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson in particular and a presumably better Diamondbacks
team that went 65-97 in 1998 might translate into added revenue.
Johnson was responsible for an additional 15,000 fans each time he
pitched in Houston last season. The Diamondbacks don't have room
for that kind of jump, but a full house when he takes the mound at
Bank One Ballpark is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   A better team also means better television ratings or even more
games on TV, which means more advertising, and it means more
souvenir sales, like those high-priced jerseys (look for lots of
Johnson's No. 51 popping up around town).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can quantify a pretty substantial return,'' Colangelo said.
``So it's not all negative cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   But mainly, Colangelo said the intent was to ``cut short
dramatically'' the time it takes to become competitive.

ROTATION BEST IN NL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some day, probably not too far off, the folks in the
Diamondbacks' front office will chuckle in amazement at the
difference between the club's starting rotation in its inaugural
season and the one taking the mound in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks believe they're assured of playing meaningful
games next September after they landed prized free agent Randy
Johnson on Monday with a four-year contract worth $52.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson agreed to become the ace of the fledgling
franchise's rotation, joining the starting pitchers already on
board, it gave the Diamondbacks what many observers say is the most
menacing staff in the National League outside the Atlanta city
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's arrival is expected to have a positive domino effect
on the rest of the rotation. Sliding Todd Stottlemyre and Andy
Benes back into the Nos. 2 and 3 slots will make them more
effective. And pushing back Omar Daal and Armando Reynoso into the
Nos. 4 and 5 positions gives the Diamondbacks the best rotation,
top to bottom, in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many clubs in the National League wouldn't want to have
that rotation?'' Florida General Manager Dave Dombrowski said.
``The elite No. 1 starters, there just aren't that many of those
guys. Everyone in baseball wants one.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA in 11 starts for Houston
after being traded by Seattle on July 31, showed he is still
capable of being the most dominant pitcher in the game when he sets
his mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of comments from some sage baseball people:
</P>
<P>
   Detroit GM Randy Smith: ``Whoo! That's a pretty impressive
rotation. It's a terrific staff. It's a staff you can consider that
of a contender. There's still some other questions, but you look at
the depth of the rotation and I think they're a threat. We've been
talking about their rotation here in the office for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella: ``That's a pretty formidable group
of starters. Randy's definitely got a lot left and he showed that
after he got to Houston. He competes. He's one of the top five guys
in baseball, no question. I'm happy for him because he's staying
home and that was important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego GM Kevin Towers: ``What a dominant No. 1 does, more
than anything, is allow everyone else in the rotation to relax a
little. Kevin Brown did that for us last season and we ended up in
the World Series. Have they improved themselves? Most definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees GM Brian Cashman: ``They now have a chance to win every
day. To be able to put a starter out there who gives your offense
that chance is immeasurable. I'm just glad Randy Johnson's in the
National League and we won't have to contend with him. It's a
championship rotation, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the rave reviews (which mean little since they're
coming in December), the Diamondbacks have more work to do before
they can become just the second expansion club to post a winning
season in its second season (the Angels did it when they went 86-76
in 1962).
</P>
<P>
   The ledger will show the club's payroll jumping to somewhere in
the mid-$50 million range. In upfront cash, though, $15 million
must be subtracted from that total, because Johnson, Stottlemyre,
Matt Williams and Bernard Gilkey are all taking deferred payments
for nearly half of their combined $32.5 million salaries next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will pay an additional $20 million or so to the
remaining players on their roster, giving them a projected payroll
somewhere near $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how to improve the offense, which scored
more runs than only Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh and Montreal last season.
With Brian Anderson suddenly expendable, the club is willing to
listen to offers for the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   What can Anderson bring the Diamondbacks? Cleveland's Richie
Sexson and Anaheim's Jim Edmonds are possibilities. In addition,
with starting pitching being so scarce these days, at least in most
other cities, you never know what some club may be willing to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll find out just how important pitching really is. &QL;

   House takes probe into fund-raising
</P>
<P>
   By Rebecca Carr
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998, Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Washington House Republicans are broadening the focus of the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton beyond his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky to include alleged campaign finance abuses,
requesting the chief investigators of that probe to appear before
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will vote today on whether to
issue five new subpoenas, including one addressed to the president,
one to Attorney General Janet Reno and one to FBI Director Louis
Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's subpoena does not ask him to appear before the panel,
but it does seek memos related to alleged Democratic campaign
fund-raising abuses during the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is interested in memos authored by Freeh, and by
Charles LaBella, a former Justice Department prosecutor who headed
the investigation into campaign fund-raising abuses. Freeh and
LaBella were the only two out of the five supoenaed who were
expected to appear before the committee. And that could happen this
week.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his cooperation in the panel's impeachment
investigation, independent counsel Kenneth Starr also will receive
a subpoena. Investigators want documents from Starr that relate to
John Huang, the former fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to expand the process came on the eve of the
Judiciary Committee's hearing into the consequences of lying under
oath. Today's witnesses will include Judge Gerald Tjoflat of the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. In 1994, Tjoflat
authored a strongly worded ruling upholding a perjury conviction in
a civil suit. Also appearing will be Pam Parsons of Atlanta, a
former University of South Carolina basketball coach convicted of
lying to hide an affair with a member of her team.
</P>
<P>
   In a search for new evidence of obstruction of justice by the
president, Republicans seek documents concerning several figures
from the campaign fund-raising scandal. The figures include
California businessman Johnny Chung, former Arkansas restaurateur
Charlie Trie and Mark Middleton, a former White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Dec. 31 deadline set by Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the expansion of the impeachment inquiry
caught many on Capitol Hill off guard. Republican investigators say
they do not need an extension of their inquiry because they know
exactly what they want: a series of memos written by LaBella and
Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee has information that indicates that the memos
may contain evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president,''
said Paul McNulty, senior spokesman for Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have tried to obtain the memos, but a
federal court told the Justice Department it had not shown
sufficient reason to hand over the full documents. They have
remained under seal because they contain grand jury information,
which must stay secret without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction at the White House was cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard these news reports about an expanded inquiry,
frankly, it seems very odd to us, but we will await the chairman's
explanation about what's going on before commenting further,'' said
Jim Kennedy, special counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing into crimes of perjury is an attempt to focus
the nation's attention on whether to remove Clinton from office for
allegedly lying under oath about his relationship with the former
White House intern and then obstructing justice and tampering with
witnesses to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important despite the political spinning from the White
House that perjury isn't important,'' said Georgia Republican Rep.
Bob Barr, a member of the Judiciary panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man needs to be impeached,'' Barr said. Congressional
failure to act would tell the American people that lying under oath
is a permissible act, and that is intolerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats viewed the hearing with skepticism, deriding it as
a ``desperate public relations attempt'' to salvage the impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committee Republicans long ago abandoned all pretenses of a
legitimate investigation and an honest inquiry into the standards
of impeachment,'' said Jim Jordan, the spokesman for the
committee's Democrats. ``Instead, they are lurching through a
series of increasingly trivial public relations stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is preparing to begin debate on articles of
impeachment as early as next week. In an attempt to streamline that
process, the committee has canceled plans to question Robert
Bennett, the president's lawyer in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican attempt to gain new information from Democratic
fund-raiser Nathan Landow failed Monday when he invoked his Fifth
Amendment right not to incriminate himself, declining to answer
questions about what he advised Kathleen Willey, a former White
House volunteer, to testify about her allegation that the president
made an unwanted sexual advance on her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war between the committee Republicans and the White
House intensified Monday with Hyde frustrated by the lack of
cooperation from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a tersely written statement, Hyde had ``reviewed with
dismay'' the president's responses to 81 statements of fact
submitted to him by the committee on Nov. 5. ``Instead of shedding
new light on the key facts, the president chose to evade them,''
Hyde said. ``He did not challenge the truthfulness of the evidence.
Rather his responses revealed a selective ability to recall
information.''

THIS is how it is. This is how it starts.
</P>
<P>
   When you're trying to lift a basketball program from one era to
the next, you do things like this. You do kid things. You do
learning-curve things.
</P>
<P>
   One day, you look like a basketball fraternity along the lines
of the Sig Oops.
</P>
<P>
   There are turnovers, missed shots and bad plays in what turns
out to be an ICU kind of game against some P.U. team called IUPUI
(or, if you have the time, Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis).
</P>
<P>
   And you can only say OK. This Cougars team has a long, long way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   But two days later, you're playing a team with much more
formidable initials. You're playing LSU, which has a real history,
plays in a real conference and enters with a 3-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly you look like you're on the way back to the
glorious days of Phi Slama Jama.
</P>
<P>
   You win impressively, 67-55, and everyone walks out of the joint
humming the fight song, dreaming about the future and marveling
about the Iceman's cool kid named Gee Gervin, who's so good he
brings his own exclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Drexler knows all this.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that for every up, there are liable to be a couple of
downs. For every forgettable night like the loss to Sam Houston
State or the struggle with IUPUI, there will be nights like Monday,
when maybe everything didn't go right but enough did.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the best thing Drexler did between the IUPUI game
and Monday night was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If Drexler is not careful, people are going to start calling him
``coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't rant over the sloppy effort against the P.U. team
Saturday night. He didn't snipe or bark about the mistakes. He
didn't even have practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have those fresh legs,'' Drexler said. ``I didn't
want to practice just to practice. Basically, we're a young team.
Tonight, I thought we showed the mark of a good team. This was how
we like to play. This was Cougars basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a night that didn't just offer evidence that the
Cougars could be on their way to a bright future. It offered some
hints that Drexler might be more serious about this coaching gig
than most experts and fans around the country believed he would be.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, aside from the decision to rest his players
before facing the burly Tigers, Drexler handled an off-court
distraction involving freshman guard Moses Malone Jr.
</P>
<P>
   There was a complaint about playing time. Drexler talked with
Malone and Malone's parents about it but then stood his ground with
the talented guard, who Drexler believes needs work with his
defense and court control. Obviously, he does. Malone played just
11 minutes Monday, missing all three shots he took.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler also outcoached LSU's John Brady on Monday. Period.
Drexler mixed in some timely half-court traps and matchup zones and
had hustling inside men Chad Hendrick and William Stringfellow
rough up LSU big men Brian Beshara and Cedric Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked before the game that setting the tone defensively
would win,'' Drexler said, obviously sounding like a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if the second half was a case of adjustments at the
break, the fresh legs or simply pure luck? But the Coogs cut down
on turnovers while improving their shooting percentage, stretching
a rebounding edge and tripling their first-half steals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the smartest move of all: giving the ball to the
cool kid. It was a coaching move only a former player could make:
``Son, be selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee Whiz was the biggest factor in this game's looking Slama
Jama-like, and never was he more of a factor than during UH's
decisive 15-3 run at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Gervin had 25 points on an array of twists and
turns. His pipe-cleaner arms swiped the ball from befuddled Tigers
at the most opportune times. His mostly expressionless face, like
his old man's, made Drexler look like a smart old coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have a guard who's always cool under fire,''
Drexler said of Gervin. ``We expect great things from a lot of
guys. These are the guys you're going to hear about.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is how it all starts.

JOHNSON WON DERS, `WHY NOT ARIZONA?' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Randy Johnson, easily the largest building block in
the foundation of the Diamondbacks' brief history, is ready for The
Question.
</P>
<P>
   The game's most dominating pitcher, who agreed to pitch for the
Diamondbacks for the next four years in exchange for more than $52
million, will be waiting for the inevitable when he is introduced
to the local media Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going want to know how I could be 9-10 with Seattle
and 10-1 with Houston last year,'' Johnson said from his Paradise
Valley home Monday night. ``I'll tell you exactly how I did it.
Because I was happy. It's a five-letter word. I was much happier in
Houston. I was happy with the environment I was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying in Seattle. If anyone's ever seen me on the
mound, I pitch with a lot of emotion. When you've got an employer
screwing with your head, it's kind of tough. Look at Wade Boggs and
Roger Clemens during their final years in Boston and look at what
they did after they left. I'm human. I'm no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began the 1998 season with the knowledge that Seattle
was not interested in having him back in 1999, even though in nine
seasons he had won 121 games, led the Mariners to the franchise's
only two playoff appearances, and captured a Cy Young Award
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's management publicly yanked Johnson on and off the
trading block a couple of times during the season. Johnson
eventually was sent to Houston in exchange for four prospects hours
before the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch better in Houston,'' Johnson said.
``Velocity-wise there was nothing different. I was enjoying what I
was doing. This coming year I'm going to be extremely happy. It's
pretty special to be part of a community you actually live in as
well. I'm excited about that. This is where my home is, it's where
I want my family to be and where I feel I can make the biggest
impact of the teams that wanted me to pitch for them. Plus, why not
Arizona?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will anchor what now must be considered one of the top
rotations in the National League, if not all of baseball. He will
be followed in the rotation by Todd Stottlemyre, Andy Benes, Omar
Daal and Armando Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the Atlanta Braves, no one has a rotation, front
and center, that can match Arizona's,'' Florida General Manager
Dave Dombrowski said. ``That's a championship rotation, no doubt
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, is aware of what will be expected from him.
Clearly, though, it's nothing he hasn't been prepared for in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go people expect me to win,'' Johnson said.
``It's like the playoff games; I pitched quality games, good enough
to win. But we ran into another pitcher who shut down our offense.
There are times you might lose a game where you pitched well. I
don't look at anything as pressure. I look at coming here as a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched for teams that were picked to go to the World
Series and didn't. Our Houston team was supposed to go and we
didn't get out of the first round of the playoffs. The same thing
for our '97 Mariners team. It's discouraging. But there are no
guarantees in baseball. Just like there's no guarantee we're not
going to go the World Series or win the division this coming
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turned down virtually identical offers from
Anaheim, Texas and Los Angeles, is cautious enough to realize the
Diamondbacks' chances of reaching the postseason in the coming year
remain remote. Nonetheless, he defended his decision to pitch for a
fledgling club over the more established ones he spurned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, the other teams might have better chance of
winning next year,'' Johnson said. ``But in the next four years I
think we will be competitive and go to playoffs. The City of
Phoenix will have an opportunity to watch this team grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, with all the new chemistry, it's going to take a
while for everyone to play together. By 2000, I assume we'll be
competing for a wild card at worst. At best, in 2001 and 2002 I
would say we'll be competing for an NL West title, if not sooner.
This year could be a magical and exciting year. It's not that bad
of a team. It had some holes that hopefully have been filled.'' &QL;

SEPARATIST PREMIER KEEPS CONTROL IN QUEBEC'S PROVINCIAL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti
Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province,
possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest
of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday
night, the separatist party had 42.8 percent of the vote, compared
with 43.6 percent for the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and
12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action. The separatists
were expected to win 77 of the provincial assembly's 125 seats, the
Liberals 46 and Democratic Action 1, with one seat unfilled because
of a death during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected
defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on
whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an
end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to
separate.
</P>
<P>
   With results still trickling in, the separatists were projected
to take roughly the same number of districts in the provincial
assembly as in 1994, with roughly the same percentage of the
overall vote as in the last election. Bouchard had been counting on
a gain of several seats to solidify his support.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists fell short of the 46 percent they had said they
needed to succeed in a third referendum to take Quebec out of
Canada and form an independent nation of roughly seven million
people on the northern border of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists have lost two previous referendums, one
decisively in 1980, the other narrowly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's support is strongest among French-speaking voters,
who are more evenly spread throughout the province than English
speakers, who are concentrated in and around the city of Montreal
and who traditionally vote for the Liberals and against separation.
It was the third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, who seemed to have
drawn votes from the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold
another referendum in the four to five years of his government if
``winning conditions'' existed. While he never defined those
conditions, it was widely believed that one of them was a level of
popular support above 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for
separation has declined. Recent polls indicate that only 43 percent
of Quebecers would vote yes in another referendum on independence,
a drop of four percentage points during the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past few weeks, I have had the feeling that were it
not for the issue of sovereignty, a greater number of English
speaking Quebeckers would have supported our program,'' Bouchard
said in a restrained victory speech before supporters here in
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned sovereighnty only once, repeating his pledge to
create the ``winning conditions'' under which a referendum could be
won. But he also acknowledged that the lower than expected level of
support for his party reflected a disastisfaction among voters that
he could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the signal you sent by choosing candidates who
reflect their attachnment to Canada,'' he said. ``We have decided
to stay the course no matter what political decisions the people of
Quebec make for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be taking place, analysts said, is that
Quebecers see this election as a vote on government, not on
independence, so separatist emotions are in check. But voters want
Bouchard to keep alive the possibility of another referendum on
separation as a way of increasing the province's leverage with
Ottawa in upcoming discussions about changes in the shape of
Canadian federalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a referendum, Bouchard's re-election would increase
tensions and uncertainty in Canada. During the campaign, he said he
would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation,
forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not
just to Quebec but to all 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke, he silenced the critics in his own party who
suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central
government, and he undercut the position of Charest, who equated a
vote for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want, and Quebecers don't want, to be divided during
the next four years,'' Charest said in a concession speech in his
home district of Sherbrooke, where he narrowly regained his seat in
the provincial assembly. He said he would not resign, but would
fight as leader of the opposition to bring Quebec together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want
this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government
it has,'' Charest said.
</P>
<P>
   When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge
Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little
chance of retaining power. Many in English Canada believed that if
Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a
moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could
end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has
been diluted by immigration and demographic change.
</P>
<P>
   But Charest's campaign never caught on. It is expected that
there will now be calls for his resignation, and that of Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who is against changes to the Canadian
federation.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Charest to win support in his home province was
just one surprise among many in this election that seemed to settle
very little except Bouchard's reputation as one of Quebec's most
popular and adept political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the strangest election I have ever seen in my
life,'' said Pierre Roy, 61, a retired businessman from Lac
Beauport, near Quebec city. ``Bouchard's posters said `Have
confidence,' but people are afraid about what's going to happen.''
Roy voted just after polls opened at 10 a.m. on a gray day marked
with freezing rain and snow in many parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
   While Quebec's future is still uncertain, the outcome of the
election was predicted by public opinion polls weeks ago. Unlike
past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial
markets spiraling downward, the projected results appeared to have
been discounted already.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar actually strengthened slightly , closing at
a value of 65 U.S. cents. The Toronto Stock Exchange declined just
under 2 percent on a day when most markets around the world were
also down for reasons that had nothing to do with the election
here.
</P>
<P>
   The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is
based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated
fairly by English speaking Canada. Most popular among young voters,
the movement seeks to preserve and strengthen Quebecois culture.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical wing of the party pushes for outright
independence, but more moderate members say they want to negotiate
something less than a separate nation, perhaps an economic
relationship with the rest of Canada that allows them to keep their
Canadian passports and their Canadian currency but have control
over language, culture and many other social considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists have often tried to portray the process of secession
as straightforward and relatively painless. But that does not take
into account such issues as dividing the national debt,
compensation for federal property and Quebec's place in
international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Canada would not vote in a referendum, but would
have to negotiate the terms of secession, a difficult process at
best. In addition, the Cree Indians who live in northern Quebec and
roughly 700,000 English speakers in the Montreal area who want to
stay in Canada would be likely to insist on the partition of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-day election campaign _ the shortest in Quebec history _
was marked by a frantic pace of speeches and rallies, and one
debate on Nov. 17 that was seen by many viewers as a virtual tie
between Bouchard and Charest. Dumont, of the Democratic Action
Party, also appeared in the debate, and his strong performance was
believed to have hurt Charest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the campaign generated little real emotion, despite
expectations that it would be a clash of titans. However, the
results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction
between Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to
holding a third referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through
another referendum, but that they believe the threat of separation
is useful to bringing about changes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no people yelling slogans in the street or things
like that,'' said Gilles Paquet, director of the Center on
Governance at the University of Ottawa. ``Instead, what you saw
today is the rational vote by a group that feels it can do better
in the Canadian federation by electing a separatist government.''
</P>
<P>
   What appears certain is that the results of Monday's election
will set all of Canada on another painful round of introspection
and soul-searching about the identity and nature of the country.
</P>
<P>
   This period could be different, however, because Bouchard _ an
experienced negotiator _ has introduced a new element that
substantially changes the picture. In one of the many major shifts
in the positions that he took during the campaign, he hinted that
before calling a referendum on independence, he would push Ottawa
for a freer hand in spending on social issues, especially health.
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's national medical system, delivering health care
is the responsibility of each of the 10 provinces. But the federal
government provides about 70 percent of the money that the
provinces spend on health care and imposes many standards and
restrictions on how the money can be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard and the premiers of the other nine provinces signed an
agreement at a meeting last summer to explore a new arrangement
that would give the provinces more flexibility, including the
chance to get money from Ottawa without participating in the
federal system.
</P>
<P>
   For Bouchard, it appears to be a strategy that cannot lose. If
Ottawa gives in to the demands, Bouchard can tell the people of
Quebec that he wrested an important concession from Prime Minister
Chretien, who has strongly opposed giving any more powers to the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   If Ottawa refuses, Bouchard can say that he had tried to
negotiate in good faith but was rejected. That could represent one
of the ``winning conditions'' that he said must be apparent before
he calls for another referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   What is uncertain, analysts say, is how much resentment would be
generated by Ottawa's rebuff of the new federalism, and how that
resentment would affect a vote on separation.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bouchard signed the agreement with the other premiers last
summer, little attention has been paid to the issue in Quebec. But
polls indicate that a majority of Quebecers want Bouchard to
negotiate a new federal union.
</P>
<P>
   By imposing the requirement of ``winning conditions'' on another
referendum, and by raising the question of negotiating changes in
Canadian federalism with Ottawa, Bouchard has left himself so many
options that there is no way to know his exact plans.

KITNA SPARK PROVIDES A GLOW IN PREPARATION FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ When Dennis Erickson decided to bench Warren
Moon last week, the Seahawks coach was hoping Jon Kitna could
provide a spark for the struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   What Erickson didn't know is how Kitna's presence at quarterback
would influence the other players.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's stunning, last-second victory over the Tennessee
Oilers, Kitna provided a spark that ignited even more than Erickson
could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, overall, that's as well as we've played all
year,'' Erickson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers support Erickson's assessment. The Seahawks produced
a season-high 296 passing yards, and the offense had its best
totals since the season-opening romp over the Philadelphia Eagles
in points scored (20), total yards (378) and third-down conversion
percentage (.420).
</P>
<P>
   The coaches altered the game plan a bit, using more
three-receiver, two-back alignments and going with quicker, shorter
passes. But it was more what the players did, than the formations
they did it from.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the other players elevated their play around
Jon,'' offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``People played
better than they've been playing and the unit played better than it
has been playing as a group. We didn't do a whole lot different. We
ran basically the same plays. We just executed them better than we
had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those who elevated their performances were the
almost-forgotten James McKnight, who caught five passes for a
career-high 113 yards, and the often under-used Ricky Watters, who
caught seven passes for 63 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per carry
in rushing for another 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``That offense we got from James McKnight was what we were
getting from him last year and what we were expecting to get from
him all of this year,'' Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna got production from the drop-prone McKnight by going to
him, even in clutch situations. Kitna also got Watters more
involved and let the emotional running back know he should expect
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon was looking for me,'' Watters said. ``He was telling me
before the game, `I'm going to look for you.' So I felt good about
it. It makes you want to get out there and get open because you
know he's going to get you the ball if you're open.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kitna-provided spark spreading to other players on
offense, Erickson said, ``Sometimes that's what a spark is. People
pick up their games because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   One good start deserves another, and Kitna will have to be even
better in this week's game against the 8-4 New York Jets at the
Meadowlands. The Jets' defense ranks fourth in the NFL, 18 spots
ahead of the Oilers, and has held four opponents to nine or fewer
points, including a 24-3 romp over the Oilers two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said Kitna will remain the starter for the remaining
four games, barring injury or a total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I'm concerned about is Jon improving this
week. He's going to have to play really well this week in New
York,'' Erickson said. ``The bottom line is consistency over a
period of time. It's not just one game.''

<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Cal State Northridge wanted to work on its
press and the dividends were so good it was pulled off by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors wanted strong half-court defense, and it worked so
well nary a Southern California College shot went in during the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, whatever the Matadors worked on worked. So well even
coach Bobby Braswell had to think of something to say after CSUN
routed Southern California College 92-50 Monday at home for its
second straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think about this,'' Braswell said. ``This is a
difficult game for us from the beginning. Any time you're coaching
a game like this you're always concerned about the guys coming in
and not being focused. They were focused and did what they were
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the game had merit in the Matadors' mind, and not just
because former UCLA standout Cameron Dollar coaches the Vanguards.
</P>
<P>
   It was scheduled at this juncture of the season in case CSUN
(3-2) needed a feel-good session before cruising the Pacific Ocean
to the University of Hawaii for a tournament which begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaii selected us to play in the first round, so it shows you
what they think of us,'' Braswell said. ``We told our guys in the
locker room they need to start thinking like champions. They need
to start thinking like they belong and not have a second-class
mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach you want to get your team to a certain level and
you want to get your guys thinking that they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   And against the Vanguards, clouded issues cleared a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Carr (10 points, six assists, one turnover) continued to
put distance between him and Jason Crowe for the starting point
guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Minor continued his sharp shooting, making 6 of 10 from
3-point range for a game-high 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave everybody a chance to work on things,'' said Minor,
who is 16 of 32 from 3-point range. ``When I was young all I would
do was shake-and-bake and drive to the basket so my dad told me to
shoot the ball from the outside. That's when I learned to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And much was also learned about CSUN's heralded forward Rico
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   He's a much better player when he gets involved in the offense
early. Albeit against inferior competition, Harris scored six
points early and finished with 17 points. He also grabbed 12
rebounds and didn't commit a turnover in posting the first
double-double by a Matador this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly do feel I'm better when I get into the flow early,''
Harris said. ``That's not for me to decide, though. It's for team
members to recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   But what this game did was set up the next two weekends for
CSUN, which carries much relevance in the college basketball
mid-major world. Since moving to Division I before the 1990-91
season, the Matadors haven't won an in-season tournament. During
the next 12 days they'll get that opportunity twice.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawaii tournament, CSUN plays in Brigham Young's
tournament Dec. 11-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just more momentum going into Hawaii,'' Harris said.
``Now that we're on a winning streak we can go to Hawaii and prove
we can play hard and we could win the first tournament in (Division
I) school history.'' &QL;

JOHNSON TO ARIZONA? M'S NOT SURPRISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The parting of company between the Mariners and Randy
Johnson is complete now. Johnson is the sweepstakes winner. He got
exactly what he wanted _ and wanted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Johnson signed a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He
is as rich as his pitching prowess will allow. Maybe Johnson, with
$52.4 million guaranteed, is richer than even he once imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, however, are still licking their wounds on this
public relations nightmare, though maybe it is time for the M's to
try to fix this, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's contract with the Diamondbacks is a fairly humorous
development for a man who insisted he did not care about the money,
only about being wanted and a chance to contend for a World Series.
Now Johnson is one of the $13 million men.
</P>
<P>
   It was only about 18 months ago that $11 million was top dollar
for such an unusual commodity as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't $11 million sound like it's about $2 million below
market for salaries now?'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, asked
from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It was Meister's way of saying the M's should not have balked at
paying Johnson ``Greg Maddux money'' back when the M's allegedly
still had a chance to sign Johnson. Call them parting words from
Meister.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's, too, had a parting shot for their former ace and
his people. Monday, Mariner president Chuck Armstrong decided to
take a few swipes at Johnson and his agents. The M's contend
Johnson's representatives had as much to do with Johnson no longer
being a Mariner as anything the Mariners did or did not do during
Johnson's tumultuous last 2{ seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson signed with the Diamondbacks. That's no surprise
to the Mariners,'' Armstrong said, deciding it was time to put a
spin on the Mariners' side of this contentious divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce was not only contentious, it became an industry
embarrassment. No one inside baseball (or outside among fans) could
understand how the most dominant left-handed pitcher in the game
could be allowed to stroll to Houston at the trading deadline for
three Astros minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners are convinced that the egg on their face is not
totally deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to August of 1997, when this whole thing started to
go downhill, that is what we were told by Randy's agents: Randy
Johnson wants to play for Arizona,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   According the Armstrong, he and Lee Pelekoudas, vice president
of baseball administration, were ``summoned'' to Chicago in '97 to
meet with Johnson's agents, Meister and Alan Nero. It was during
this meeting that Armstrong was presented with what he calls ``The
Nero Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us not to exercise Randy's option (for $6 million
for the 1998 season), and if we did, then trade him to Arizona in
the offseason,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   What Nero then suggested, Armstrong said, is that the
Diamondbacks would make available a list of players the M's might
find suitable as compensation for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he told Nero, ``I'm not sure this is legal and
it's sure not ethical.'' The Mariners will not discuss whether they
looked for evidence that Arizona owner Jerry Colangelo tampered
with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   However, after that fateful August meeting in Chicago, it was
clear to Armstrong that there would be no good-faith negotiating
with Johnson's representatives for an extended contract to keep the
Big Unit a Mariner forever.
</P>
<P>
   The parting of ways began in earnest that day, although it took
Johnson a brief stint in Houston and Monday's new deal with Arizona
to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is the Mariners who must continue to search for a
way to restore a ton of lost credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson deal is only part of a string of under-explained
events that have people wondering just what the M's are up to, from
stadium politics to trading away too many players to no single
owner willing to become a club spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Johnson boondoggle was significant. If the prolonged
trauma has not diminished the public's belief that the Mariners are
sincerely trying to field a contender, then why was the signing of
closer Jose Mesa last month treated with such overwhelming
skepticism?
</P>
<P>
   Is Mesa really much worse than Mike Timlin, who never came
through in a game that meant something to the Mariners but who
``flourished'' when the M's were out of contention in the second
half of '98?
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks of Johnson's fall from grace have been
reverberating up until now. Now, though, the M's appear willing to
make public the details of a big deal gone sour. According to them,
Randy Johnson has now gotten everything (and more) that he and his
people once demanded of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but the Mariners still need an ace. They still need
to figure out how they can contend on a middle-class payroll
budget. They still need to sign Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez
to extensions sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, they still need to demonstrate they can
wade through the muck and mire and still come out smelling like a
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Like Randy Johnson.

   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Cal State Northridge insiders said former
University of Miami athletic director Sam Jankovich could be named
CSUN's acting athletic director as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what everyone's saying around the school,'' said one
insider, requesting anonymity. ``It's what everyone is expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich couldn't be reached at his home for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have any comment on that,'' CSUN spokesman
John Chandler said. ``Stay tuned. We'll have an answer on that
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, who is retired, and CSUN President Blenda Wilson have
discussed such a move in the past. Jankovich, who hired Jimmy
Johnson at Miami and was a major fund-raiser at the school, has
been doing consulting work for Miami. He left Miami in 1990 to
become the chief executive officer for the New England Patriots
until January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has been without an athletic director since Paul Bubb's
resignation took effect Nov. 6. Men's basketball coach Bobby
Braswell has served as administrator-in-charge of the athletic
department since then. &QL;

49ERS DEFEAT GIANTS, 31-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the New York Giants, it began with a bomb,
but it ended as just another dud.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense momentarily shed its staid, sober image on
Monday night against the San Francisco 49ers. Quarterback Kent
Graham approached Coach Jim Fassel before the game and said,
``Let's throw that baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel looked across the rain-soaked field at 3Com Park and
decided to throw caution to the wind _ and a pass into it. On the
Giants' first play from scrimmage, Graham connected with wide
receiver Ike Hilliard for a startling 48-yard pass play that led to
the first Giants touchdown in San Francisco in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   It left Giants players celebrating and dreaming big.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were not as impressed. With a cool efficiency, they
slowly rallied, scoring in every quarter and shutting out the
Giants for the remainder of the game in an entertaining 31-7
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' march to the playoffs continues, although they did
lose defensive tackle Bryant Young, who collided with his teammate
Ken Norton in the fourth quarter and sustained a gruesome injury _
a broken right leg.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Giants, remarkably, they could have been one game out
of the chase for the last wild-card spot in the National Football
Conference with a victory. And they are playing the team they are
pursuing, the Arizona Cardinals, next weekend. Their scant playoff
hopes dissolved further as their record fell to 4-8.
</P>
<P>
   The talent levels of these two teams was obvious, especially in
the fourth quarter. It was then that the San Francisco defense
thwarted every Giants drive and the 49ers offense wore down a
fatigued Giants defense.
</P>
<P>
   But even in victory, the mood at 3Com Park was somber as 49ers
players talked about the lineman Young and the effect of his
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a truly respected leader on this team,'' quarterback
Steve Young said. ``On defense, he is the man _ the guy they all
look up to. It's not an injury we'll overcome easily. But we'll
have to do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the fourth quarter, the helmet of Norton struck
the defensive tackle's right leg at the end of a run by Graham.
Television replays showed defender's lower leg bending unnaturally
backward as Norton made his tackle attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him because I was spinning around, but I heard
his leg crack,'' Graham said. ``I looked down and saw he was
hurting big time. It was like he had another joint in his shin. It
was a Joe Theismann-type injury. You could see how devastating it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham finished the game with 237 passing yards, completing 21
of 41 passes with one interception. After the game, Fassel said he
planned to start Graham against Arizona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Kent made some really nice throws tonight,'' Fassel
said. ``He did enough things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was especially effective throwing to Hilliard, who had 6
catches for 141 yards.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants were competitive for most of the game with the
49ers, the game was decided in the third quarter when the 49ers
slipped away from the Giants, scoring a pivotal touchdown after the
teams traded punts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got the worst of that exchange _ a poor Giants punt,
poor Giants coverage and a needless penalty giving the 49ers superb
field position for their scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the game by 14-7, the 49ers began their possession at
the Giants' 37-yard line. Less than three minutes later, Terry
Kirby scored on a 7-yard run, bulling over strongside linebacker
Marcus Buckley at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 21-7, the Giants mounted a charge downfield with the
help of a 50-yard pass from Graham to Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Giants were faced with a fourth-and-3 at the San
Francisco 25-yard line, Fassel decided to have his team attempt a
43-yard field goal even though it would still leave the Giants
behind by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to play it safe looked that much worse when Brad
Daluiso, who strained his hamstring on the opening kickoff, missed
the attempt left of the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' hopes of an upset disappeared with that miss.
</P>
<P>
   If that was a Giants' low point, then the Giants' first drive
was the team's high point of the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Graham faked a handoff to fullback Charles
Way, then immediately lofted the ball toward Hilliard, who had
gotten several steps behind San Francisco's Tim McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard made the catch, though he fell down before he could
advance the ball farther. It was a 48-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   In previous games, Hilliard's stumble might have come back to
haunt the Giants since their offense has routinely squandered
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But in this first possession, the Giants could do no wrong. On
first down from the 49ers' 32-yard line, Gary Brown ran for 9 yards
around end.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, a huge hole opened for Way on a trap play to
the left side of the Giants' line. Way picked up 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And on the next play, Brown burst through a gaping hole in the
middle of the line and toppled into the 49ers' end zone. The last
Giants touchdown in a game played at 3Com Park, formerly known as
Candlestick Park, was a touchdown pass to Odessa Turner during a
34-24 San Francisco victory over the Giants in 1989. Monday night's
game is the fifth between the teams since that game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants were surprisingly spirited and efficient in
their first drive and most of their first-quarter play, for most of
the same quarter the 49ers seemed out of sync in all phases of
their game.
</P>
<P>
   But on a second-and-10 late in the first quarter, Young took one
step off the line of scrimmage and threw to his left, where Terrell
Owens was waiting. Hamilton, the Giants cornerback, threw himself
at Owens's feet. If Hamilton had made the tackle, it would have
been a 2-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   But Owens stepped over Hamilton's inexpert attempt, as he did
safety Sam Garnes's similar attempt a few yards farther downfield,
and then sprinted up the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown that tied
the score.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' final possession of the half, Young orchestrated a
brilliant 13-play, 90-yard touchdown drive. The key play came on a
third-and-3 at the Giants' 10-yard line when Young ran for 9 of his
62 rushing yards in the game.
</P>
<P>
   A one-yard touchdown pass from Young to Irv Smith, who was
uncovered in the Giants' end zone, followed on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison Hearst, who had 166 yards on 20 carries, added a
70-yard touchdown run late in the game. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The London theater world loves Hollywood, especially
the revenues it promises. Monday, Nicole Kidman earned a special
prize from The Evening Standard Theater Awards for her role in the
Donmar Warehouse's ``Blue Room,'' now in previews on Broadway at
the Cort Theater for a Dec. 13 opening. Seeing a film star onstage
``focuses the attention of an audience who might otherwise never
give a thought to theater from one year to the next,'' the judges
said. The Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey earned the
best-actor award for his acclaimed work in Eugene O'Neill's
``Iceman Cometh'' at the Almeida Theater. Other winners included
Sinead Cusack for best actress in ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' Michael
Frayn's ``Copenhagen'' for best play, and Trevor Nunn's revival of
``Oklahoma!'' for best musical.

   Ten years ago, the art world responded to the AIDS crisis in
general _ and specifically, the loss of its own _ by creating a Day
With(Out) Art. Tuesday the New York Public Library, the Museum of
Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum are among the institutions paying tribute to
those whose voices were silenced. In honor of the 10th anniversary
of the event, Patience and Fortitude, the lions guarding the main
entrance of the library at 42d Street and Fifth Avenue, will don
the red ribbons that signify AIDS awareness. At 7:45 p.m., the
city's floodlit buildings and bridges will turn off their lights
for 15 minutes in memory of all those who have died from
AIDS-related illnesses. Information: (212) 627-9855.

GIANTS' OFFENSE NEEDS A LEADER LIKE RICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice has
always been a player who wants to be the first option. As he grows
older, his skills no longer what they used to be, Rice watches
teammates like Terrell Owens, J.J. Stokes and Garrison Hearst get
the balls and the publicity. It infuriates him, and he speaks out
as he did last week, saying the team needs to throw the ball his
way more.
</P>
<P>
   He's Jerry Rice. He can do these things.
</P>
<P>
   While Rice was blasted as being selfish by people outside the
team, most of his teammates didn't blink. They know him. They know
he simply feels he can contribute and wants to do his share. And
that's what makes him a Hall of Famer _ Rice wants the ball, and he
will do whatever it takes to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants, who lost on Monday night to the 49ers,
31-7, could learn a few things from him.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Giants' offense _ of course, there are more
problems than there were raindrops soaking the 3Com Park turf on
Monday night _ is a lack of leadership. When you watch other
National Football League teams, there is always at least one player
on offense the team centers on. The good teams have more than one,
and the great teams have one at almost every position.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has Cris Carter. Green Bay has Brett Favre. Atlanta
has Jamal Anderson. Pittsburgh has Jerome Bettis. And the players
don't have to be great. You could easily argue that the entire
offensive line of the Denver Broncos, most of whose members, if
they walked into a supermarket, would go unnoticed (except for the
$500 bags of groceries), is the leader of that entire 12-0 team.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their defense, which has leaders like lineman Michael
Strahan and linebacker Jessie Armstead, the Giants have no such
players on offense. Fullback Charles Way is the closest thing. But
he's such a classy guy, he would never say anything publicly
controversial, and sometimes that's what it takes. There is no one
on the Giants' offense who will stand at his locker and say Coach
Jim Fassel needs to open things up. Or if wide receiver Joe
Jurevicius burns defensive backs like toast in practice, publicly
ask why he isn't playing more in games.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, it was Strahan and Armstead who went into
an offensive meeting and berated the players. Why couldn't someone
on offense do that?
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Bettis went to his offensive coordinator and
told him he wanted more carries. When the meeting became public,
Bettis didn't try to play it down or lie and say it didn't happen.
After the meeting, his carries increased.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Giants don't have players on offense who
have been to Pro Bowls or have three Super Bowl rings. But they do
have veterans with clout, like tight end Howard Cross and wide
receiver Chris Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a million miles between Carter and the
Vikings and the Giants. But it's not always about talent. Sometimes
it's attitude, and maybe all it will take is one player to state
the obvious: open up the offense, Jim. Just throw the darn ball.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Rice's complaints is that he has been productive
this year. Coming into the Giants game, he had a team-high 61
catches, which would have led the Giants for the season in 61 of
their last 66 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's personnel, and it is philosophy. The Giants' offense
doesn't have the guns and is a few years away from truly competing
with the elite teams. But Fassel, a smart coach, needs to get back
to what got him hired. He has got away from being creative and
taking chances. On the Giants' opening series Monday night, he had
Kent Graham throw deep, and the strong-armed quarterback found wide
receiver Ike Hilliard, who is going to be a good player, for 48
yards. Three plays later, running back Gary Brown ran for an
11-yard score. That was good play-calling by Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Giants fell behind, 14-7, at the half, and the offense
went into a shell. The third quarter wasn't the time to get shy.
Graham has one of the league's strongest arms _ use it. What's to
lose? The Giants are out of the playoff race, and the 49ers have
one of the league's worst pass defenses.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, it seemed as if Graham got tired of the restraints
and decided to improvise. Late in the third quarter, Graham rolled
out and, spotting Hilliard, launched a deep ball. Hilliard was
covered, but he sidestepped Darnell Walker and scooped in a 50-yard
catch. If Graham didn't take the chance, the play would never have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pretty moment in an ugly season. And no, Rice was not
on the Giants' sideline, telling them to throw the ball to
Hilliard. &QL;

JOHNSON TO ARIZONA? M'S NOT SURPRISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The parting of company between the Mariners and Randy
Johnson is complete now. Johnson is the sweepstakes winner. He got
exactly what he wanted _ and wanted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Johnson signed a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He
is as rich as his pitching prowess will allow. Maybe Johnson, with
$52.4 million guaranteed, is richer than even he once imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, however, are still licking their wounds on this
public relations nightmare, though maybe it is time for the M's to
try to fix this, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's contract with the Diamondbacks is a fairly humorous
development for a man who insisted he did not care about the money,
only about being wanted and a chance to contend for a World Series.
Now Johnson is one of the $13 million men.
</P>
<P>
   It was only about 18 months ago that $11 million was top dollar
for such an unusual commodity as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't $11 million sound like it's about $2 million below
market for salaries now?'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, asked
from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It was Meister's way of saying the M's should not have balked at
paying Johnson ``Greg Maddux money'' back when the M's allegedly
still had a chance to sign Johnson. Call them parting words from
Meister.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's, too, had a parting shot for their former ace and
his people. Monday, Mariner president Chuck Armstrong decided to
take a few swipes at Johnson and his agents. The M's contend
Johnson's representatives had as much to do with Johnson no longer
being a Mariner as anything the Mariners did or did not do during
Johnson's tumultuous last 2{ seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson signed with the Diamondbacks. That's no surprise
to the Mariners,'' Armstrong said, deciding it was time to put a
spin on the Mariners' side of this contentious divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce was not only contentious, it became an industry
embarrassment. No one inside baseball (or outside among fans) could
understand how the most dominant left-handed pitcher in the game
could be allowed to stroll to Houston at the trading deadline for
three Astros minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners are convinced that the egg on their face is not
totally deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to August of 1997, when this whole thing started to
go downhill, that is what we were told by Randy's agents: Randy
Johnson wants to play for Arizona,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   According the Armstrong, he and Lee Pelekoudas, vice president
of baseball administration, were ``summoned'' to Chicago in '97 to
meet with Johnson's agents, Meister and Alan Nero. It was during
this meeting that Armstrong was presented with what he calls ``The
Nero Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us not to exercise Randy's option (for $6 million
for the 1998 season), and if we did, then trade him to Arizona in
the offseason,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   What Nero then suggested, Armstrong said, is that the
Diamondbacks would make available a list of players the M's might
find suitable as compensation for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he told Nero, ``I'm not sure this is legal and
it's sure not ethical.'' The Mariners will not discuss whether they
looked for evidence that Arizona owner Jerry Colangelo tampered
with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   However, after that fateful August meeting in Chicago, it was
clear to Armstrong that there would be no good-faith negotiating
with Johnson's representatives for an extended contract to keep the
Big Unit a Mariner forever.
</P>
<P>
   The parting of ways began in earnest that day, although it took
Johnson a brief stint in Houston and Monday's new deal with Arizona
to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is the Mariners who must continue to search for a
way to restore a ton of lost credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson deal is only part of a string of under-explained
events that have people wondering just what the M's are up to, from
stadium politics to trading away too many players to no single
owner willing to become a club spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Johnson boondoggle was significant. If the prolonged
trauma has not diminished the public's belief that the Mariners are
sincerely trying to field a contender, then why was the signing of
closer Jose Mesa last month treated with such overwhelming
skepticism?
</P>
<P>
   Is Mesa really much worse than Mike Timlin, who never came
through in a game that meant something to the Mariners but who
``flourished'' when the M's were out of contention in the second
half of '98?
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks of Johnson's fall from grace have been
reverberating up until now. Now, though, the M's appear willing to
make public the details of a big deal gone sour. According to them,
Randy Johnson has now gotten everything (and more) that he and his
people once demanded of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but the Mariners still need an ace. They still need
to figure out how they can contend on a middle-class payroll
budget. They still need to sign Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez
to extensions sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, they still need to demonstrate they can
wade through the muck and mire and still come out smelling like a
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Like Randy Johnson.

KITNA SPARK PROVIDES A GLOW IN PREPARATION FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ When Dennis Erickson decided to bench Warren
Moon last week, the Seahawks coach was hoping Jon Kitna could
provide a spark for the struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   What Erickson didn't know is how Kitna's presence at quarterback
would influence the other players.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's stunning, last-second victory over the Tennessee
Oilers, Kitna provided a spark that ignited even more than Erickson
could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, overall, that's as well as we've played all
year,'' Erickson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers support Erickson's assessment. The Seahawks produced
a season-high 296 passing yards, and the offense had its best
totals since the season-opening romp over the Philadelphia Eagles
in points scored (20), total yards (378) and third-down conversion
percentage (.420).
</P>
<P>
   The coaches altered the game plan a bit, using more
three-receiver, two-back alignments and going with quicker, shorter
passes. But it was more what the players did, than the formations
they did it from.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the other players elevated their play around
Jon,'' offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``People played
better than they've been playing and the unit played better than it
has been playing as a group. We didn't do a whole lot different. We
ran basically the same plays. We just executed them better than we
had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those who elevated their performances were the
almost-forgotten James McKnight, who caught five passes for a
career-high 113 yards, and the often under-used Ricky Watters, who
caught seven passes for 63 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per carry
in rushing for another 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``That offense we got from James McKnight was what we were
getting from him last year and what we were expecting to get from
him all of this year,'' Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna got production from the drop-prone McKnight by going to
him, even in clutch situations. Kitna also got Watters more
involved and let the emotional running back know he should expect
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon was looking for me,'' Watters said. ``He was telling me
before the game, `I'm going to look for you.' So I felt good about
it. It makes you want to get out there and get open because you
know he's going to get you the ball if you're open.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kitna-provided spark spreading to other players on
offense, Erickson said, ``Sometimes that's what a spark is. People
pick up their games because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   One good start deserves another, and Kitna will have to be even
better in this week's game against the 8-4 New York Jets at the
Meadowlands. The Jets' defense ranks fourth in the NFL, 18 spots
ahead of the Oilers, and has held four opponents to nine or fewer
points, including a 24-3 romp over the Oilers two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said Kitna will remain the starter for the remaining
four games, barring injury or a total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I'm concerned about is Jon improving this
week. He's going to have to play really well this week in New
York,'' Erickson said. ``The bottom line is consistency over a
period of time. It's not just one game.''

ITALIAN LEAGUE PURSUES SUNS' GARRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet another player with ties to the Suns may be looking overseas
for a place to play should the NBA's lockout continue.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Garrity, a 6-foot-9, 240-pound rookie forward whose rights
the Suns obtained in a trade on draft day with the Dallas
Mavericks, is being wooed by Kinder-Bologna, an Italian League
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo acknowledged that the
Italian League team is pursuing Garrity, but he would not comment
further because of restrictions imposed during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity's Washington, D.C.-based agent, Lon Babby, said
Garrity's preference is to play for the Suns as soon as possible,
but Garrity hasn't ruled out going to Italy, especially if the NBA
season is scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given it a lot of thought,'' Babby said. ``With each
passing day, it looks a little more attractive. But Pat's attitude
right now is that he has dreamed his whole life about playing in
the NBA. At this stage, he wants to be a Phoenix Sun and he wants
to be there and be ready when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his thinking now, but that could change if it looks
like the season may be canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity, who averaged 23.2 points and 8.3 rebounds a game at
Notre Dame last season, was drafted with the 19th choice of the
first round last summer by the Milwaukee Bucks. His rights were
traded along with the rights to German star Dirk Nowitzki to Dallas
for the rights to Michigan star Robert Traylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks then sent Garrity's rights, along with forward
Martin Muursepp, swingman Bubba Wells and a 1999 first-round draft
pick, to the Suns for Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA source familiar with European basketball said the
Kinder-Bologna club has had interest in Garrity since the Los
Angeles Summer Pro League, where Garrity was a standout performer.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity, who has been working out in the Valley with other
Phoenix players, apparently had little interest in the initial
attempts by Kinder-Bologna to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   But Kinder-Bologna reportedly is unhappy with forward Zarko
Paspalj, a former San Antonio Spurs player. The club renewed talks
in hopes of finding a replacement for Paspalj. Other players with
NBA ties whom Kinder-Bologna reportedly has interest in are free
agents Isaac Austin and Vlade Divac and the Suns' Muursepp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Muursepp's name has cropped up in connection with
several clubs. Israel's Maccabi Tel-Aviv reportedly had agreed to
terms with Muursepp. That deal wasn't made, and now Muursepp
reportedly is considering a Greek League club, Apollon Patron.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix free agent Marko Milic is playing for a club in the
Turkish League. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, easily the largest building block in the
foundation of the Diamondbacks' brief history, is ready for The
Question.
</P>
<P>
   The game's most dominating pitcher, who agreed to pitch for the
Diamondbacks for the next four years in exchange for more than $52
million, will be waiting for the inevitable when he is introduced
to the local media Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going want to know how I could be 9-10 with Seattle
and 10-1 with Houston last year,'' Johnson told the ``Republic''
from his Paradise Valley, Ariz., home Monday night. ``I'll tell you
exactly how I did it. Because I was happy. It's a five-letter word.
I was much happier in Houston. I was happy with the environment I
was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying in Seattle. If anyone's ever seen me on the
mound, I pitch with a lot of emotion. When you've got an employer
screwing with your head, it's kind of tough. Look at Wade Boggs and
Roger Clemens during their final years in Boston and look at what
they did after they left. I'm human. I'm no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began the 1998 season with the knowledge that Seattle
was not interested in having him back in 1999, even though in nine
seasons he had won 121 games, led the Mariners to the franchise's
only two playoff appearances, and captured a Cy Young Award
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's management publicly yanked Johnson on and off the
trading block a couple of times during the season. Johnson
eventually was sent to Houston in exchange for four prospects hours
before the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch better in Houston,'' Johnson said.
``Velocity-wise there was nothing different. I was enjoying what I
was doing. This coming year I'm going to be extremely happy. It's
pretty special to be part of a community you actually live in as
well. I'm excited about that. This is where my home is, it's where
I want my family to be and where I feel I can make the biggest
impact of the teams that wanted me to pitch for them. Plus, why not
Arizona?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will anchor what now must be considered one of the top
rotations in the National League, if not all of baseball. He will
be followed in the rotation by Todd Stottlemyre, Andy Benes, Omar
Daal and Armando Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the Atlanta Braves, no one has a rotation, front
and center, that can match Arizona's,'' Florida General Manager
Dave Dombrowski said. ``That's a championship rotation, no doubt
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, is aware of what will be expected from him.
Clearly, though, it's nothing he hasn't been prepared for in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go people expect me to win,'' Johnson said.
``It's like the playoff games; I pitched quality games, good enough
to win. But we ran into another pitcher who shut down our offense.
There are times you might lose a game where you pitched well. I
don't look at anything as pressure. I look at coming here as a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched for teams that were picked to go to the World
Series and didn't. Our Houston team was supposed to go and we
didn't get out of the first round of the playoffs. The same thing
for our '97 Mariners team. It's discouraging. But there are no
guarantees in baseball. Just like there's no guarantee we're not
going to go the World Series or win the division this coming
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turned down virtually identical offers from
Anaheim, Texas and Los Angeles, is cautious enough to realize the
Diamondbacks' chances of reaching the postseason in the coming year
remain remote. Nonetheless, he defended his decision to pitch for a
fledgling club over the more established ones he spurned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, the other teams might have better chance of
winning next year,'' Johnson said. ``But in the next four years I
think we will be competitive and go to playoffs. The City of
Phoenix will have an opportunity to watch this team grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, with all the new chemistry, it's going to take a
while for everyone to play together. By 2000, I assume we'll be
competing for a wild card at worst. At best, in 2001 and 2002 I
would say we'll be competing for an NL West title, if not sooner.
This year could be a magical and exciting year. It's not that bad
of a team. It had some holes that hopefully have been filled.'' &QL;

POLICE FIND PORNOGRAPHY, BULLETS AND BIZARRE NOTES INSIDE SUSPECT'S
APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As they stepped inside Silas Garfield Cool's dreary
apartment, Seattle homicide detectives entered the macabre world of
a lonely man and his obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the dim light of a 40-watt bulb, detectives John Nordlund,
Gene Ramirez and Stephen O'Leary found a gallery of pornography,
concealed behind a blanket and an upright inflatable bed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Metro bus schedules were stacked in an otherwise
empty bookcase near the front door. Notes written with a grease
pencil lay scattered about the kitchen, reminding Cool of the
simplest of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put plastic containers in oven,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it appeared to be the home of a guy who just seemed to
drift further and further into isolation,'' O'Leary said. ``It was
as though a transient lived there, even though he had rented it for
13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, that isolated man, Silas Garfield Cool, 43, shot
and killed Metro bus driver Mark McLaughlin, causing the bus
McLaughlin was driving to careen off the Aurora Bridge.
Thirty-three passenger were injured, one of whom died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, police confirmed Monday, took his own life with a single
shot from a cheap pocket pistol, ending the downward spiral of his
life and beginning an investigation that has yet to determine why
he killed.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight days before he erupted Cool was arrested by Mountlake
Terrace police for trying to peek at a young girl who was showering
at a public swimming pool. Cool tried to fool police by giving them
phony names, even assuming the identity of his apartment manager.
</P>
<P>
   As they sifted through the University District apartment last
weekend, where Cool's privacy and loneliness overlapped, the three
detectives found only scattered bits of puzzle _ scores of
videotapes, some in the process of being copied. Most were
commercial pornography, except for a few, including one that gave
them a start _ an old fright-film dubbed with gruesome irony:
``Horror Express.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was driving Metro route 359 _ an express route. The
film, though, deals with space aliens who kill all the passengers
on a train and steal their memories.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room of the tiny apartment, the detectives found a
rocker or easy chair that looked as though it had never been used.
There were no signs of photos, mementos or keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Living room shelves yielded two holsters and ammunition matching
the guns Cool used Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the bathroom, every available shelf and all the counter space
was covered with lotions and shaving creams, some evidently having
sat there for years, rusted to the counters, their unopened caps
still on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing positive in there,'' O'Leary said Monday.
``Except for a dark side, the place just seemed to be devoid of any
personality. It was like a neutered presence, until you got to the
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   There, the detectives found the darkness enforced by curtains
pinned shut. Behind a plastic blow-up double mattress leaning
against one wall, the officers found a collage of photos of nude
women.
</P>
<P>
   A blanket on a wire strung across the room concealed another
wall of pornographic photos, most trimmed from adult magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The only other decoration, O'Leary said, was an 8-by-10-inch
photo of Cool himself, apparently taken when he was younger and
living outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much disarray, so much disorganization,'' O'Leary
said. ``Nothing was focused in that place. There was nothing to
suggest a routine or a schedule in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, investigators matched Cool's left-index fingerprint to
one found on the magazine of a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun.
Two bullets removed from McLaughlin's body were matched last night
to the gun. Cool apparently bought the guns legally, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators came up with more questions than answers when
they explored Cool's background and questioned family members who
were equally puzzled and distraught. They found no medication in
his apartment, except for vitamins and health supplements, and no
indication he had ever sought counseling or seen a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Cool was an only child, born May 14, 1955, in Sumatra to an
American oil company accountant, Daniel Cool, and his wife, Ena.
Both now in their 80s, they declined interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Indonesia and Pakistan before settling in
middle-class Plainfield, N.J., in 1959. Cool went through the
school system, where he was known as a somewhat studious, good kid.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Birnbaum, the superintendent of North Plainfield Public
Schools, said Monday that she taught English and possibly other
subjects to Cool when she was a teacher at the high school in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very nice, very quiet, very sweet, good student, and
I am very saddened by all of this because I can't imagine that
happening to him, to have something like this happen,'' Birnbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum described North Plainfield as a safe, middle-class
suburban community, 25 miles west of New York City, that is a good
place to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it kind of a modern-day Mayberry,'' Birnbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Van Winkle, detective lieutenant of the North
Plainfield Police Department, said Cool never had any run-ins with
the law and was considered a smart kid. ``He was squeaky clean. He
was one of those average guys who fit into the community,'' Van
Winkle said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool's high school class held its 25th reunion at a New Jersey
Elk's Club on Friday _ the day of the bridge incident.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if Cool knew of the reunion, and some of the
organizers said they weren't able to contact him. But for many
people, such gatherings serve as a marker of time and stir emotions
about the past.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, Cool became an avid golfer, which he played
voraciously and which his father said contributed to his back
problem. In 1978, Cool earned a two-year degree in civil technology
in 1978 from nearby Middlesex County College in Edison, N.J., which
is about 20 miles from North Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he spent time in Durban, South Africa, although little
is known about his time there. In 1979, Cool drove cross-country to
Seattle in a vintage Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   He settled into clerical jobs, already hindered by chronic back
pain, his family told police. One was as a draftsman for a Seattle
oil company. Co-workers told KOMO-TV he quit in 1983 after the
company denied his request for a leave to return to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1984 to July 1987 Cool worked in the King County
land-use department as a building inspector. It was one of his last
jobs. His father has told police his son hasn't been employed since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   A former co-worker, who asked that his name not be used, said he
and other colleagues believe Cool may have been asked to resign
from the county job, although he wasn't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 he moved into the apartment at 5625 15th Ave. N.E.,
where he lived until his death. His neighbors and landlord said
they never knew him as anything but a name on a mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Cool has several minor misdemeanor arrests in Seattle in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, when he used the alias of Steve Gary
Cool and gave a birth date two years later than his actual date of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   In Mountlake Terrace, Cool was arrested for obstructing a police
officer after visiting a public pool.
</P>
<P>
   The father of a 13-year-old girl called police Nov. 16 after he
saw Cool in the swimming pool area of the Recreation Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The father told police that on Nov. 9 he was standing guard
while his daughter was showering in a stall at the pavilion. He
said Cool approached the stall and started to look over his
shoulder toward his daughter. He told Cool to ``back off'' and Cool
complied. When the father returned to the pavilion on Nov. 16, he
saw Cool in the pool and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Cool's family told police that he swam at the pool to relieve
his chronic back pain. When he was stopped by police, he denied he
was involved in any devious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After police ran the names, Cool clammed up and said, ``I want
to speak with my attorney,'' according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   He was booked into the Lynnwood Jail as a John Doe for
obstructing police.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief court appearance Nov. 17, Cool, in a calm voice
corrected the spelling of his name, saying it didn't have an ``e''
and gave his first name as Silas.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set Cool's bail at $1,000 cash.
</P>
<P>
   Cool posted bail after contacting A Quick Bail Bond in Everett
and was released, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed against Cool, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool's booking photographs in the Mountlake Terrace case have
become a key piece of evidence. Detectives are using it in the
flier distributed to Metro bus drivers Sunday, asking if they might
have had some trouble with him that could have made him want to
hurt a Metro driver.
</P>
<P>
   Cool's family last saw him during one of his annual visits to
New Jersey, this one from Oct. 15 to 27. They noticed nothing
unusual about him, and he engaged in his usual habit of walking
each day, or lying down to control his back pain.
</P>
<P>
   Cool's last conversation with his parents, with whom he seemed
to have a good rapport, was on Nov. 22, and he left them with no
indication that he harbored anger or resentment, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool had been unemployed since about 1991 because of his back
pain, his family told police. Since then, his parents supported
him, sending him $650 a month. After his $475 rent, he was left
with $125 to live on and frequented the Union Gospel Mission for
food, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But the apartment where Cool lived his last 13 years, surrounded
by his most personal things, yields only more questions.
</P>
<P>
   He left the bathroom windows covered with aluminum foil. The tub
didn't appear to have been used much, which didn't match the
picture of Cool's clean-cut appearance. In it was a cardboard box
with dish towels to stack more hair care and body products that
were never used.
</P>
<P>
   The tub and shower area seemed to O'Leary to have been set up
like a little desk. And he owned lots of thongs of underwear and
some men's body building magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The only other non-pornographic reading materials were a few
National Geographics. Cool also appeared to have embarked upon a
project to convert old Beta movie tapes to VHS tapes.
</P>
<P>
   And the kitchen, with its notes and empty small liquor bottles,
held not even a spice. The refrigerator contained only some frozen
food, as though eating was a necessity to be completed in the
quickest and easiest fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seemed to exist as though he never existed,'' O'Leary
said.

 &HT;    Texas family court defends its role
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In his 10 years on the bench, Judge Jim Rausch has
seen it all before _ practically every day.
</P>
<P>
   Before him a mother stands, holding in her left arm a
curly-haired baby clutching a bottle. Standing adjacent to an
assistant attorney general is the father of another of her
children, a red and blue, star-shaped tattoo on his right forearm
and another tattoo circling his left arm just below the short
sleeve of his bright orange jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The back of his jumpsuit reads ``Bexar County Jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He owes $10,200 in child support, has not paid on it in almost
two years and explains he's been unemployed for a year. ``If I'm
working, I pay,'' he tells Rausch. ``If I'm not working, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rausch looks him straight in the eye, his voice agitated. ``You
should have thought about that before you brought this child into
the world,'' he says. ``It's a tough world, isn't it, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   His judgment: six months behind bars for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If $500 is paid,'' Rausch tells him, ``the court will release
you to electronic monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the prisoner gets back to jail, the $500 is paid.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, the money used to bail out these fathers comes from
the parent who is owed the child support.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it works, time and again. In two days last week,
four of 10 fathers Rausch either threw or kept in jail for
child-support violations came up with the lump sum the judge set
for their release. One _ a ``career case,'' Rausch called him _
said he couldn't muster more than $1,000 when the judge set $2,500
as the hurdle for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the afternoon, his family paid the $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   In an often teeming courtroom, Jim Rausch speaks not so softly
and wields a big stick to collect child support _ one of Texas'
most beguiling social and political problems, with 1.1 million
active cases pending in the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Legislature searches for answers, Rausch and other
family law court masters who enforce state-supervised child-support
orders _ one of the few aspects of child support that seems to be
working _ stand to be replaced by an administrative process that is
among several proposals to resolve an almost unsolvable problem.
</P>
<P>
   A backlog of cases
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales consistently has defended his
child-support collection, pointing to a 300 percent increase since
1990 and to Texas moving from 14th to sixth in total collections.
But, just as consistently, mothers owed child support and the
lawmakers to whom they invariably complain have slammed the efforts
as ineffective, too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Dragged down by a $75 million computer that has not done what it
was supposed to do, the portion of paying cases lately has dropped
from 20 percent to 18 percent. And at the same time that caseloads
kept rising, the number in which paternity was established fell 13
percent by the end of the 1998 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the complexity of a growing social phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General-elect John Cornyn, for example, made child
support a campaign issue by saying Morales, who decided not to seek
re-election, collected only 18 cents of each dollar owed in child
support. But Cornyn's figures can be misleading because he refers
to an 18 percent collection rate for all child-support cases _ even
those in which paternity has not been established and payment
orders have not been drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch and others worry that confusion results in a proposal to
cut people like Rausch out of the process _ and to reduce due
process _ to solve problems that Rausch says he rarely deals with
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very efficient _ not perfect _ but very efficient
judicial process,'' Rausch says of what he does, ``that resolved a
great number of cases in a short period of time yet did not deny
anyone their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 budget-year tally by the Office of Court
Administration, court masters such as Rausch handled almost 175,000
legal actions filed by assistant attorneys general. Of those, the
judges disposed of 90 percent within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly contempt citations
</P>
<P>
   On this Monday in Rausch's courtroom, enforcement actions
dominate the docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw in the last two hours was 95 percent
contempt. I think I heard one paternity case,'' he says during a
morning recess. ``Paternity establishment is a small part of the
picture here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth floor of the century-old, Romanesque, red
sandstone and granite Bexar County Courthouse _ overseeing Main
Plaza, where justice has been dispensed in San Antonio for close to
300 years _ mothers and fathers called to Rausch's courtroom take
all available seats this Monday morning. More people crowd the
entry into the courtroom and spill outside the door into the
marbled hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys work in constant motion at its center. Deputy sheriffs
call for order again and again and again as people mumble and
whisper in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   His docket runs 93 cases when Rausch, who is responsible for
child support and other complex issues that go hand in hand with
it, begins calling cases at 8:30 a.m. He starts this ritual at the
same time four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rausch breaks for lunch this day, at 12:53 p.m., he
will have finished all but three cases on his docket. Another hour
in the afternoon and he will be done.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, he will have conducted one hearing on past-due
child support for a father of a 13-year-old who was not told until
years later that the child was his. He will have held a formal
rights hearing at the same time for four fathers accused of
contempt _ and facing jail _ because they have not paid child
support. And he will have ruled in perhaps 30 other individual
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efficiency, Rausch and the other 40 child-support
court masters in Texas _ judges who, as he does, can throw the book
at parents delinquent in their child-support payments _ work in the
gun sight of a proposal Morales endorses that might eliminate them.
In their place would be administrative hearing officers with power
to decide paternity and set child support but without authority to
enforce child-support orders.
</P>
<P>
   That administrative process, Morales says, would speed
child-support orders by hastening decisions establishing paternity
in cases where children have been born out of wedlock. These days,
that means as many as 30 of every 100 births in the state. Morales'
successor, Cornyn, advocates streamlined child-support
administrative proceedings not unlike those for revoking a driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' proposal would put the burden of proof on men alleged
to be fathers, leaving it up to the men to contest an allegation in
a procedure that has no judicial protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, am sick and tired of taking away people's legal
rights to make up for the faults in this system,'' state Sen. Chris
Harris, R-Arlington, told a Sunset Advisory Commission hearing
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called expedited administrative procedure _ the
cornerstone of a legislative consultant's recommendation for the
attorney general's child-support division _ would do little, by
Rausch's reckoning, to dent the never-ending cycle of enforcement
problems he handles day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in that assessment. A sunset commission staff
analysis of the consultant's report raised doubt about channeling
to a hearing officer decisions that needed a court's ruling _ and
throwing enforcement of a hearing officer's orders onto the crowded
caseloads that district judges now handle.
</P>
<P>
   Sizing up the parents
</P>
<P>
   At 49, his graying hair cut close in the style he wore as an F-4
Phantom fighter pilot in Vietnam, Rausch brings tactical zeal to
his work now. His instincts play off his experience in sizing up a
delinquent parent probably months or years past due in his child
support.
</P>
<P>
   For one father, who pleads that he has a new job and a son who
lives with him, Rausch threatens him with jail unless he can cough
up $800.
</P>
<P>
   Then, against the assistant attorney general's preference, the
judge orders the father to work release. A deputy cuffs him and
leads him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put them in jail and throw away the key,'' Rausch
says. ``What you want to do is get their attention and get a lump
sum.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his reasoning depends on 10 years of handling familiar
faces back again to be threatened or cajoled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work that way _ `Thanks, judge, it'll be OK' _ it
doesn't work that way,'' Rausch says. ``It doesn't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no closure. There's no closure to a child-support
case.''
</P>

 &HT;    Gun industry assault seen by some as payback for crime in
streets
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After watching states wring billions from Big Tobacco,
U.S. cities are embarking on what lawyers describe as Tobacco II:
an all-out legal assault on the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch is simple: Guns wreak such mayhem in our cities _
about 35,000 Americans die from gunfire each year _ that
manufacturers should pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, both New Orleans and Chicago filed suit
against the gun industry seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages. Lawyer Wendell Gauthier and other prominent plaintiffs
attorneys who led a class-action lawsuit against Big Tobacco are
bankrolling the New Orleans complaint, which closely imitates
lawsuits filed by states that sought compensation for public
expenses related to smokers' illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial said his city's taxpayers have
suffered too long from unsafe guns and the industry's ``day of
atonement'' has arrived. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley said the gun
industry knowingly floods his city with deadly weapons, making it a
willing partner of ``gangbangers, drug dealers and other
criminals.'' Chicago used an undercover police investigation to
support its case.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell supports the lawsuits by New Orleans
and Chicago, according to a spokesman, and the city is seriously
considering its own challenge. City officials in Baltimore, Boston,
Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia and San Francisco also are
considering lawsuits against the gun industry. In New York, a case
scheduled to go to trial in January seeks to hold the whole
industry liable for the negligent distribution and overproduction
of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Although gun executives contend the lawsuits are without merit,
they say the daunting task of defending such an onslaught of
litigation could cripple an industry that has much less financial
firepower than the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very real chance that a lot of the handgun
manufacturers will have to declare bankruptcy and shut their
doors,'' said Jack Adkins, operations director of the Atlanta-based
American Shooting Sports Council, an industry trade group.
``There's a feeding frenzy going on out there and the gun industry
is red meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun industry executives say they are making and selling a lawful
product in compliance with federal, state and local laws and
regulations governing firearm distribution. They contend they
should not be blamed for abuse of their product any more than
manufacturers of cars, kitchen knives or axes are blamed when these
items are used to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, who helped
prepare some of the tobacco cases, believes the gun industry is
vulnerable. He notes that the new lawsuits sidestep arguments that
the Second Amendment's right to bear arms protects gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not be able to draw a straight line from the maker of
the gun barrel to the aorta of the victim,'' Tribe said. ``But in
the way the tobacco litigation paved the way it may be possible, if
the evidence is there, to hold gun manufacturers accountable for
the aggregate death and injury that can be directly traced to their
marketing of a deadly product.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits against the gun industry are nothing new. For decades,
individuals have sued gun manufacturers charging negligence for
faulty weapon-making, such as an injury or death caused by a hair
trigger. And lawsuits have been filed against dealers who sold
handguns without telling people how to use them or to people who
shouldn't be able to buy one _ felons, drunks, minors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a 14-year-old girl shot in the head by a neighbor who
didn't know the gun was loaded won an $11 million jury verdict
against a Philadelphia gun store. According to testimony, the
shopkeeper failed to in- struct the girl's mother on how to use the
.25-caliber semiautomatic handgun when she bought it. Raven Arms,
manufacturer of the gun,had settled for almost $1 million prior to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Kitchen, a Florida woman left a quadriplegic after a
gunshot wound, won a $12.5 million verdict against K-Mart Corp. in
1993. Kitchen was shot by her ex-boyfriend, who bought a
.22-caliber bolt-action rifle at K-Mart. The store sold him the gun
even though he had drunk a fifth of whiskey and a case of beer.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, litigation against the gun industry as a
whole has grown more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit scheduled to go to trial in New York Jan. 4
names 46 gun manufacturers as defendants. The suit was filed by
families of two people shot and killed with illegally obtained
firearms. Their lawyers will argue thathandguns and their
ammunition are pathogens causing the injuries and deaths of
thousands of people, much like asbestos, Agent Orange or silicone
breast implants. They want a jury to find the industry liable for
marketing and selling handguns in a way that fosters the growth of
an underground market. This illicit gun market, the lawsuit claims,
enables youths and criminals to buy handguns easily and contributes
greatly to handgun violence in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   During pre-trial discovery in the New York case, lawyers
uncovered an industry whistleblower who has provided testimony
critical of gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hass, a former Smith &AMP; Wesson senior vice president of
marketing and sales, said the industry has been lax in trying to to
identify and investigate the retailers and wholesalers that sold
guns used to commit crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company and the industry are .. aware that the black
market in firearms is not simply the result of stolen guns but is
due to the seepage of guns into the illict market from multiple
thousands of unsupervised federal firearms licensees.'' Hass said
in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Hass also said gun manufacturers simply don't screen or
supervise sales beyond checking federal firearms licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of cases like this one, there's a growing body of
evidence,'' said Joshua Horowitz, director of the Washington-based
Firearms Litigation Clearinghouse. ``We believe at some point, a
jury will one day find that the gun industry is intentionally
marketing to criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry lawyers point to a recent jury verdict in Oakland
which shows gun manufacturers can win in court.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a jury found in favor of Beretta U.S.A. Corp., sued
by Griffin and Lynn Dix who claimed their 15-year-old son, Kenzo,
accidentally was shot and killed by a teenage friend because the
handgun was defectively designed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claimed the death could have been avoided if Beretta
had installed an internal lock on the handgun. Gun-control
advocates said the product-liability case was the first of its kind
against a gun manufacturer. The jury voted 9-3 and 10-2 in favor of
Beretta on whether the handgun was defective and whether a defect
factored substantially in Kenzo's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it gives some of these municipalities a good dose
of reality,'' Rudolph Pino, Beretta's national legal counsel, said
of the verdict. ``If they're thinking this is like tobacco
litigation where they're going to be getting hundreds of millions
of dollars, they'd better think again.''
</P>
<P>
   However, New Orleans plans to pursue its lawsuit, the first
filed by a city against the gun industry, even though it uses a
legal theory similar to the one that failed in Oakland. The city's
lawsuit claims that firearms are ``unreasonably dangerous'' because
manufacturers knowingly fail to include safety devices to prevent
children and other unauthorized users from firing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The city filed suit after the mayor's friend, Raymond Miles, a
well-known New Orleans gospel singer, was found dead on a street
corner Oct. 11 with two bullets in his back. The Chicago lawsuit
seeks $433 million in damages from 40 gun manufacturers and
dealers. The lawsuit charges the industry's marketing and sales
practices make it liable for the cost of gun violence under
``public nuisance'' laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry saturates the market with handguns that could only
be used to commit crimes, according to the lawsuit. In Chicago,
which has one of the nation's strictest gun-control laws, it's
illegal to own a gun unless it was registered before 1982. (Atlanta
has no such ordinance.)
</P>
<P>
   Chicago used an undercover police operation to support its case.
Police officers, posing as street gang members, motorcycle thugs or
camouflage-clad soldiers of fortune, bought guns from suburban
dealers even though they had no gun permit and boasted they would
use the guns to commit crimes inside the city, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins, whose Atlanta trade group has about 350 dealers and
manufacturers as members, accsuses the mayors of ``tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is litigation tyranny, with mayors thwarting the
democratic legislative process by going to the courts to establish
public policy,'' he said. ``By modeling their strategy on the
tobacco cases, handgun control groups are filing lawsuits like
throwing pasta up against the wall. They don't care if it's al
dente or well done or even if it sticks to the wall. Their idea is
to file as many suits as possible, knowing the industry cannot
defend itself against this onslaught.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Henigan, a lawyer for the Washington-based Center to
Prevent Handgun Violence and co-counsel in the New Orleans lawsuit,
concedes that the latest round of lawsuits against the gun industry
may not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that more of these cases are getting before
juries now is extremely important because it creates huge
uncertainty for the industry and could in the end bring it to the
bargaining table,'' he said. ``They never know what the next jury
will do.''

 &HT;    Amish carve own space in Sarasota nook
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ After a pitched game at the Pinecraft Park
shuffleboard courts, Omer Yoder is chatting with his friends Henry
Detweiler, Gideon Stoltzfus and Aubrey Hudson when it dawns on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only Yoder here tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The group around him _ the bearded men in black straw hats and
suspenders and women in bonnets and homemade dresses _ nod and
laugh. In fact, there is another Yoder. Lewis. But the joke is not
lost. To the outside, they know their world appears insular; its
strict tenets forbidding cars and TVs, portable phones and divorce
a little queer. Lest the funny hats obscure what this is really all
about, Stoltzfus reminds everyone:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we want to be known by what we believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Florida Amish Country, the unlikely winter home of
the Schlabachs and Knepps and a small population of mostly retired
Amish and Mennonites.
</P>
<P>
   Belief is not what brought them to this pocket of Sarasota,
where streets have names such as Graber, Kruppa and yes, Yoder, but
it is what keeps them together.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, they have forged a community 2 miles east of
Sarasota Bay where restaurants specialize in shoofly pie and
cheese, straw hats sell for $3.99 at the corner hardware store and
about a dozen churches offer varying degrees of doctrine. They
travel south by Pioneer Trails bus _ $99 round-trip from Ohio,
Pennsylvania or Indiana _ and get around town on over-sized
tricycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at us as a cult because of the dress.
They have the idea that we're very exclusive,'' said Matthias
Overholt, whose family moved to the area 43 years ago and now runs
a produce stand. ``But anyone's welcome. Our church doors are open.
Our homes are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they struggle to maintain a separation, if only for the
sake of self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   No longer isolated
</P>
<P>
   Before the movie ``Witness,'' Amish communities existed to the
outside world largely as tourist attractions, like Colonial
Williamsburg. Then earlier this year, two Pennsylvania Amish men
were arrested and charged with buying cocaine from a local chapter
of the Pagan motorcycle gang. Police alleged they sold it to young
Amish indulging in their rumschpringes, a rite of passage starting
at about age 17 when young members get to taste the world and
decide whether they want to join the church. Suddenly, reporters
from places like the Washington Post and New Yorker were dissecting
the group.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, life for young members can be even more challenging
``because of the closer proximity to town, the beaches and the
leisure lifestyle,'' Overholt said. ``In a rural setting, it's
different. But here, they don't want to ride bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, here they are, in a place of beaches and strip malls,
where life can be sometimes slow and sometimes sleazy, living in
white cottages and little urban ranch houses with miniature wishing
wells and windmills planted in their front yards.
</P>
<P>
   First arrivals started farms
</P>
<P>
   When the first members arrived from Ohio about 1925 to farm the
Florida muck for celery, they settled away from town, said Roman
``Bob'' Miller, whose grandfather and great uncle started the first
farms. Their isolation was as much as part of their convictions _
they believe true Christians should be ``nonconforming'' _ as a
longstanding tradition of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Mennonites and Amish, according to one of the many books
sold at the Der Dutchman or Dutch Haus restaurants in the
neighborhood, evolved from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th
century. A group in Switzerland, eventually called Anabaptists,
formed to create a purer church, one in which baptism was voluntary
and the church existed independent of the government.
</P>
<P>
   They were promptly slaughtered by both Reformers and the Church
of Rome. They survived only by meeting in secret, in caves and at
night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1693, a Swiss elder named Jacob Amman formed a stricter sect
_ the Amish _ because he believed the church was losing its purity.
</P>
<P>
   Amman believed if a member left the church or lied, he should be
shunned. He also introduced the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Persecution in Europe continued, so members began migrating to
North America about 1720, settling in northern states such as Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Indiana. Over time, rifts between the old order
and modern members developed. Today a range of doctrine is
practiced, explains the Rev. Barry Loop of the Bahia Vista
Mennonite Church. The largest community is in Holmes County, Ohio,
followed by Lancaster County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's Amish, there's Mennonite. We have a shared
historical perspective,'' said Loop, whose church celebrates its
50th anniversary next year.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, different sects decide where they want to draw
the lines between themselves and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people build fences high because they want to put a hedge
around their family to keep the world from coming in. Some people
build them low,'' Overholt said. ``Those of us conservatives kind
of keep our fences high.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the family drives a car, but doesn't watch TV. They
have a telephone and are weighing whether to surf the Internet, but
don't educate their children beyond the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is guard our families,'' he said.
``The closer a person walks with society, they lose their
distinctiveness and start embracing society. They start
integrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1950s, the families in Sarasota continued to farm
the area, traveling south when winter froze fields up North, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Population boom
</P>
<P>
   World War II brought a brief boom in the local population
because young men came to perform their voluntary service, a deal
with the government that excuses Amish and Mennonites from military
service and instead allows them to work at other jobs, like picking
oranges. (Their belief in peace also led to unpopular stands on
other matters: they were among the first to oppose slavery and they
object to nuclear weapons. They rarely file lawsuits.)
</P>
<P>
   Church services were usually held in homes. Up North, benches
were loaded into buggies and hauled from house to house.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1934, Miller's grandfather helped establish one of the
first churches in a two-room schoolhouse in Fruitville. By 1945,
the congregation had outgrown the building. So, after uniting with
other denominations, they bought the Sarasota Baking Company
building for $7,500. Today, it is the Tourist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's family sold their farm in 1955, with others quickly
following as property values rose and Sarasota became more
developed, he said. They continued the yearly trek and some, like
the Overholts and the Millers' children, moved down permanently.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Pinecraft became a colony of retirees.
Younger family members vacation here, usually after the Christmas
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as easy to find work anymore. You have to have
your own business, pretty near,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Sue Miller, who is not related to Bob Miller, is one of the
exceptions. Waiting for the 8:20 a.m. Sarasota County Area Transit
bus to take her to a housecleaning job on Longboat Key, she says
she moved from Ohio a year and a half ago with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fond of the summers, but I like it. It beats snow and
ice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act
</P>
<P>
   Balancing their beliefs with fast-paced Florida is not always
easy. Without horses and buggies, they rely on the SCAT buses to
travel across town or to the beach on Lido Key. More modern members
drive. Old order members ride their bikes, sometimes their lawn
mowers, Overholt said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 21, Overholt succumbed to the lure of the outside
world and left home. He moved in with an uncle and started dating a
girl ``involved in the occult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the whole disco scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he returned to the fold and today helps promote
the family's publishing business which includes a hymnal compiled
by his father and tapes of his three sisters, brother and
brother-in-law singing its selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some incongruities here,'' he has decided.
</P>
<P>
   Cottage industry serves Amish
</P>
<P>
   He's also observed over the years that carpet-baggers are
cashing in on the Amish reputation for honesty. One restaurant,
Yoders, was started by some Indiana Amish. Eventually they fell
victim to society yet continued promoting their restaurant as
Amish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing against Yoders, but I don't like to capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   A cottage industry to provide services has also sprung up. At a
house off Kaufman Avenue, rental bikes are parked in the front
yard. The Pioneer Trails bus line to Sarasota caters to Amish
almost exclusively, making a stop every Thursday at the
neighborhood post office and heading north to Amish Country on
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Pennsylvania Amish, who tend to be
wealthier, have started coming to the area, sometimes to the
chagrin of original settlers, Bob Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just buy up everything. They have big farms up there and
have a lot of money. Some houses are not too good, but the land
brings a good price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement isn't necessarily leisurely here.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Miller _ no relation to Bob or Emma Sue _ has been coming
south since 1979. He no longer farms his Ohio property full-time
but works part-time in construction while his wife cleans houses.
Self-employed Amish do not pay social security, so in old age they
rely on families and what work they can get for income.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has built models in an Orlando housing development. In
Sarasota, he stacks wood when he can.
</P>
<P>
   He left farming partly because it became so unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up North, the church used to be 95 percent farmers. You go now
and there aren't 3 percent,'' he said. ``They go to work in the
trailer factory so they can have their hobby (the farm).''
</P>
<P>
   Older women keep working
</P>
<P>
   Women do likewise. Abigail Overholt, Matthias's sister, runs the
produce stand at the busy intersection of Bahia Vista Street and
Kaufman Avenue. Emma Miller _ no relation to Bob, Emma Sue or
Nelson _ makes quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Over three days 20 to 25 women will gather in Ada Detweiler's
carport _ because it is the only space large enough _ to quilt the
fabric pieced together by Miller. As Miller and Sarah Schlabach
folded up a quilt one day last week, another woman arrived to
spread her quilt. Miller keeps a notebook with the names of the
women who helped ``so I know who helped and I can help them.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, she will make two quilts and sell them at the
February craft sale for about $500 each. Last winter, she sold
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pastime, especially for these older ladies and
widows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Pinecraft is a retirement community. Of all the
bicycles in the neighborhood, very few belong to children. A more
likely sight is Sarah Overholt walking alongside her father's
electric wheelchair and stopping to talk to an elderly neighbor who
relates the latest news from back home: her recent buggy accident.
Like a lot of other retirement villages across South Florida, lines
form at the shuffleboard courts in winter time. Only here, scores
are called out in Pennsylvania Dutch.

 &HT;    Don't expect Walkin' Lawton to slow down
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Klas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _Just hours before Lawton Chiles was to face
Jeb Bush in the only televised debate of the 1994 governor's race,
the governor of Florida played hooky on his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign staff had assembled at his Tampa hotel with mock
questions to warm him up for a feisty debate against his younger,
more telegenic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiles slipped out for a few hours and got ice cream. It was
vintage Chiles, breaking schedule to give himself some thinking
time and do something he really enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   That night, in what is considered the defining moment of his
final campaign, he delivered this line: ``The old he-coon walks
just before the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people understood what he meant _ he clearly confounded Bush
_ but the phrase crystallized the folk-hero image Chiles had
developed during four decades in public office. The line gave him
new momentum and he defeated Bush in the closest gubernatorial
election ever in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   No Florida politician has captured the imagination of the
electorate longer than Lawton Mainor Chiles Jr., first a state
representative, then a state senator, U.S. senator and, finally,
the state's 41st governor.
</P>
<P>
   His Cracker expressions were foreign to many who understood
little about the ways of old Florida. Yet the same man who wore a
coonskin cap and fired a potato gun at his second inauguration also
used his 1997 State of the State address to call attention to brain
research and the importance of a healthy early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The avid outdoorsman who chews tobacco and hunts turkeys also
spent every ounce of his political capital to fend off a
legislative assault on a state lawsuit against the nation's
cigarette giants. The victory will reap $13 billion for Florida
during the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   When Chiles retires in January at age 68 and hands over his
command to Bush, he will end a 40-year political career that began
when Eisenhower was president and Bush was in first grade. It will
be the end to a job he never expected to have but enjoyed more than
any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 times better than being in the (U.S.) Senate,''
Chiles said recently, referring to the job of his boyhood dreams,
which he quit in 1988 out of frustration. ``The game doesn't start
until you blow the whistle and if you don't like something in the
main ring, you can start something somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was good at starting fights. He forced legislators to
focus on children's issues, government reform, managed care,
welfare reform and tobacco litigation long before most other
politicians were ready to talk about them.
</P>
<P>
   His skills made admirers out of many Republicans, even political
opponents. Florida Republican Party leader Tom Slade called him a
clever strategist whose political timing and instincts are ``the
best I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Smith, former Florida secretary of state who unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1994, believes
Chiles ``will be a legend in Florida politics,'' and, ``because of
the tobacco settlement, will be recognized nationally as a governor
that gave that issue prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chiles never lost an election, he did lose his share of
battles. Faced with a recession in 1991 that forced $2 billion in
budget cuts, Chiles accelerated his government reform efforts and
was compelled to seek tax reform earlier than he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my head handed to me,'' Chiles recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of cronyism pained him
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to abandon a sweeping health insurance reform when
legislators refused to give it a hearing. And his image was
tarnished by multiple allegations of political cronyism and charges
that his 1994 campaign was behind a smear campaign that used
misleading phone calls to senior citizens to frighten them away
from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in what is perhaps the most paradoxical failure, this
popular and influential governor leaves office with his party in
such disrepair that he may be the last Democratic governor for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the last of the true Southern Democrats in
Florida,'' said David Colburn, a history professor at the
University of Florida and a gubernatorial scholar. He believes
Chiles belongs alongside Leroy Collins, Reubin Askew and Bob Graham
as moderate Democrats whose progressive policies and political
skills left lasting change.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiles' shortcoming ``is not recognizing and not doing
enough to ensure his party's viability,'' Colburn said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chiles began his political career in 1958, he registered as
a Democrat out of sheer convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, there was sort of a no-party situation in
Florida,'' Chiles recalled. ``As Republicans slowly became more of
a factor, they were always more disciplined, more organized.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Democrats had no unified message. Their top
officials were elected on the sheer strength of their personality
and often sounded like Republicans. What's more, Democrats had
failed to groom proteges.
</P>
<P>
   So when former U.S. Rep. Buddy MacKay persuaded Chiles in 1990
to step out of retirement and run for governor, the Democratic
dream team was created with recycled talent. Its success delayed
the Republican takeover of Florida government, but did not stop it.
(The Florida Legislature went Republican in 1996 and Bush won the
governor's race this year, signaling the first complete takeover in
more than a century.)
</P>
<P>
   Chiles simply didn't believe that invigorating the party was his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only person that could have had the coordination to
make the organization work,'' said Buzz Ritchie, former House
Democratic leader. ``It wasn't a priority for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Chiles is a study in contrasts. He always seemed aware of
nuances regarding dozens of issues that swirled around him each
day. But he was never able to say much about them spontaneously.
Pundits alternately described him as vague and befuddled or folksy
and charming. All fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Doug Cook, his former Washington aide
whom Chiles named head of his Agency for Health Care
Administration, ``he's not a new-age communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump skit stumped him
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 press skits, an Orlando Sentinel reporter
portrayed Chiles as Forrest Gump, the movie character whose
simpleness was perceived as wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the skit, Rhea Chiles turned to her husband and
whispered: ``Honey, you're Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredulous, Chiles whispered back: ``I'm not that dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea replied: ``You're not that smart either.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles never came across as an intellectual, but most who have
worked with him say he has a swiftness of thought, a shrewd sense
of the public and an understanding of government that made him a
formidable leader.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent rap on Chiles among Tallahassee lobbyists and
lawmakers is that he is detached, uninterested in details. But
those who have worked closely with him say that was how Chiles kept
people from bombarding him with arguments when he wanted those
conversations to be handled by staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has won more than one battle by having someone
underestimate him,'' said Dan Stengle, Chiles' general counsel.
``It doesn't bother him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final State of the State speech in March, Chiles ended
his remarks with this advice: ``The best way to achieve leadership
is to learn more about your subject than anyone else and to work
harder. . . . Be bold _ dare to look foolish. Reach beyond your
grasp and go beyond the path you can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents ingrained values
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was reared during World War II in Lakeland by a father
who worked on the railroad and a deeply religious mother. They
ingrained in him the values that have guided his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles believes that, to follow his faith, he has a spiritual
and moral obligation to serve others, said Cook, his long-time
aide. The governor regularly conducts a Bible class for a small
group of friends and staff, often assigning them readings. And he
keeps a worn, leather-bound Holy Bible in his small, private
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a much more religious man than he ever lets you know,''
said Dexter Douglass, his former law school buddy who was his
general counsel in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's upbringing also inspired a profound sense of
loyalty to his friends, a virtue some of his staff admit has been
his Achilles' heel. His willingness to overlook the faults of his
friends produced some of his most trying days. He was forced to
withdraw the nomination of a hunting buddy and political activist,
Joe Bruner, from the game commission after it was revealed Bruner
had been cited for hunting without a license. He was chided for
accepting dozens of plane rides from friends, most of them hunting
partners, without reporting them as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But his most painful experience was his decision to fire one of
his dearest friends, his chief inspector general, Harold Lewis,
whom he had known since they met at Boys State. The Florida
Department of Law Enforcement had begun investigating Lewis when
questions surfaced about loans between him and a private lawyer
working on the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Firing friend hurt him deeply
</P>
<P>
   The incident ``broke his heart,'' said Mallory Horne, a longtime
friend and adviser to Chiles. ``He just didn't talk about it. It's
like none of that ever existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was one of many longtime friends Chiles hired to work in
the top jobs of his administration. ``He wanted people he could
trust,'' Douglass explained. Public service was the greatest
calling to Chiles, ``He walked the line between total loyalty to
his friends and his loyalty to government.''
</P>
<P>
   When life in Tallahassee got too intense, Chiles would get back
on the road, his staff said, where he learned from his now-famous
walk across the state in 1970 that he could get direction,
inspiration and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have him in the office too long, it shows,'' said April
Herrle, the governor's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes getting on the road meant getting behind the wheel.
Before he was first inaugurated, Chiles was caught going 80 mph in
a 50-mph zone driving his red Sterling through Bainbridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   With Chiles in his old hunting clothes, the officer didn't
believe him when Chiles said he was Florida's new governor. The
officer's response to the news: He gave Chiles a Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many ``car incidents,'' which have prompted
Rhea Chiles to quip: ``I always said he had to start walking
because nobody wanted him to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone so energized by people, Chiles is, by most accounts,
a solitary man.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loner among thousands,'' observed Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Craves solitude of preserve
</P>
<P>
   Chiles spends much of his private time time hunting and fishing,
often at his 209-acre hunting preserve west of Tallahassee, called
Chemonie. The place became somewhat of a pauper's Camp David for
Chiles, a back-to-nature refuge from the relentless demands of the
office, equipped with only a one-room log cabin and a cook shack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like to talk much when he's out there,'' said
Horne, who often accompanied Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   He loves turkey hunting but he won't shoot the turkeys on his
land. When he bags his prey, he is known to put them directly into
the mansion freezer, feathers and all, and is fond of cooking it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite snack is icebox cookies, a spice cookie he insists
be made using his mother's recipe. He also loves coarse grits and
Cuban food. He also acquired an enduring taste for sushi while
serving as an Army artillery officer in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles is best known among his friends as a practical joker for
his famous ``gotchas.'' When President Clinton had dinner at the
mansion, Chiles arranged to have a server return a full plate of
food to the kitchen to make his worried chef think it was the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   And when former press secretary Ron Sachs was losing sleep over
allowing the governor to don a flak jacket in front of television
cameras while touring Miami in the wake of a series of tourist
shootings, Chiles convened a meeting of the state's top law
enforcement officials and had them all wear flak jackets when Sachs
walked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   During eight years as governor, Chiles has remained lean and
lanky. His once-sandy hair is now solidly silver. His round
shoulders have gotten a bit more stooped. He now wears a tiny
hearing aid in his right ear. He is off Prozac, the anti-depressant
he took after leaving the U.S. Senate in a bout of depression. But
he keeps a vigorous schedule that begins at dawn on his stationary
bike and continues long after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles has preferred not to speculate on his legacy, except to
say that he hopes politicians will fight over who among them can do
better for children. He and Rhea have bought a home on 40 acres
north of town and renovated it, complete with a bird observation
window.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles plans to enjoy his last month at the Governor's Mansion.
His four children and their families joined him and Rhea for
Thanksgiving there and the first couple has lined up more than a
dozen goodbye events at the mansion for staff, colleagues and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he doesn't know what he'll do when he retires. His
friends expect him to extend a hand of friendship to Bush and stay
active in children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   But many are worried he won't be busy enough.
</P>
<P>
   Said Horne: ``I don't even think he'll be able to stand it for a
month.''

 &HT;    Wild hogs the state's new scourge
 &HT;    By Willie Howard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wild hogs are rooting up Florida,
scarring the land, spreading nuisance plants, carrying disease and
creating headaches for managers of parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at a wild hog the same way we look at melaleuca
trees,'' said Robert Dye, manager of Myakka River State Park, where
a trapper removes 800 pigs annually just to control the population.
``One pig is too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pigs are pests to land managers such as Dye, hunters
love them. Some hunters want to extend the season for hunting pigs
on public land. At the same time, animal rights advocates want the
state to crack down on what they say is inhumane treatment of pigs
removed by trappers from state parks and preserves, where hunting
is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe hog populations are on the increase,'' said Nick
Wiley, chief of wildlife management for the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. ``Hunting with liberal seasons and bag
limits is effective at holding them at manageable levels. But
eradication takes trapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigs are not native to Florida. They were introduced by Hernando
DeSoto when he landed near Tampa Bay in 1539. And they have few
remaining natural enemies, such as the panther, to control their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wild pigs are the same animal, Sus scrofa , as domesticated
pigs. They're typically black, dark brown or dark red and weigh 100
to 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The state's feral pig population has been estimated at 400,000,
though some wildlife experts believe the state harbors as many as 1
million free-roaming swine. Sows reproduce twice a year and deliver
an average of six piglets each time. The piglets, in turn, reach
sexual maturity in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs eat roots, acorns, palmetto berries, worms and snakes,
gobbling up food eaten by native animals such as white-tailed deer
and wild turkeys. They also eat the eggs of native animals,
including those of snakes, ground-nesting birds, alligators and sea
turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pig is a pig is a pig, and you'd better believe they eat a
lot of anything,'' said Kim Delozier, a wildlife biologist at Great
Smokey Mountains National Park in Tennessee, where 300 pigs are
removed from the land annually to minimize their effect on plants
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral and the nearby Merritt Island National
Wildlife Refuge, trappers remove more than 2,000 wild pigs
annually. Using dogs and traps, they took 3,384 pigs from the
refuge last year. The Space Coast pigs have eaten sea turtle eggs;
NASA employees have hit them with their cars on the way to work.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the pig population is considered especially
important near the Kennedy Space Center because pigs can dig under
the fence that protects the space shuttle runway, though pigs have
never interfered with a shuttle landing.
</P>
<P>
   Wild pigs also contribute to the spread of noxious plants such
as the tropical soda apple. They eat the soda apple's acrid fruit,
then plant the seeds when they defecate in areas they've rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Because wild pigs can carry brucellosis, a blood-borne disease
that causes a recurrent fever, sweating and joint pain, hunters
must wear plastic gloves when cleaning them. Trapped wild pigs must
be separated from domestic pigs to prevent the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Feral pigs can be hard to spot in palmetto thickets, especially
in hot months when they stay in low-lying swamps and thick
underbrush. But their calling cards are unmistakable: deep furrows
created by rooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want them rooting up native vegetation,'' said Bert
Trammel, manager of the Dupuis Reserve in northern Palm Beach and
southern Martin counties, where hog-tilled turf looks like the work
of a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters killed 199 wild pigs last year at Dupuis Reserve. But
hunting is not allowed at state parks, where trappers capture the
pigs in cages baited with rotting corn or nab them with
pig-tracking dogs that grab them by the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Dog hunting and trapping have drawn fire from animal rights
groups. The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida wrote a letter to
Gov. Lawton Chiles, urging him to ensure that hogs do not suffer
when trapped in pens or captured by tracking dogs. The foundation
asked the game commission to develop guidelines to ensure that
hunters and trappers cause feral pigs no needless suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals are not here of their own volition,'' ARFF
director Joe Taksel wrote in a June 29 letter to Chiles. ``The
state has no right to cause them needless suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles has asked state land managers to review their
hog-trapping policies to ensure the pigs are captured and
transported in a humane manner. But he noted that hog trapping must
continue as a management tool on public land.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Bryan, park management specialist with the state Department
of Environmental Protection, said pigs must be removed to keep them
in check at state parks. ``If we did nothing, the places would be
overrun,'' Bryan said. ``Every one you take off, there's going to
be less damage to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Palm Beach County's natural areas, purchased with money
from a $100 million, voter-approved bond issue, harbor wild pigs.
``We do realize they're a problem we're going to have to deal
with,'' said Frank Griffiths, who manages the natural areas for the
county.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffiths does not consider the pigs a physical threat to
visitors unless they're cornered or harassed. ``Their natural
instinct is to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although park managers loathe Florida's wild pigs, hunters love
them. They're plentiful, cagey and tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see them in the woods,'' said Robert Stossel Jr., a
West Palm Beach hunter and director of the Florida Wildlife
Federation. ``They've been here 500 years. I think they've got a
right to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Keith Jones of Lake Worth wants the game commission to
consider expanding the season for hog hunting to include some
summer hunts on wildlife management areas and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   On private land, pigs can be removed at any time of year
regardless of their size and are considered the livestock of the
landowner.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Fulford, owner of a 6,500-acre ranch in western Okeechobee
County, takes about 100 pigs a year from his land. Hunting pigs
provides food and allows Fulford to manage the pig population on
his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   When pigs root up his cattle-grazing pastures, Fulford said, the
damage can last 10 years. ``They can literally root up the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent dog hunt for pigs near Fulford's ranch with hunting
guide Ernie Goolsby and fellow dog hunter David Bruner, the hunters
let their dogs roam the land and followed them in four-wheel-drive
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked the dogs downwind of the oak hammocks where they
expected to find pigs feeding on fallen acorns, the dogs paused
from time to time to sniff the wind for the scent of swine.
</P>
<P>
   As they neared a small drainage canal, the dogs took off running
and started barking. Bruner and fellow hunter David Godfrey
followed the dogs across the canal, where they had cornered a small
pig. They rolled the pig on its back and killed it with a pocket
knife.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a multicolored pig came running across the
canal and Goolsby turned loose his catch dog, Blue, which ran out
of sight chasing the pig. Goolsby followed them in his bucking
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   When he caught up with Blue, the dog had lost the multicolored
pig and captured a young black boar by the ear. Goolsby, a veteran
rancher and cowboy, held the small boar down with his foot and
neutered it. The neutered boar will grow fatter than a nonneutered
one, Goolsby said, and it won't continue to sire piglets.
</P>
<P>
   Pig hunting with dogs has been a tradition on Florida ranches
for decades. Goolsby, 35, learned to capture hogs with dogs at age
15. Friends and relatives often gather on the Fulford ranch for
weekend hunts, which sometimes last late into the night and include
the children.
</P>
<P>
   Cur hounds used to track and hold wild pigs are often working
ranch dogs used to herd cattle. Pig hunting imposes risks on the
dogs because big boars have tusks that can wound or kill a dog. But
cur dogs aren't the least bit intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bred into them to be aggressive for that kind of
hunting,'' said Claude Thomas of the National Cur and Feist
Breeders Association. ``They're extremely strong dogs that could go
all night for a month in a row if they needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, too, can be gouged by a tusky boar that has been
captured by dogs. Goolsby has a few scars on his hands. Bruner said
he has never been cut after 25 years of hog hunting, but he has
friends who have gotten stitches.
</P>
<P>
   As with the dogs, the risk of going mano a mano with a wild boar
doesn't deter those who love dog hunts for pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real adrenaline rush,'' Bruner said.

 &HT;    Ex-Gov. Clements credited with GOP revival
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Twenty years after he pulled off the
Texas political upset of the century, ex-Gov. Bill Clements, the
Republican who started it all, has gone to the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Now a robust 81, Clements observes, but does not play, politics.
He spends several days a week at the ranch in Forney, near Dallas,
that he has owned since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he watched something that seemed unfathomable in
1978, when he beat Democrat John Hill and became the first Texas
Republican elected to a major state government post since
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't ever anticipate in my lifetime that I'd see
it,'' Clements said of the Election Day sweep that will put all
statewide offices in Republican hands come January. ``The political
system in Texas has just turned itself inside out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his place in the state's political history, Clements has
never been afforded a high-profile thank-you from the Republican
Party. And for Clements, who didn't do much politics before his
1978 race and hasn't done much since he left office in 1991, that's
fine.
</P>
<P>
   He said he turns down invitations to state Republican
conventions. He has been to Austin only twice since he was replaced
by Ann Richards in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never in politics until I was elected governor,'' he
said. ``I was a drilling contractor. So when I left office, I went
back to do the things I like to do and associate with the people
that I was the closest to.''
</P>
<P>
   That group does not include many politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a part of my past I don't care anything about
continuing into my later years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant hero
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&AMP;M,
Clements' one-man role in reshaping the state's political landscape
was in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak today in honor of an extraordinarily important figure
in modern Texas political life,'' Austin political consultant Karl
Rove, who was on board for the 1978 race, said in a lecture
entitled ``One Man Did Make a Difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That extraordinarily important figure was an audience member,
clad in a patterned sport coat more understated than the screaming
plaid ones that burdened his closets while he was in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rove argues that Clements gives lie to the conventional
political wisdom that says no one candidate or campaign can spark
major change unless that change was already in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in 1978 give context to the magnitude of Clements'
accomplishment. Texas Republicans held one U.S. Senate seat, two
U.S. House seats, 18 of the 150 state House seats and three of the
31 state Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 116 years since a Republican had been elected
governor. And GOP presidential candidates had carried Texas only
four times in the 28 White House races since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``In East Texas, they said they hunted Republicans,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Farming rural roots
</P>
<P>
   Clements won in 1978 by working hard in rural Texas, offering a
businessman's background and dipping into his deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal resources made it possible for him to promise
victory-starved Republicans that he wouldn't run out of gas like
Republican candidates had done in the closing months of other
campaigns,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Clements benefited from a Democratic Party rift slow to heal
after then-Attorney General John Hill defeated Gov. Dolph Briscoe
in the spring primary. Hill, and most thinking Texans, assumed form
would hold and that the primary win was tantamount to election.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, and Texas, had not seen anything quite like the crusty
Clements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clements was different,'' Rove said. ``While he lived in
Dallas' tony Highland Park, Bill Clements is more a product of
Forney'' and the rural towns where he worked as a roughneck.
</P>
<P>
   He knew rural Texas, and he knew that he had to cut into
Democratic margins there to win.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in 1978, he was defeated by Democrat Mark White in
1982 but came back to unseat White in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactically and strategically, knowing or unknowing, Bill
Clements built the Republican Party in Texas in a way that no other
Republican president or senator or congressman could do,'' Rove
said.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse by courthouse, coffee shop by coffee shop, candidate
Clements built a ground game to support the high-dollar airwaves
game he mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small-town Texas, it matters what goes on at the coffee
shops,'' Rove said. ``That was the chatter around town for the next
several days. And it was a chatter that affected people's
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffee shop circuit, generally, went well for Clements,
whose style was molded in oil fields and boardrooms and is not
necessarily long on warm and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign curmudgeon
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, campaigning at a McKinney ice cream parlor, Clements
was disgruntled when he wasted a pitch on two families who were
from out of state and not much interested in the gubernatorial
race.
</P>
<P>
   A third family, unaware of what had happened at the other
tables, was confronted with an agitated man who opened with this
line: ``Where are you from, Timbuktu?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after he became the first Texas Democrat since
Reconstruction to lose a statewide race, Hill is aware _ and leery
of _ his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely you are not going to run a story blaming John Hill,''
he said of the recent GOP sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican trend would have set in even if he had won, Hill
said. He believes he fell victim to things over which he had
control and things over which he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that the fact I was showing a strong lead
with about a week to go _ 11 points _ that might have lulled us to
sleep a little bit,'' he said. ``We didn't spend a lot of money on
television those last critical two weeks. And he did. That made a
big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that hurt Hill was a precursor to the religious
right movement that has played a significant role in GOP growth. As
attorney general, Hill led the effort to force Corpus Christi
evangelist Lester Roloff to get state-required licenses for his
children's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Roloff mounted a high-volume, high-profile campaign to paint
Hill, a church-going man, as a political anti-Christ.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Hill believes he fell victim to the genesis of what
became a major religious-political force in Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the great ironies of Texas politics, Roloff died in a
plane crash in November 1982 on the day Democrat Mark White
unseated Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Clements and wife Rita, who was a player in Republican politics
long before he got involved, now split time among their home in
Dallas, their ranch in Forney and their Taos, N.M., summer place.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said the ranch is his primary interest. ``The rest of
the time, I'm trying to improve my golf score,'' said Clements, who
usually shoots 90 to 95.
</P>
<P>
   A big Bush backer
</P>
<P>
   The first GOP governor of Texas since Reconstruction counts
himself as a major fan of the second GOP governor of Texas since
Reconstruction. Clements, who skipped over home-state Sen. Phil
Gramm and backed California Gov. Pete Wilson's short-lived 1996
presidential bid, believes Gov. George W. Bush will run for
president and win in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll help him in any way I can,'' Clements said. ``I think he
would be outstanding. He has a good mind. He physically is a strong
person. He has a great background because of his association with
his mother and father. He is different than his father; he is a
tougher individual than his father. He is stronger-minded. He is
his mother's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements' critics, including some who worked for him, say
privately that the 1986 run was motivated solely by a desire to
unseat White.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Clements, insisting that his comeback was
motivated by pure thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a serious contribution to make,'' he said,
adding a hint of a note of revenge. ``And I didn't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed by age, and long removed from front-line politics,
Clements still sometimes shows his prickly side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Paul) Hobby would be stronger than he was,'' he
said, referring to the Democratic comptroller nominee who lost a
close race to Carole Keeton Rylander last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might have been if he had a different father,'' Clements
added, calling on his longstanding animus for former Lt. Gov. Bill
Hobby, who is considered an icon among many Texas Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   From his elbow came a word or two of advice from the always more
politically attuned half of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to quit being so outspoken about that,'' Rita
Clements told her husband, as if he is an 81-year-old looking to
change his ways.

 &HT;    Cheaper homes on the range lure teachers
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNI, Texas _ With demand for teachers so acute in Texas that
big-city school districts are offering cash signing bonuses,
out-of-the-way districts such as Webb Consolidated _ which draws
students from the small towns and ranches east of Laredo _ are
relying on subsidized housing to lure new educators.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting a practice that dates back to the frontier days,
when towns built living quarters for the schoolmarm, Webb
Consolidated Independent School District is offering teachers an
apartment in a district-owned complex next to the football field or
in any one of a dozen houses and mobile homes spread out over
district property in Bruni and nearby Oilton.
</P>
<P>
   The rent: $250 a month for two bedrooms, $300 a month for three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the school not had housing, I wouldn't have come,'' said
Phil Worley, an Austin native who has taught at Webb Consolidated
for 10 years and lives in one of the district's gray double-wide
mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   This little-known teacher perk isn't unique to Webb County.
Although the state doesn't keep track of how many districts offer
housing, as many as two dozen Texas school districts, mostly in
West Texas and along the border, own ``teacherages'' as
school-owned housing is known, said Dane Adkinson, a personnel
consultant at the Texas Association of School Boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps it's making a little bit of a comeback,''
Adkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb Consolidated, which covers 800 square miles of oil-rich
brushland and has 45 teachers for about 450 students, got into the
housing business a decade ago out of necessity, said David Jones,
the district's superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   In this part of South Texas, where oil and gas and livestock pay
the bills for many families, land rarely changes hands, and rental
property is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place to live, and if you're going to attract a
decent staff, one of the things you can do is provide teacher
housing,'' Jones said. ``The amenities of life are an hour to an
hour and a half away. Doctors, Wal-Marts, things like that are just
not in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   So over the past decade, Jones' district has built a 12-unit
apartment building and six houses and has bought six manufactured
homes _ becoming the biggest renter in Bruni and Oilton, which have
a combined population of about 1,150.
</P>
<P>
   The district is the area's social hub _ Jones said more than
1,200 people packed the gymnasium last year to watch 37 seniors
graduate _ and has a healthy tax base, a well-equipped vocational
technology center and an enviable teacher-to-student ratio.
</P>
<P>
   But housing, Jones said, has become one of its most valuable
recruiting tools.
</P>
<P>
   Districts such as Presidio, near Big Bend, and United, on the
outskirts of Laredo, are now taking a hard look at building their
own housing in the near future as their enrollment _ and need for
teachers _ grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going out and looking for beginning teachers, it's
a big draw,'' said Bob McCall, superintendent of the
Iraan-Sheffield Independent School District in Pecos County, east
of Fort Stockton. The district, with 600 students and 53 teachers,
owns 12 apartments and 27 houses and rents three-bedroom homes for
$165 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of times it's the difference between (teachers)
coming here and going somewhere else because we're so isolated,''
McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   District as developer
</P>
<P>
   This 19th-century solution has run into 20th-century problems,
however _ particularly at Webb Consolidated. The district has
repeatedly tangled with the county planning department, which has
at times refused to approve electricity connections for district
housing, saying the district has become a developer and must abide
by local development codes _ particularly those that set a minimum
size for lots to allow room for proper septic tank drainage. The
towns where the schools are located have no sewer systems.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say their refusal to connect electricity has
forced the district to reluctantly comply with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says the district's housing should be considered school
buildings and should be exempt from rules applied to developers.
Earlier this month, however, the Texas attorney general's office
sided with the county, handing down an opinion that the district
indeed has become a ``subdivider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing's just ridiculous,'' said Jones, adding that
the district's housing has water and sewage systems that meet
county codes. ``We are not in the development business; we are in
the teaching business.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkinson, the school board association official, said some urban
districts have cut deals with local apartment owners to waive
security deposits or offer reduced rents for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts offer signing bonuses, additional retirement
accounts and bonuses for teachers who go back to school and get
certified to teach other subjects, said Stephanie Korcheck,
director of policy and planning for the State Board for Educator
Certification.
</P>
<P>
   Perks falling short
</P>
<P>
   Still, there aren't enough teachers to go around. With the
economy booming, the private sector has plucked many educators from
schools, and 40 to 50 percent of newly certified teachers are
taking nonteaching jobs with better pay and benefits, Korcheck
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere that I go . . . (school administrators) are out
there going to other states and even other countries to bring
people to their school districts, and they're just not finding
anyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of teachers is a big reason why Presidio
Independent School District, on the Rio Grande northwest of Big
Bend National Park, is thinking about building housing or
converting existing buildings into dwellings, said Teloa Swinnea,
the district's director of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment has increased by 200 students this year to 1,380, she
said, and the district has gone as far away as Germany _ where it
found two teachers through an international exchange program _ to
fill vacant positions. District officials hope to bring teachers
from Spain under a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so remotely located, we need ways to attract teachers
to our district,'' Swinnea said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools ponder projects
</P>
<P>
   At United Independent School District, which wraps around Laredo
and is growing so fast that four new elementary schools will be
added next year, construction manager Greg Chavarria said the
school board is mulling over a plan to build a 48-unit apartment
complex on school property.
</P>
<P>
   The building would ideally be paid for with tax-exempt bonds,
which would be paid back with the reduced rents teachers would pay,
Chavarria said.
</P>
<P>
   In Valentine, another West Texas town where teacher housing has
been around for years, Superintendent Mike Pate said expansion is
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   The Valentine Independent School District, with 11 teachers and
just 55 students, already has eight housing units _ three mobile
homes, a triplex and two houses. Pate thinks the lack of available
housing in town has stunted the district's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing is a problem here, and the school district has a lot
of property around town, so we're thinking of getting into
(building) even deeper,'' Pate said. ``We feel like if we had a few
more family dwellings that we might have a few more kids.''

 &HT;    U.S. Sugar refines its product in new plant
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Corporate secrets don't keep in this company
town.
</P>
<P>
   But it was imperative the Delta project _ the code name U.S.
Sugar Corp. gave its new refinery _ be kept under wraps while in
the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to look without creating a big furor in the
industry,'' said Murray Brinson, who in 1992 began touring sugar
mills and refineries in the United States and abroad as a company
spy, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As senior vice president of sugar processing, Brinson had to
gather enough information on the sly to allow U.S. Sugar to make
this important decision: to build or not to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decided not to do it, we wanted to just quietly fold our
tent,'' said Brinson, whose company for 67 years has produced raw
sugar and sold it to refiners that then made it into white sugar
and resold it.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of folding its tent, U.S. Sugar put one up last
month to welcome the more than 600 people who came to tour its new
refinery _ the computer-driven, $70 million-plus crown jewel of its
sugar empire.
</P>
<P>
   As the first cane sugar refinery to be built in the United
States in more than 25 years, the complex includes the industry's
most highly automated and sophisticated machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Brinson and his team shopped the world for the very best,
picking a Swiss company to make its high-speed packaging lines and
South African and German firms for other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar will say only that it cost more than $70 million to
build the Clewiston refinery _ though sugar industry analysts put
the cost closer to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude, size and capabilities of it were just a little
bit beyond anything I've ever seen,'' said Moira Saucer, a
spokeswoman for the Sugar Association, a Washington group that
promotes the nutritional aspects of sugar, who attended the grand
opening.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how automated the 12-story,
300,000-square-foot plant is, consider this: It can be run by four
people.
</P>
<P>
   All that's needed is one operator in the computer control room,
one at the centrifugals _ machines that separate sugar crystals
from liquid _ and two roving operators.
</P>
<P>
   Another 150 people handle packaging, warehousing, distribution,
lab work and other support activities. Many U.S. Sugar workers
transferred to the refinery from other positions, leaving openings
elsewhere in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Once the refinery is running at its 1,800-tons-a-day capacity _
as the sugar harvest hits full swing in the next couple of months _
it will add about 170 jobs to U.S. Sugar's total employment.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a typical refinery of this size would employ
about 300.
</P>
<P>
   An international operation
</P>
<P>
   ``The most amazing thing to me was the lack of people,'' said
Dalton Yancey, executive vice president of the Florida Sugar Cane
League, a research and lobbying group whose members include U.S.
Sugar, the sugar companies owned by the Fanjul family of Palm Beach
and other growers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the warehouse, a robotic arm plucks 40-pound bundles
from packing lines and swiftly but gingerly places them this way
and that on pallets that are then stacked by forklift drivers.
</P>
<P>
   SIG, a Swiss company that makes industrial machinery, guns and
other tools and equipment, made two of the three packaging lines,
which pack 2-, 4- and 5-pound bags for retail sale.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are controlled by computers hooked by modem to
Switzerland, where technicians troubleshoot from nearly 5,000 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the lines worked with materials the Clewiston plant
would use, the company shipped nearly 1,000 pounds of sugar along
with giant rolls of packaging paper to Switzerland for testing.
</P>
<P>
   SIG assembled the lines and ran them with Florida-grown sugar
before sending them to Clewiston. In addition, U.S. Sugar sent
about a dozen mechanics, operators and electricians to Switzerland
for training.
</P>
<P>
   The long trips and 60-hour workweeks took their toll on
Clewiston families. ``They've put up with a lot in the last three
years,'' said Brinson, who is married and has two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   But folks in Clewiston understand one thing, Brinson said:
``When the company does well, we do well.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar, which employs about 3,500 during the sugar cane and
citrus harvests, is owned primarily by its employees and charitable
foundations set up by its founder, Charles Stewart Mott.
</P>
<P>
   The Clewiston refinery is clearly the biggest investment the
company has ever made _ and it's one U.S. Sugar, with nearly a
half-billion dollars in annual sales, is counting on for its
future.
</P>
<P>
   With raw sugar prices essentially flat for years, U.S. Sugar
decided in the early 1990s that it needed a vehicle for growth.
</P>
<P>
   After considering businesses as diverse as making ethanol to
manufacturing cosmetics ingredients from sugar cane byproducts, the
company settled on refined sugar _ which fetches a higher price
than the raw product.
</P>
<P>
   Raw sugar sells for 21 to 22 cents a pound, while bulk white
sugar goes for 28 to 30 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Building, rather than buying, a refinery made the most sense
primarily because the company's Clewiston mill can feed raw sugar
directly to the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to its efficiency, company officials say, U.S.
Sugar has removed three steps that take place in a typical
refinery: affination, which strips molasses from sugar crystals;
clarification, which removes organic matter from liquid sugar; and
remelting, which extracts sucrose from molasses.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made some proprietary changes to these processes
and does them in the mill, instead of at the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar is counting on these efficiencies to help it make a
better return than its competitors on the table sugar it will sell
to a growing South Florida population and a legion of giant
industrial users such as candy makers Nestle and Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   Effect on other refineries
</P>
<P>
   The sugar refining industry has shrunk over the past 20 years,
with smaller stand-alone refineries closing. Since 1981, 12 U.S.
refineries have closed, according to the U.S. Cane Sugar Refiners'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Those closings happened after sugar prices fluctuated wildly in
the 1970s and again in the 1980s when the federal sugar program,
which regulated the amount of sugar in the U.S., was not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The price swings spurred soft-drink makers to switch from sugar
to high-fructose corn syrup, further hurting the sugar refiners.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Kominus, president of the Washington-based Refiners'
Association, said he hopes U.S. Sugar's entry into refining doesn't
force more cane refiners out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Sugar, which had been shipping raw sugar to other
refineries, is now going to be siphoning off a good slug of that
and refining it themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members, which refine and sell sugar to large users
such as candy makers, is at odds with U.S. Sugar and other sugar
producers over the federal sugar quota program, which limits
imports to protect the domestic crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be less raw sugar out there (now that U.S. Sugar is
refining much of its sugar product), and it's going to be a
difficult period for the existing refineries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Including the new U.S. Sugar refinery, there are just 11
refineries left in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is owned by U.S. Sugar competitor Florida Crystals
Corp., which controls the Florida businesses owned by the Fanjul
family. But the Florida Crystals' refinery _ at the Okeelanta mill
near South Bay _ can handle only about a third of the 700,000 tons
of raw sugar the company produces each year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the U.S. Sugar refinery can produce 540,000 tons of
refined sugar a year and has room to double that capacity by adding
more equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Crystals, which is looking to expand its refining
capacity, made an unsuccessful bid for a Georgia refinery last year
and reportedly is close to reaching a deal to buy a refinery in
Yonkers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the situation say the Belle Glade-based
Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida, made up of smaller sugar
farmers, is joining Florida Crystals in its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side will comment on the deal, though industry analysts
say it's common knowledge the parties are talking.
</P>
<P>
   Word travels quickly in the sugar industry _ that's why U.S.
Sugar was so keen to keep its refining plans quiet.
</P>
<P>
   From the company's perspective, if any of the refiners who buy
its raw product caught wind of its plans to get into the refining
business too early in the game, it might be bad for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset, it was very closely held,'' recalled Don
Griffin, manager of specialty sugar, who joined Brinson in his
globe-trotting quest for refining knowledge. ``There were some in
the executive suite that didn't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But by early last year _ six months after the company picked
project engineer Stone &AMP; Webster Engineering Corp. of Boston and
about the time the board OK'd the project _ all of Clewiston and
most of the sugar industry knew what U.S. Sugar had cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in March 1997 and wrapped up 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Pest control at the plant
</P>
<P>
   While the company at one point predicted a July completion, El
Nino rains and construction delays pushed that back to September.
By October, the plant was ready for its grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   As a food-grade plant, the refinery must be in tiptop shape at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   Large users of refined sugar have inspected the plant in recent
weeks. Nabisco, Pillsbury and Wrigley came through last month;
Nestle stopped by early this month.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Baking helped in the plant's design
and conducted a three-day inspection _ poring over pest-control
records and probing into corners _ before certifying the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   The institute will inspect the facility four times a year _ at
about $4,000 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pests away, U.S. Sugar planted 50 traps _ referred to as
``tin cats'' _ that cage rodents inside the refinery. The building
is surrounded outside by more than 100 poison bait stations.
</P>
<P>
   All workers wear hair nets and no tobacco or chewing gum is
allowed in the building _ not even inside employees' pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three months, the company even uprooted and
replanted in other areas about 80 trees from around the refinery in
an attempt to keep birds away. That trick was learned from touring
a bird-plagued cake factory in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now dealing with a product that goes on people's
tables,'' Brinson said. ``There are a lot of things that weren't in
our culture that are now.''

 &HT;    Movies definitely aren't what they used to be
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Movies were killer simple when I was a kid.
There were two
</P>
<P>
   plots: ``Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets
her back again''
</P>
<P>
   (my favorite), and ``Good guys always win'' (usually starring
John Wayne). My
</P>
<P>
   playmates and I lived what we watched.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday matinees stoked the fires of our imaginations for an
entire week. I
</P>
<P>
   daydreamed of Pepe le Moko (Charles Boyer) foolishly abandoning
his sanctuary
</P>
<P>
   in the Casbah for the love of a beautiful woman (me). And when
Roy Rogers astride his trusty Trigger galloped across the screen in
search of a damsel in
</P>
<P>
   distress, I knew what nobody else in that darkened theater knew
- Roy wasn't
</P>
<P>
   looking for Dale - he was looking for me (the skinny kid in the
front row with a box of half-melted Milk Duds clutched in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   The only psychological mindbender I remember on the double bill
at the
</P>
<P>
   neighborhood theater was ``Gaslight,'' another Boyer film. In
this one he was the
</P>
<P>
   bad guy trying to scare Ingrid Bergman out of her mind (and her
money) by
</P>
<P>
   messing with the light fixtures. For weeks I listened for
footsteps in the attic and stared at my bedside lamp for a telltale
flicker.
</P>
<P>
   Monster movies intrigued us. We watched ``Frankenstein'' through
our fingers,
</P>
<P>
   squeezing them tightly together during the really scary parts.
Later, when
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and Costello met Frankenstein, we were older and a little
braver. We
</P>
<P>
   didn't hide behind our hands, but on our walk home at dusk, we
gave wide berth
</P>
<P>
   to garages, hedges, and tall bushes. And when we played
``Frankenstein'' nobody
</P>
<P>
   wanted to be the victim.
</P>
<P>
   We loved the John Wayne war movies. After ``Flying Tigers'' we
all wanted to be
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne. For days we made strafing runs on my back yard
sandbox. Once in a
</P>
<P>
   while, one of us would get shot down but one way or another, we
always made it
</P>
<P>
   back to base. One time, in the heat of battle, Tootie yelled,
``Damn it! I've been hit!'' which brought the game to a screeching
halt. We told her John Wayne didn't talk that way and she couldn't
play if she was going to swear. Dialogue in those days was
different. Every fifth word did not begin with ``F'' and end with a
slur on somebody's mother. Heck, things were so tight back then,
even Blondie and Dagwood slept in twin beds. Made sense to us. We
didn't know where Cookie and Baby Dumpling came from anyway.
</P>
<P>
   We all wanted to swim like Esther Williams and emerge from the
depths of a
</P>
<P>
   crystalline pool with every hair in place and droplets of water
clinging to our
</P>
<P>
   ruby lips. We practiced in the back yard sprinkler, prancing
around like lame
</P>
<P>
   swans, while our mothers yelled at us to stay on the grass so we
wouldn't catch
</P>
<P>
   infantile paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to purr like Veronica Lake when she looked into Alan
Ladd's eyes. We didn't know he was standing on a box in the
closeups. It wouldn't have made
</P>
<P>
   any difference anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For days after we watched Greer Garson as ``Mrs. Miniver''
weathering the WW2
</P>
<P>
   blitz without ever losing her cool OR her impeccable manners, we
were so gracious around the house that even our mothers commented
on the change in our
</P>
<P>
   demeanor. Mine thought I'd been up to something, and Tootie's
thought she had a
</P>
<P>
   fever.
</P>
<P>
   Movies were our inspiration back then, and movie stars our role
models. Nothing affected our behavior like those larger-than-life
folks with whom we
</P>
<P>
   spent Saturday afternoons in the dark. Movies taught us how to
act. Luckily, they were pretty innocuous. Good guys were invariably
handsome, brave, and honest. Girls were smart, strong, warm and
loving. Killer simple, just like I said.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie bunch around my neighborhood grew up, so did the
movies. We went from Gable's ``Frankly my dear, I don't give a
damn,'' to Monroe's skirt over
</P>
<P>
   her head in ``The Seven Year Itch,'' and thought it was all too
cool for words. But
</P>
<P>
   over the years we've found ourselves lamenting the scarcity of
flicks that inspire us to drop a day's pay at the Bijou much less
act out the main characters. Tootie says we're jaded. Mary Ann says
we're just fed up with trash. Either way, we're not having as much
fun as we used to.
</P>
<P>
   These days we watch a lot of reruns. Tootie and I are stuck
somewhere between
</P>
<P>
   Cher's ``Loretta'' in ``Moonstruck'' and Annette Bening's savvy
babe in ``The
</P>
<P>
   American President.'' Mary Ann's happy with 'Sleepless in
Seattle,' hoping a
</P>
<P>
   slightly older version of Tom Hanks might be listening in.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Hollywood to wake up and smell the popcorn. Or
haven't they
</P>
<P>
   read the statistics. Our generation is better educated and
living longer than
</P>
<P>
   ever before - and (this is the biggie) - we've got most of the
money. Trouble
</P>
<P>
   is, we're not going to spend it on junk.

 &HT;    MONEYTALK: Roth IRA is useful tool for many people, not all
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Individual retirement accounts _ particularly Roth IRAs _ are a
rich source of both tax breaks and confusion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the choices you may need to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Contributing to a Roth IRA rather than to a traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Converting an existing IRA into a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switching your converted money out of a Roth and back into a
traditional IRA _ then switching it right back again. Strange as it
sounds, that could save you some taxes if you converted before the
market stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRAs are a wonderful retirement savings vehicle. Like
traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs allow individuals to put away as much
as $2,000 a year in tax-favored investments.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional IRAs are attractive in part because they yield an
immediate tax benefit. You can deduct the amount of your
contribution from taxable income, assuming you meet certain
qualifications. And you can defer taxes on the money your
investments earn. You pay when you withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA, by contrast, offers no deduction now. But your
withdrawals are tax-free when you take the money out, if you keep
the account for at least five years and are older than age 59 1/2.
That means your payout can be much, much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts recommend the Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate
to be the same or higher when you take the money out.
</P>
<P>
   The law also allows individuals to convert an existing IRA to a
Roth. You can make the switch if your adjusted gross income is less
than $100,000. You must do it by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch: Technically, you take the money out of the
traditional IRA and, in a separate transaction, put it into the
Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   When you take the first step, the money becomes income. You must
pay taxes on it. In return, you get that potentially huge benefit
of tax-free withdrawals later on.
</P>
<P>
   You can get some relief if you make the transaction by the end
of this year. The IRS will allow you to spread the income over four
years, thus spreading out the tax liability over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can, 1998 is the year to do it, because you have the
advantage of that four-year spread,'' said Roger W. Lusby III, a
certified public accountant with Frazier &AMP; Deeter.
</P>
<P>
   But is the trade-off worth it?
</P>
<P>
   The experts say conversion is the best choice if:
</P>
<P>
   _ You pay the income tax out of current income, not the money
you withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   _ You expect your tax rate to remain the same, or go up, when
you retire.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find the dollars-and-cents impact of conversion
in your circumstances, you can find a first-rate, interactive
worksheet at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .vanguard.com/cgi-bin
</P>
<P>
   /RothConv.
</P>
<P>
   The third choice (switching your converted money out of a Roth
and back into a traditional IRA _ then switching it back again) may
be useful if you converted from a traditional to a Roth IRA earlier
this year, and the value of those investments has declined
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that you created taxable income when you took money out
of your traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that your investments are worth a lot
less now. But you still owe taxes based on the higher values that
existed on the day of your withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   You can reduce that tax liability by moving the Roth money back
to a traditional IRA, then turning around and putting it right back
into a Roth. Suppose you converted a $200,000 portfolio earlier
this year, and the value of that portfolio has since fallen to
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   You now owe taxes on $200,000 in income. But if you do this IRS
two-step, moving a $100,000 portfolio back and forth, your taxable
value on the same portfolio drops to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has approved this gambit, but you can do it only once.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worthwhile?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only generalization is the higher your tax bracket, the
more likely it is that you will want to examine this possibility,''
said Christine Fahlund, a certified financial planner with T. Rowe
Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, it's more a subjective, personal value judgment as
to what is a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you converted $6,000 and now your stock is worth
$5,500, ``is it worth going back and forth?'' asked Lusby.
``Probably not, but that's a decision for the taxpayer.''

 &HT;    On-line auction can offer thrills of real-life bidding
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're near a personal computer,
you're within arm's reach of America's biggest garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people who just don't have enough stuff and don't
want to leave home to get more have made on-line auction site eBay
the Internet's latest why-didn't-I-think-of-that phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A computer programmer whose girlfriend wanted to find other Pez
dispenser collectors started eBay three years ago, and it has grown
from 340,000 registered users to 1.27 million during the past 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based company's stock, offered for the first time
in September, zoomed from $18 to $218 in two months, and founder
Pierre Omidyar's stake approached $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is powerful but simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's junk is another man's treasure,'' said Jennifer Chu,
eBay's associate public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a million items for sale, eBay is the World Wide
Web's version of a vast, tin-roofed flea market, at
http://www.ebay.com. Sellers, all independent of eBay, post nearly
100,000 new items daily _ new to eBay, but mostly more thrift store
than Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   Just a sampling of what you could buy (or try to) on eBay: an
old dental extractor ($205), a burp gun that shoots pingpong balls
($13), a rotary valve tuba ($510), a 1988 Ferrari ($62,800).
</P>
<P>
   Plus, of course, loads of Beanie Babies, Furbys and other hot
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar figures are bids, not prices, and they're followed by the
time remaining until the auction ends. It may be days, hours or
less.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart pounds when you discover that someone is offering
a bronze bust of Liberace like the one Mom loved, it may pound even
harder when you realize you have 12 minutes to decide whether you
really want it in your living room.
</P>
<P>
   Feverish pace attracts bidders
</P>
<P>
   Even if you do, you might lose out to someone who wants it more.
The fever of the bidding is one of eBay's main attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thrill of it,'' Chu said. ``It's so exciting to bid
and so frustrating when you don't get an item.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the thrill of the unknown. On-line auctions are gauzy
bazaars where bidders can't touch the merchandise and may find the
seller identified only by nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties were underscored recently when a Lake Worth
man became the only person barred for life from doing business on
the Internet. He settled a Federal Trade Commission complaint that
he failed to deliver more than $20,000 in computers that he offered
on eBay and another on-line auction, Up4Sale.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay says risks for buyers are small, it acknowledges the
potential for fraud, warns users to beware and says it makes no
guarantees about goods or the people who hawk them. The service's
users cover a wide range.
</P>
<P>
   ``All walks of life, all income levels,'' Chu said. ``It's not
only a place to buy and sell but to meet other people with similar
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has brought increased competition: Yahoo Auctions
(www.yahoo.com) went on line in September, joining an auction site
of competing search engine Excite (www.excite.com), as well as
dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay has responded by buying out the 50,000-user Up4Sale
(www.up4sale.com) and agreeing to pay America Online $12 million
for a three-year agreement that will make it easier for AOL members
to buy and sell through eBay.
</P>
<P>
   One of eBay's primary distinctions is its person-to-person
nature. Most previous on-line auctions were run by companies
offering products, mostly electronics, directly to buyers. Most of
eBay's sellers are individual entrepreneurs looking to make a few
dollars on things they'd otherwise donate to charity, or looking to
make a lot of dollars on their hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start businesses this way,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found a new way of doing business. Margaret and John
Cantrell have had an antique/collectibles shop on Dixie Highway in
West Palm Beach for seven years, but they haven't opened the doors
much since they started offering their wares on eBay last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's on the computer all day, my husband's taking
pictures, and I'm packing things,'' Margaret Cantrell said. ``We've
sold more on eBay in the last month than we have in the past year
at the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cantrells have found eBay perfect for the small items they
specialize in: jewelry, pottery, vintage clothing. They've found
eBay buyers in Sweden, Italy and Monaco, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Renault is also impressed with the international reach eBay
has given him from Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold an American watch to a guy in Taiwan,'' Renault said.
``And I just sold a one-armed, one-legged doll to a guy in
Australia for $860. That's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault, who runs Robert Renault Estate Liquidators, is a
computer fan who found eBay about a year ago while searching other
on-line auction sites. He now lists about 10 items at a time and
sells about 80 percent of what he lists.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Renault's a regular at local antique fairs, eBay
has become a dependable source of collectibles for his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a slot machine, a Tiffany bowl, dolls for my kids,''
he said. ``You can find anything in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault shoots pictures of everything he offers on eBay with a
digital camera and posts them with the descriptions. He says
everyone he's bought from has described flaws and other important
details properly.
</P>
<P>
   Renault's only complaint is mild: Access to eBay has slowed as
users increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more people have been browsing recently since eBay
started advertising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing eBay is free. So is bidding. All that's needed to make
an offer is to register, which requires an e-mail address that can
be verified by return message. Registered users can post any item
by paying a fee ranging from 25 cents for anything under $10, to $2
for anything $50 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The seller has a choice of auction length: three, five or seven
days. As bids come in, the posted dollar figure rises and the
seller is updated regularly by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   High bid binding
</P>
<P>
   Sellers are encouraged to start with their lowest acceptable
price, but it's not mandatory and some find that an artificially
low listing draws more bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The final, high bid is binding on the buyer, although some
occasionally back out. The seller is required to pay eBay a second
fee of up to 5 percent of the high bid (but only 1.5 percent on
bids over $1,000) _ even if the seller decides he can't part with
Uncle Jerry's toupee after all.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other rules, conditions and variations (such as
Dutch auctions for multiple-but-identical items), but it never gets
complicated enough to require a degree in either business or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the profusion of obscure items, eBay boasts a high
success rate. ``A conservative estimate is that 70 percent of the
items listed result in a sale,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for some items is so intense that several companies
offer software that can program a bidder's computer to dial in with
an offer moments before an auction's close. Such software isn't
condoned by eBay, but it's also not outlawed as long as the bidder
follows all the rules, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is sensitive to the possibility of bid
manipulation and forbids practices such as shilling, in which a
seller enlists a friend to help drive up the price with phantom
bids. It has a team that investigates complaints and has revoked
the registration of users who break the rules, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also investigates complaints about merchandise and
sellers and revokes privileges when warranted, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at
the time of the stock offering, eBay noted that its success depends
on sellers describing items accurately and delivering them
reliably. But eBay takes no responsibility for either.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC filings acknowledged that the company has received
complaints from sellers and buyers. They also noted that a state
attorney general's office had received complaints that the company
did not provide adequate warning that it doesn't guarantee
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it believed its disclosures were adequate. The
Florida Attorney General's Office has taken no action against any
on-line auction company, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although bidders don't get a guarantee, they do get plenty of
advice on how to protect themselves. And eBay offers several
features to help, including feedback ratings and notices about
sellers based on past buyers' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Feedback feature effective
</P>
<P>
   The feedback feature is effective, said local user Renault.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants negative feedback,'' he said. ``If a dealer sees
negative feedback, he won't buy from you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are encouraged to e-mail the seller with questions before
bidding and to ask for a phone number. Escrow agents will act as
intermediaries for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most people are good, but there are always a few bad
apples,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the company lists protection tips from the National
Consumers League's Internet Fraud Watch, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Grant, fraud watch director, said on-line auctions account
for 65 percent of the more than 5,500 complaints the nonprofit
organization has received about Internet businesses this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the different categories of Internet fraud we track,
on-line auctions are number one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of complaints is small compared to the number of
users and is spread across various auction sites. Grant warned of
several common pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know who you're dealing with and where they are
physically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're sure, it may be difficult to pursue a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   While individual sellers actually may be operating businesses,
that can be hard to prove long-distance. Grant also warned that a
seller can plant positive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   But many regular bidders and sellers get to know each other,
particularly those with special collecting interests.
</P>
<P>
   There are eBay chat areas for people who collect just about
anything, and eBay recently began offering users free Web pages to
tell more about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of people who have had happy on-line
transactions,'' Grant said. ``I do think you have to be cautious.
It's nothing to hurtle into blindly.''

 &HT;    For the love of Mildred: Radio listeners reach out to help
longtime caller
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The phone lines at WZZR-FM's lunchtime
Love Doctors show are full with bozos and potty-mouth quipsters.
But they'll have to wait. Mildred Malmsteen is calling.
</P>
<P>
   During the six years she's been phoning the show, the
67-year-old mother of six from Port Salerno has become a surrogate
radio grandma to listeners who know her only as ``Mildred.''
</P>
<P>
   This day, show hosts Rich Dickerson and Glenn Curtis decide to
toy around and quiz her on history. As usual, Mildred's a little
fuzzy on the facts. But with her Gracie Allen charm and Minnie
Pearl know-it-all style, she gives it a whirl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know about the journey of Christopher Columbus to the
New World, Mildred?'' Curtis asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, what was America like in those days?'' Dickerson begs,
suppressing a giggle. From his voice, you can tell, this is gonna
be a funny one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there was Indiannnnnnns,'' Mildred says in a sing-song
Michigan twang. ``And they had a big feeeeeeeeast.'' With her
accent, the word feast comes out as a four-syllable noun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah? What did they eat?'' Dickerson asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn meal ... Oh, and corn pudding ... '' she says
authoritatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ewwwwwww!'' Curtis groans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn mush ... roast corn ... corn meal ... corn mush ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson and Curtis bust a gut laughing. Mildred plays it
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're saying that Columbus had the first Thanksgiving
dinner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe to say that as part of the show's regular cast of twisted
callers, Malmsteen's natural charm stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why, when she was absent from the airwaves for
several months this summer, listeners were alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone called and asked, `Hey, where's Mildred been?'''
Dickerson said. ``I didn't want to say anything. It's her business,
but I had to tell them she was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Struck with fever, weakness and excessive weight gain, she went
to the hospital in July and was diagnosed with advanced ovarian
cancer. Doctors tried to perform a hysterectomy but closed her up
without removing a cancerous mass almost a foot wide. She began
chemotherapy in August, but chances of her surviving longer than a
year were slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors said I shoulda had this taken care of 20 years
ago, but I didn't even know I had it back then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After Dickerson announced the diagnosis on the air, the
station's lines lit up with offers to help. One caller pledged
money to send her granddaughter to private school through eighth
grade. Dozens of listeners dropped by her room at Martin Memorial
Hospital, asking simply to see ``Mildred.'' The radio station
channeled thousands of dollars in donations to a medical fund in
her name.
</P>
<P>
   With no insurance and little money _ she collected aluminum cans
and copper scrap to pay her taxes, buy food and purchase Christmas
presents for her family _ Malmsteen had no way to pay for medical
care, much less make herself more comfortable. She lives with her
son and daughter-in-law at their house just off Salerno Road
because the doctor won't let her live alone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But she'll be done with her chemotherapy in a few months. And
when word went out that she wanted to fix up the home she had lived
in since 1962, contractor John Young dropped by the Port Salerno
house.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a ramshackle building he pronounced ``just not
livable.'' There was no air-conditioning, exposed wires hung from
ceiling beams, the windows were boarded, and the yard was overgrown
with weeds and debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked her in the eyes and said, `I'm going to build you a
new home,''' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen other contractors joined his effort, pledging
everything from architectural plans to help with getting permits.
Martin County firefighters will soon destroy the existing home in a
practice burn so that construction on the new house can begin in
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Young) is a man with a big heart,'' Mildred said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, along with the promise of a new home, Mildred has other
good news: Her tumor is shrinking. She thinks it's because a
guardian angel _ whom she swears she saw in the middle of the night
at her hospital bed in August _ told her she'd get better. Whether
she'll live to set foot in the new home is another matter, but she
doesn't dwell on the prognosis. The chemotherapy has stolen her
shoulder-length brown hair, but not her sense of humor or her
positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a purpose for me to be here,'' she said. ``God put me
here for a reason. If not, I'd have been dead a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations in Malmsteen's name can be made at any NationsBank
branch in Martin and St. Lucie counties. Checks must be payable to
the ``Mildred Benefit Fund.''

 &HT;    Wildlife officials gear up for busy, short deer season
 &HT;    By Jim Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kevin Behr stepped out of his car, his ears tuned
to every sound.
</P>
<P>
   Behr, the Warren County wildlife officer, slowly approached the
pick-up truck from the rear on the driver's side. He saw a dead
deer, a small buck, sprawled across the tailgate. But the clicking
sounds held his interest.
</P>
<P>
   In a few seconds, a man appeared from the driver's side. Behr
offered a friendly greeting, even though he knew he would end up
citing the man _ a $143 fine _ for a safety violation.
</P>
<P>
   Behr and every other wildlife officer in Ohio had their busiest
day of the year Monday, the first day of Ohio's deer gun hunting
season. The season, which might draw half a million hunters
statewide, ends Saturday in all parts of Ohio except the
southeastern portion, which gets one extra day, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be this way all week,'' Behr said. ``You start before
the sun comes up and you don't finish until after 10 at night. You
just have to expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, wildlife officers were inundated with trespassing
complaints during the deer gun season. This year, however, stiffer
fines for hunting without permission are likely to result in fewer
calls to catch trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes of each other Monday morning Behr ran into
safety violations _ carrying loaded weapons. Checking hunter safety
is a big part of an officer's patrol during deer gun season.
</P>
<P>
   When he approached the pick-up truck, the clicking sounds came
as two passengers quickly ejected shells from their shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you know there is a law against carrying loaded weapons
in a vehicle, because as soon as you saw me coming, I heard them
unloading,'' Behr told the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell people that breaking the law just isn't worth
it,'' Behr said. ``Sure, the monetary loss can be substantial, but
even more important is the chance for loss of life or serious
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after leaving those hunters, Behr came across a
young man walking alone along the side of a road, carrying a
shotgun in a case. That looked innocent enough, but when Behr
checked the gun, he found a shell in the chamber. He issued the
youngster a warning with hopes he will be more careful in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying a loaded gun like that can be dangerous any time,''
Behr said. ``You can trip and fall and the gun can go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters can take only one deer this year in most parts of
western Ohio. But there's an exception: In the state's four urban
zones, hunters can take up to six deer. Those zones cover the
eastern edge of Montgomery County, the western side of Warren
County, the eastern side of Butler County and all of Hamilton and
Clermont counties.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's 1998 estimated deer population is lower across the state
than in recent years _ between 400,000 and 425,000 compared with
500,00 in 1996. But many deer have been concentrated around the
state's largest cities, mostly because hunting is not allowed
within city limits. The urban zones have been established next to
those city boundaries, hoping to thin the deer population where
deer-human conflicts, such as deer-vehicle accidents and damage to
trees are prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   The zones are among efforts nationwide to curtail the deer
population in or near urban centers. Some municipalities offer
permits to hunters that allow them to use bows or shotguns to kill
more female deer. One group is even trying deer contraceptives. And
in one instances, the increasing number of deer had spawned a
business _ a team of sharpshooters will contract with a
municipality to kill deer.
</P>
<P>
   Some city park systems in Ohio have become so inundated with
deer that they've put on controlled hunts to reduce the herd. Two
such hunts are planned for suburban Cleveland parks this week,
which has drawn protests from animal rights groups. Similar
problems have cropped up in other cities across the nation. In
Minneapolis suburbs, teams of sharpshooters, using night vision
equipment, have been hired to take out 150 deer.
</P>
<P>
   The Five Rivers MetroParks system, around Dayton, has not had an
overpopulation of deer and hasn't had to put on controlled hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Warren County there has been a great deal of development in
recent years,'' Behr observed. ``People are moving into areas that
once were woods and fields. They're finding the deer are still
around, and that sometimes causes problems.''

 &HT;    Ghost of seasons past said to roam at WSB
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't adjust your TV set. That shadow on your screen
just might be the ghost of a Civil War soldier _ miffed at
Atlanta's ABC affilliate, WSB-TV, for building its new studios
atop, or near, trenches used in the Battle of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost, dubbed ``the General'' by bemused WSB staffers, is
said to have rattled everything but chains since the station moved
into its $50 million building on West Peachtree Street in June.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Patton, who works in the accounting department, points
toward an empty cubicle down a long hall. ``He lives back there,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noises come from empty spaces. There is . . . this feeling
someone is here. Then you hear things. Things moving. That's why we
keep that door closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eve Whitaker, a sales executive, says she had a close encounter
while working alone one night. ``Something came up behind me and
flipped my hair, playfully. I turned around and there was nothing,
only this feeling of a presence,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the alleged haunting by an employee, a team of
self-styled ghost hunters has checked out the building. Not only
did the haint register on their electromagnetic and thermal
sensors, but an image said to look like a cap-wearing young soldier
showed up in a photo.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost hunters were led by Cheri Mohr Drake of the 70-member
Georgia Haunt Hunt Team, which investigates reports of ghosts
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Drake says people can feel the presence of ghosts and measure
them with instruments, but they appear only on photos. At WSB, when
she got sensor readings, she and another team member snapped
pictures furiously, capturing the supposed face, some ``orbs'' and
a beam of light _ all displayed on their Web site,
http://www.geocities.com/(tilde)gahaunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds crazy, but many WSB staffers, from receptionists to
reporters and even executives, say they're convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night there was nobody here. No machines were on,'' says
Florence Hatcher, who works in human resources. ``I heard furniture
rolling across the floor, papers shuffling. He was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stone, an executive producer, concedes she's haunted by
the photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look and say, `That's something.' It has on one of those
Civil War caps. You know, you have a powerful reason to believe in
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tale's credibility is the building's location _ at
a Civil War battlefield. ``We were built on the Confederate
trenches, you know,'' says Hatcher. ``Our thinking is, he was
disturbed with all the digging that was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   WSB's top managers seem amused, though doubtful, about the
ghost. ``I'll believe it when he comes up to me and shakes my
hand,'' declares operations manager David Lamothe.
</P>
<P>
   But the brass maintains the story about Civil War fortifications
is off-base. ``We didn't see any signs of trenches,'' says Lamothe.
``It's true there were trenches nearby, fighting here, a big battle
down at Peachtree Creek. We told everyone if they found anything to
let me know, and nobody did.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who've studied the war in Atlanta are less sure that WSB
avoided the fortifications. Franklin Garrett, 92, Atlanta's
unofficial official historian, is positive the new WSB studios were
erected on the trenches. Standing on mud churned by bulldozers
still working on the WSB site, Garrett points behind a row of
portable toilets: ``That's about where they were. That was about
the center of the outer Confederate lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Many WSB staffers have bought into the story. Janie Pope, a
secretary in the accounting department, says the General was never
heard at WSB's old building, known as White Columns. ``He must have
been aroused by something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And, Hatcher sniffs, who cares what the doubters say?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can believe what they want,'' she says. ``He looks like a
private in the pictures, but we promoted him to general. It never
hurts to be on the good side of a ghost.''

 &HT;    Charmed by a prince, Von Furstenberg married him
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ She's slouched way down like a kid bored in
class, nearly sliding right onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   This plopped-on-the-sofa posture is surprisingly bourgeois for
Diane Von Furstenberg _ princess, world traveler, '70s wrap-dress
creator and bearer of one of the most recognized names on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   This is her very last chat _ done, kaput, finito _ on a wearying
two-week jaunt to promote her autobiography Diane: A Signature
Life, released this month. And she's been back to her hotel just
long enough to change into a white cotton Jil Sander shirt (``it's
tailored like a man's, but it's cut for a woman'') and Romeo Gigli
striped leggings. She wears a large, rectangular diamond on her
right hand. (``I like it,'' she jokes, ``because it looks like
Barbie's ring.'') And there are still little round dents on her
earlobes, a telltale sign of clip earrings just removed. Ahhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   She resembles one of those Palm Beachers you see at the green
market downtown on Saturday mornings _ untucked, not much makeup or
jewelry, but still something that whispers rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did three television interviews this morning, and then I
spoke at the Miami Book Fair _ a big crowd, about 400 people,'' she
says, fiddling with the cap from her Aquafina water bottle. ``So,
yes, I've done the dog-and-pony show.''
</P>
<P>
   The author yawns, then sits up straight. Time to focus.
</P>
<P>
   We're in The Marlin lobby, all stainless steel and South Beach
slick. The silver sofas have big rubber wheels that look as if
they've been swiped from an industrial cart. (The hotel is owned by
her buddy Chris Blackwell, who founded Island Records _ as in U2
and Bob Marley. DVF, you see, knows everybody.)
</P>
<P>
   She says the book is more business memoir than autobiography.
But A Signature Life provides enough dish that even daughter
Tatiana found it revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to be inspiring for women,'' Von Furstenberg says.
``Besides, the heroine is my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg's mom, Lily Halfin, is a Holocaust survivor who
gave birth to her only daughter in 1947, just 18 months after being
freed from a concentration camp. Her dad, Leon Halfin, spent the
war in Switzerland and married his wife in Belgium, where he
prospered in electronics. Six years later, the couple had a son,
Philippe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My childhood was perfectly happy, but I didn't particularly
enjoy being a child,'' recalls Von Furstenberg, 51. ``I never
played with toys or dolls, and I loved when people thought I was
older than I really was.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   She pauses. ``Yes, I think I would still consider it a
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   But this grandma-to-be (her daughter-in-law, the jet-set
Alexandra Miller, is due in the spring) is nobody's bootie knitter.
Even in the sunlight, which can be unforgiving, Von Furstenberg
looks regal. Her fingernails are short and natural, but her
toenails are bright red. Plenty of spunk remains.
</P>
<P>
   In short, here's how Von Furstenberg nailed a prince and landed
in the States:
</P>
<P>
   Splits Brussels at 13 for boarding schools in Switzerland and
England.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, studies economics at the University of Geneva,
where she meets European aristocrat Prince Eduard Egon von und zu
Furstenberg at a nightclub. Isn't enthralled at first, but finds
herself attracted to his ``helplessness'' when their car gets stuck
in the snow. (``I love vulnerability in men.'')
</P>
<P>
   Egon heads to New York for training at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Her mom gives her a plane ticket to visit him in America on her
21st birthday, and Egon introduces the slim brunette to fashion
dominatrix and Vogue editor Diana Vreeland.
</P>
<P>
   The couple marry July 1969 in Paris, DVF three months pregnant.
Lily Halfin ``liked Egon very much.'' Egon's German relatives,
however, were outraged. His father attended the wedding but ditched
the reception. (Later, with her logo attached to more than $1
billion worth of merchandise, his family grew to accept her as
``the smart Jew,'' Von Furstenberg has said.)
</P>
<P>
   They return to New York, and their first child, Alexandre, is
born six months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I was an inexperienced young girl, I was also a
European princess and embraced by the city,'' Von Furstenberg
recalls. ``It opened doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Tatiana, came along in 1970, and just two years
later, the Von Furstenbergs were on the cover of Town &AMP; Country as
``the couple who conquered New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But DVF literally made a name for herself after showing Vreeland
a few dress designs she'd been peddling around town in a suitcase.
One was a snug jersey knit deal that wrapped and tied on the side.
Conservative yet sexy. And perfect on just about any figure.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wrap dress'' would become the defining frock of the
decade, worn by suburban matrons, socialites and secretaries alike.
</P>
<P>
   (Trivia: She planned to call her fashion company Diane
Furstenberg, but jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a friend of
Egon's, said the Von added ``so much.'')
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, 1976, the cover of Newsweek featured a victorious,
wrap-dressed Von Furstenberg _ hands on her hips.
</P>
<P>
   And she hadn't even hit 30.
</P>
<P>
   Enough names, enough dates. What are the trappings of a charmed
life? What lipstick, for instance, does she wear?
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg is amazingly accommodating, spilling her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Out falls a silver tube of MAC ``3-D.'' A Swiss Army knife
``that I never use,'' she says (although she carried a switchblade
in her early New York years ``that I only peeled apples with'').
Some keys, one of them a Medeco you can't duplicate without an act
of Congress. A wallet with the corner of a $50 bill sticking out. A
cell phone. Sunglasses. And two Pilot Varsity disposable fountain
pens in black.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just the most marvelous pens,'' gushes the gal with
a signature known 'round the globe. ``Here, try it. The ink just
flows. I love how it just flows. But once you're finished, you can
throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please keep it,'' she says, refusing to take it back. ``Of
course you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrap-dress rage faded in the late '70s, and not long after,
Von Furstenberg's label disintegrated into a handful of cheap
licensees (luggage, eye wear, kids' clothes and such).
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, she begged Wal-Mart for a chance to revive her brand,
but no dice. They considered her a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time, divorce from Egon became final after years
of separation. (She dedicates the book to her ex, though, ``who
gave me the children and the name.'') The prowling princess dated
Richard Gere, Ryan O'Neal, ``countless men who appeared on the
cover of Rolling Stone,'' she says, and even a college kid named
L.J. who's mentioned in her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in love,'' she says, pulling her legs under her
on the sofa. ``But to be honest, I'm afraid of really being
committed. I hate to admit this, but I fear rejection. I change
myself with every man.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children tease me. They say that I have no personality
because I'm different depending on whom I'm with.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Brazilian Paulo Fernandes, a dealer of primitive art who
lived in a bamboo beach house. She joined him in Bali and wore
cotton sarongs for 4 1/2 years. Then, in 1984, came Italian writer
Alain Elkann. She joined him in Paris and wore tweed skirts for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a leopard-print hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she flew back and forth to New York dabbling in
couture, cologne, cosmetics, you name it. Nothing really soared,
and her heart wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one constant: media mogul Barry Diller, now 56,
whom she met at a Hollywood party when she was 28. Currently the
chairman of USA Networks, he's the guy who put Fox on the map; gave
QVC its clout (including Von Furstenberg's Silk Assets line); and
is now in control of Home Shopping Network (on which DVF hawks a
private-label brand).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're intimate, we're in each other's lives, we're like
family,'' she says of their no-strings-attached amour. ``We still
may marry, who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovers, friends. Sometimes both, but always one or the other. He
adores her, period.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to hail the end of her book tour, Diller's whisking her
away on his boat for five days.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Von Furstenberg grabbed the coattails of '70s
nostalgia and relaunched her wrap dress with a smaller, more
rounded collar and shorter length. The updated version flew off the
racks at Saks and onto the likes of Claudia Schiffer, Gwyneth
Paltrow ``and other young, hip women,'' the designer says with
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in her new Diane line _ exclusively for specialty
stores _ are sporty knit separates.
</P>
<P>
   She refers to her brand as her ``third child,'' and you sense
she's at peace. At long last, she again owns her name.
</P>
<P>
   She recently opened her design firm, Diane Von Furstenberg
Studio, in a 15,000-square-foot, 19th-century building in New
York's West Village.
</P>
<P>
   Vie boheme!
</P>
<P>
   Children, Alexandre, 28, and Tatiana, 27, are doing well, too.
Her son, who married Alexandra Miller in 1995, is a New York
financier, and Tatiana's an L.A.-based writer and foster mom.
(Alexandra, by the way, is creative director of Von Furstenberg's
new venture.)
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my life, I'm seeking coherence,'' the
designer says, brushing back her shoulder-length hair with her
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want everything to reflect who I am and to be in order
_ the books I read, the food I eat, the decors I live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is, Diane Von Furstenberg bounces back like one of
those blow-up punching toys. Again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she's been well-connected along the way. But the decisions
have always been hers. Freedom, she says, is what she prizes most.
That and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg stands up, slings her purse over her shoulder
and says she needs to take a walk.
</P>
<P>
   All by herself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she replies, heading out onto the South Beach
sidewalk. ``That's how I prefer to do everything.''

HYDE STILL SEEKS 
 TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR DEC. 1. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Impeachment politics dominate, with the House Judiciary
Committee's decision to expand its inquiry into President Clinton's
fund-raising activities leading at USA Today, the Los Angeles Times
and New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post goes instead with Tuesday's announcement
that Exxon and Mobil will indeed merge.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary will probably, the papers report, vote on party lines
to issue subpoenas today bearing on prior Dept. of Justice
investigations into Clinton's 1996 fund-raising. FBI Director Louis
Freeh and Charles LaBella, former head of DOJ's fund-raising
investigation, will probably be ordered to testify, and their
superior, Janet Reno, will be ordered to turn over memos they wrote
to her. Another subpoena will probably go to Clinton himself,
requiring that he ensure that Reno comply with the committee's
request.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT plays the Clinton subpoena high, putting it in the
headline and in the first sentence. The NYT also plays it high.
USAT is a bit more offhand, mentioning the subpoena of the memos
and of Freeh in the subhead, but holding off until halfway through
the story before placing the president's subpoena third in a list
of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT notes that previously, separate House and Senate
committees investigated Clinton fund-raising without uncovering
illegality by high-level Clinton administration officials, but goes
on to quote a Judiciary Republican source saying that only 20
percent of LaBella's memo has been reviewed by Congress, and that
the GOP members believe the other 80 percent contains strong
evidence of illegal Clinton fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The papers all report that despite Clinton's being invited by
Henry Hyde to appear before the committee, his spokesman Monday
said he won't be coming. The NYT quotes presidential press
secretary Joe Lockhart saying of any appearance by his boss that
``It won't add any new information and can be put in the category
of a stunt.'' But the LAT says Lockhart made this comment not about
Clinton, but about Judiciary's plan to take testimony Tuesday from
two convicted perjurers.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT lead lays out the political dilemma voting for
impeachment instead of censure presents to House Republicans:
Voting for impeachment will probably produce a party line House
vote, which will impair the GOP's ability to work with Democrats on
other issues. And will make censure, which is more likely than
impeachment, look like a Democratic victory.
</P>
<P>
   The WP explains that Exxon's purchase of Mobil will rejoin two
of the biggest pieces of the Standard Oil empire broken up by the
government nine decades ago, and will leave just three corporations
with control of vast oil reserves and tens of thousands of gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Post agrees with the view expressed in a NYT piece Monday
and in the USAT off-lead today: the merger will cost more than
10,000 jobs (USAT says it could be 12,000).
</P>
<P>
   The LAT's Column One tells of what it calls the abortion
debate's cause celebre, the first murder prosecution of an abortion
doctor in California in nearly 20 years. Dr. Bruce Steir is charged
with knowing that he botched an abortion but failing to have his
patient admitted to a hospital. Later that day, during the long
drive back to her home, the woman died. Given that the California
Medical Association found no basis for criminal charges, the
association and many pro-choice advocates fear the case is an
example of what may well become the newest weapon against doctors
who provide abortions: selective criminal prosecution. (One
quibble: The piece describes Steir as a ``veteran of 40,000
procedures.'' Why not write that he ``had performed 40,000
abortions''?)
</P>
<P>
   The LAT front reports that new studies show that although AIDS
was slow in coming to South Africa, that country is now the place
on the planet hardest hit by the disease. The infection rate there
is now one new person per minute. But AIDS denial and ignorance in
the country is widespread. In a survey of 1,000 people in the black
township of Soweto, the paper says, 70 percent believed they were
at little or no risk, even though nearly two-thirds said they never
used a condom.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow had a 217-point drop Monday, but the papers keep the
story off the front page. Are the papers getting the point that
spilling a lot of ink over a market going one way so soon after
spilling an equal amount on a market going the other way is more
than a little ridiculous? Today's Papers can only hope--and adds
that papers should also quit announcing the raw point totals of
market moves in headlines. The percentage of the move is much more
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal cites the doubling of Sharper Image
stock on Monday as a symbol of how investor excitement can be
triggered by Internet angles--the company says its web sales have
tripled in the past year. But, the paper reports, web sales only
account for 2 percent of the company's revenue. And this should
indeed sober everybody up fast, because let's face it, have you
ever seen anybody actually buy something in a Sharper Image store?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has gotten a lot of coverage about how he raised ``soft
money'' for the DNC, but a small item Tuesday in the WP's Reliable
Source tells you something about how he spends it. And it's not
exactly saving the planet or reinventing government. The Gore
family holiday photo greeting card was billed to the DNC at a cost
of $110,000.

SODOMY LAW INFRINGES ON PRIVACY SAYS GEORGIA COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Last
week, the Georgia Supreme Court did for its state what the U.S.
Supreme Court would not do for the nation _ it tossed law
enforcement officials out of the bedroom.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court in Bowers vs. Hardwick
upheld the constitutionality of Georgia's law criminalizing sodomy
_ under the high court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.
It was a 5-4 decision that revealed an unsettling peek at the
homophobia of some of the members of the court.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer had entered Michael Hardwick's Atlanta
apartment, looked into the bedroom and found Hardwick having sex
with another male. Hardwick was arrested and charged under the
state's sodomy statute. The law reads, in part: ``a person commits
the offense of sodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act
involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth and anus of
another.''
</P>
<P>
   When the charge was dropped, Hardwick filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the law in federal court _
hoping the U.S. Constitution would protect his right of privacy in
his own bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The law, itself, makes no distinction on whether an act of
sodomy is committed by homosexuals or heterosexuals; it's still a
felony. Presumably, a husband and wife could have been charged
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's high court, in a decision written by Justice Byron
White, states that no right of privacy found in the U.S.
Constitution includes ``a fundamental right to engage in homosexual
sodomy.'' Notice that the court's focus is only on homosexual
sodomy. The court makes it clear in a footnote to the decision that
the justices were not ruling on the constitutionality of the
Georgia law as it applies to heterosexual sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Warren Burger, in his concurring opinion, adds:
``To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as
a fundamental right would be to case aside millennia of moral
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the federal Constitution does not explicitly grant a
fundamental right to engage in sodomy _ or any other sex act. The
question that the court should have answered, the real issue behind
the set of facts in that case: Does the federal Constitution
recognize the right of privacy surrounding the most intimate of
human activity, sex between consenting adults?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a lukewarm
concurring opinion that he would later regret. He provided the
crucial fifth vote to uphold the sodomy law. After Powell retired,
he publicly declared that the Hardwick decision was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, on Nov. 23, the Supreme Court of Georgia in
Powell vs. The State corrected the mistake _ for Georgians, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony San Juan Powell was charged with rape and aggravated
sodomy in regard to sexual conduct involving him and his wife's
niece. Powell testified that he had sex with the young woman
including cunnilingus _ with her consent. After Powell's admission,
the judge added the charge of sodomy. The jury acquitted Powell of
rape and aggravated sodomy, believing that the woman had given her
consent, but found him guilty of sodomy. In the sodomy law, consent
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Powell appealed to the state's highest court _ contending that
the law criminalizes acts of sodomy committed by consenting adults
in private and thereby violates the right of privacy guaranteed to
all Georgia citizens by their state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia high court agreed. In a strongly worded 6-1
decision, the court struck down the state's sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was written by Chief Justice Robert Benham. He
notes that ``the right of privacy has a long and distinguished
history in Georgia.'' In 1905, the state's highest court recognized
that Georgia citizens have a ``liberty of privacy'' guaranteed by
Georgia's Bill of Rights. The Georgia Supreme Court, in fact,
recognized privacy rights long before any other state appellate
courts or the U.S. Supreme Court did. And now, according to Benham,
Georgia recognizes that the right of privacy has ``a value so
essential to individual liberty in our society that its
infringement merits careful scrutiny by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, Benham adds: ``Privacy rights protected by the
U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case.'' And thus, he
points out, Bowers vs. Hardwick is not applicable to the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1905 Georgia case, Pavesich vs. New England Life
Insurance, the court found ``the right of privacy to be `ancient
law,' with `its foundations in the instincts of nature ... making
it immutable and absolute.''' This liberty includes ``the right to
live as one will, so long as that will does not interfere with the
rights of another or of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Benham strikes the key issue in the Powell case: ``We cannot
think of any other activity that reasonable persons would rank as
more private and more deserving of protection from governmental
interference than consensual, private, adult sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He closes his argument: ``The only possible purpose for the
((sodomy)) statute is to regulate the private conduct of consenting
adults, the public gains no benefit, and the individual is unduly
oppressed by the invasion of the right to privacy. Consequently, we
must conclude that the legislation exceeds the permissible bounds
of the police power.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan,
dismayed at how the nation's highest court had begun to renege on
individual rights in its reading of the federal Constitution,
called on state courts to ``step into the breach'' and interpret
their own state constitutions more expansively in the service of
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia high court has righted a grievous wrong. Other state
courts should follow its lead _ in the service of freedom.

better educated and living longer than ever before - and (this is
the biggie) - we've got most of the money. Trouble is, we're not
going to spend it on junk movies that don't inspire us. (Schuett,
Cox News Service) MOVED.

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ A buddy and I were riding
around, going nowhere in particular, something we've been doing
since back in high school. ``Last Kiss'' by J. Frank Wilson was
playing on the CD. ``There's not one thing wrong with that song,''
my friend said. Such was our tribute to J. Frank Wilson, someone
we'd known since grade school. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED

   RADIO-HELP _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For years, Mildred _ her
funny Michigan accent and her elderly, sometimes fuzzy recollection
of history _ entertained and engaged listeners in the South Florida
area. One day last summer, a caller wanted to know where Mildred
had been _ she hadn't called the talk show in quite some time.
Mildred had been diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. After the
host of the radio show announced her diagnosis on the air, the
station's lines lit up with offers to help. One caller pledged
money to send Mildred's granddaughter to private school through
eighth grade. Dozens of listeners dropped by her room at Martin
Memorial Hospital, asking to see her. The radio station channeled
thousands of dollars in donations to a medical fund in her name.

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ALIEN-PRISON (San Antonio) _ Bairon Morales-Oliva is behind bars
without bail partly because of what he did _ drive drunk _ and
partly because he was born outside the United States. Officails
want to deport him because of a 1993 felony DWI conviction. A new
federal law requires immigration officials to lock up criminal
aliens while deportation proceedings wind through the system. By
MARO ROBBINS.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-DEATH (San Francisco) _ In what may be the nation's
largest verdict of its kind, a federal jury awarded more than $2.3
million to the family of a convicted murderer who was shot and
killed by a guard in San Quentin, the latest rebuke of the state
prison system's use of deadly force. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   HEPATITIS (Albany, N.Y.) _ A blood test may have saved Lucy's
life. Last year, after a routine physical and blood test, Lucy's
doctor discovered she had elevated liver enzymes. Further tests
showed hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis,
liver cancer and liver failure. Hepatitis C kills an estimated
10,000 people annually and is the leading reason for liver
transplants in this country. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE-BROWN (San Francisco) _ San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
has racked up more than 75,000 international travel miles _ perhaps
more than any of his predecessors and enough to qualify him for one
free round trip in a coach seat to his beloved Paris. By GREGORY
LEWIS.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BIG-DIAPERS (San Antonio) _ More and more children are being
potty trained later in life, according to the firest large-scale
study of toilet training in 30 years. And the $4 billion diaper
industry is responding to _ some might say driving _ that trend,
introducing diapers that are made specifically for the huskier
toddler and the older child who is not ready to start potty
training. By CINDY RAMOS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ A lot of investors want to know how
they can protect themselves against bad advice from stockbrokers.
The stock market watchdogs have come up with a new way to help. By
PAMELA YIP.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   McGEGAN-MUSIC-REVIEW (Houston) _ As music director of San
Francisco's acclaimed Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, conductor
Nicholas McGegan is closely associated with the operas, oratorios
and concertos of the Baroque era. That his experience and musical
sympathies extend far beyond that era has been evident in his
appearances with the Houston Symphony. The latest was a charming
evening of music by Elgar, Haydn and Richard Strauss. By CHARLES
WARD.
</P>
<P>
   LOVETT-MUSIC-REVIEW (Houston) _ The Aerial Theater and the
Anderson Fair folk club are separated by a 10-minute car ride. But
that distance can sum up a career for many musicians. Lyle Lovett,
one of the handful of Houston-based artists to successfully
complete the jump to national touring act, led a full house of new
and old fans back across that great divide at the Aerial. By RICK
MITCHELL.
</P>
<P>
   FUNNYGIRL-THEATER-REVIEW (Houston) _ Every musical contains a
make-or-break moment early on that indicates whether the show will
fly or fall. In ``Funny Girl,'' the classic backstage musical based
on the life of entertainer Fanny Brice, it's the title character's
first song, ``I'm the Greatest Star.'' By EVERETT EVANS.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS-INJURY (San Francisco) _ Ken Norton said he wasn't
sure how Bryant Young fractured his right leg Monday night. He said
he just remembered a collision, and ``a scream I'll never forget.''
It was the kind of scream football players know almost
instinctively, the kind they know can erode their own will to keep
playing this dangerous game if they get too close or stay too long.
By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS-RICE (San Francisco) _ Jerry Rice made a great cutback
move on Monday night. He was wearing a gray flannel suit and a
bright smile when he did it. ``This might be the season I have to
play a different role,'' he said in the locker room after the 49ers
beat the New York Giants, 31-7. ``You've got to swallow deep and
live with it.'' By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Pope John Paul II has issued a
papal bull proclaiming 2000 a Holy Year, and prescribing good works
and penitence to be done that year. The pope also said Catholics
could give up smoking or drinking for a day and obtain an
``indulgence'' to get on the fast track into heaven. Due to the
rigors of being a San Francisco columnist, I've given up drinking
for a day many times _ sincerely, as the bull specifies. Now it
qualifies me for the express line to heaven. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The comment by a lawyer
representing one of two cops accused of beating up a suspect in
handcuffs compared John Dorfman, the special prosecutor in the
case, to Kenneth Starr. Apparently, from now on, whenever a
prosecutor does his job vigorously _ whenever a prosecutor does
anything but roll over and play dead in any criminal case _ he can
expect to be likened to Ken Starr. By DAN LYNCH.

<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the month's other ``unnatural'' figure ought to be
getting easier. Pinochet, after all, has earned the right to be
called the most evil man now alive on earth. (Sorry, Saddam.) The
British law lords have decreed that he is not immune from
extradition. The crucial principle of universal accountability has
thus been upheld. Atrocity is not to be excused by the occupancy of
high office. All this has become very clear in the past days.
</P>
<P>
   Why then has the British Home Secretary asked for extra time to
decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

YOUNG-ADULT READERS NEED BETTER BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago I read in, I believe, Reader's Digest, a critical
article written by, I believe, Clifton Fadiman, titled, I believe,
``The Decline of Attention.'' The decline was in attention to
literature, more specifically toward ``serious'' fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Fadiman or otherwise, was confident that the
impending death of seriously constituted fiction was a myth, and
gave evidence that such rumors had been alive for more than a
century. I was consoled then; but now I believe the decline is
real, has already happened, is near to bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
   When that article appeared, television was with us, but only in
a minority of American homes, and in fewer homes elsewhere.
Television had not taken over our lives, had not gained absolute
dominion over children.
</P>
<P>
   In today's educational environment, children still learn to
read, and there is statistical indication that they read with
better facility than did earlier youth cycles. That's good, of
course, because high literacy is mandatory for progress in the
business and professional pursuits of adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But reading for pleasure? Reading for pleasure and
enlightenment? Reading for artistic appreciation? That's where the
``decline'' is marked so sourly.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me for sounding, inevitably, like one of those
``everything was better in my day'' codgers. But if things weren't
better, they sure were different.
</P>
<P>
   Look out on the streets today, and in front and back yards and
vacant lots. How many children are out playing? In summer, I played
baseball, tossed footballs in autumn, shot baskets the year 'round;
and there always were pick-up games to get into in all sports. I
even got in on the last gasp of marbles as a popular activity for
boys. I was never sure what girls did, apart from the neuterless
games they played with us _ kick-the-can or whatever _ but girls
were outside, too; and when we all went indoors, we all read, and
we read good fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This was a discussion topic among contemporaries at a high
school class reunion. All of us read then; and almost all of us
read today _ for pleasure and enlightenment and artistic
satisfaction _ but now we're the grandparent generation that isn't
``with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet our little grandchildren also read. Picture books have
magnetic pull for them; and secure in their comprehension of the
elementary stories, they enjoy demonstrating their reading skill.
Small children can have their books and television, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when they're older _ no longer small but not yet big _
reading loses out. Adolescents forsake reading for pleasure simply
because there isn't pleasure in sufficient degree. They aren't
regaled, aren't captivated by what they're reading. I can't blame
them.
</P>
<P>
   The failure, I believe, is in what may be termed transitional
literature. Books for children are unmistakable, as are books for
adults. But there is a nebulous in-between; and the dilemma is
compounded by publishers on the one hand, and educators on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Over three professional decades I have monitored the realm of
``young adult'' fiction, sometimes specified for ages 10 to 14, and
occasionally for the 13-to-16 age group. With few exceptions, these
books are insults to juvenile imagination and curiosity. Hardly any
YA titles remain in print very long, or otherwise hold value for
chasing those well-known puberty blues.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescents well-oiled for reading may do much better _ and
experience high adventure _ by going directly to adult fare. It's a
noble challenge for their sophistication. Rather than writing down
to them, we should push them to read ``up'' _ taking on not the
schlock genres but the classics and serious, relevant contemporary
fiction. The likelihood is of their finding that the novel on its
best artistic behavior truly is what D.H. Lawrence called it _ the
``bright book of life.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ISLAMABAD _ Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who took
office in February 1997, arrives in Washington this week a
confident and hopeful man.
 &HT;    At home, the stark economic crisis prompted by the May nuclear
testing is somewhat under control _ at least for now. Politically,
Sharif faces no imminent threat from traditional political forces,
including Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
 &HT;    An opposition bloc struggling to mount an anti-Nawaz Sharif
political offensive has failed to capitalize on his blunders
including his introduction of the highly controversial Islamic
``shariah'' law. Sharif has even managed to establish
constitutional control over the army and the judiciary.
 &HT;    So now, in Washington, Sharif hopes to benefit from the ``sole
player'' position he currently occupies in Pakistani politics.
 &HT;    A great believer in conducting official business in a
personalized style, the Pakistani leader is pinning hopes on his
recent intensive and candid contacts with Bill Clinton. Beginning
with the May 17 Indian nuclear tests, Sharif and Clinton have
conducted at least six telephone calls and exchanged at least a
dozen letters. The two have also met twice during the 1997 and 1998
U.N. General Assembly sessions.
 &HT;    With this background, Sharif and Pakistan's Foreign Office team
expect that the ``summit'' will lead to progress on four issues.
 &HT;    _ First , on the economic front. Islamabad is banking on some
American largesse to help Pakistan 's economic recovery.
 &HT;    _ Second, on the military front. Pakistan's armed forces are
greatly handicapped by the ban imposed under the 1990 Pressler
Amendment on the supply of military equipment and military spare
parts. Since the United States has remained a virtual sole supplier
for Pakistan's conventional weapons, non-availability of spare
parts, including those for its F-16 fighters and air force radar
systems, further aggravate an imbalance of conventional weapons in
India's favor.
 &HT;    Sharif hopes the U.S. establishment will lift the sanctions
under Pressler. Indeed, an optimistic Sharif told journalists in
Islamabad on Nov. 25 that Washington would lift military sanctions
realizing their ``futility.'' However, striking a warning note for
Washington's non-proliferationists, he added that if the imbalance
in conventional weaponry continued, ``Pakistan would have to rely
on its nuclear capability.''
 &HT;    Significantly, in also maintaining that ``most problems will be
solved and there would be forward movement on other issues if this
imbalance is rectified,'' Nawaz Sharif linked progress in the
Pakistani-U.S. strategic relationship and in peace and stability in
South Asia to Washington's decision to lift military sanctions.
 &HT;    _ Third, on the Kashmir front. Having observed a substantial
policy shift in Washington on the Kashmir issue, Sharif expects
Clinton to signal American willingness to mediate between Pakistan
and India for the settlement of the bloody war. Unlike its
pre-nuclear-test position, in which Washington viewed Kashmir as a
problem created by Pakistan-supported terrorists and by India's
denial of democratic rights to the Kashmiris, Washington now sees
the flashpoint as a major international issue which needs to be
addressed bilaterally and internationally.
 &HT;    With much satisfaction, the Pakistanis observe that global
players ranging from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, Nelson Mandela, and Clinton
himself all recognize that only settlement of Kashmir can establish
genuine peace in the region, promote non-proliferation and avert a
nuclear war in South Asia.
 &HT;    What perhaps has remained unpublicized is the fact that after
the Palestinian-Israeli Wye River Accord was signed in late October
1998, Clinton received a letter from the Pakistani prime minister
urging him to play a similar role in the Kashmir tragedy. Sharif
told Clinton he was destined to play a historic role in resolving
the Kashmir issue and that he was morally obliged to play an active
role.
 &HT;    _ Finally, Islamabad is hoping that Washington will propose an
``acceptable solution'' to the F-16 issue. Islamabad has repeatedly
indicated to the Americans that an acceptable solution is either
the return of almost $500 million that Pakistan paid for 26 F-16
planes or their delivery.
 &HT;    American officials who already have pleaded an inability to do
either are, however, proposing a debt draw-down against the arrears
incurred by Pakistan from various credit lines opened for it to
import wheat. This year alone half a million metric tons of wheat
have been imported. But this debt-retirement option has been
repeatedly rejected by Pakistan.
 &HT;    In Islamabad, officials maintain that Pakistan is under no
pressure to settle the American loans which are made available on
easy terms for more than a 25-year term.
 &HT;    Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed has told his counterpart, U.S.
Under-Secretary Strobe Talbott, that such an offer is
``unacceptable to Pakistan both economically and militarily.''
 &HT;    Washington has its own concerns. Primarily Clinton would hope to
get some concrete date from the visiting prime minister for the
signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, and
similarly, dates for when Pakistan's Parliament would legislate
nuclear-technology export controls laws.
 &HT;    Clinton has in a Nov. 6 letter to Nawaz Sharif spelled out the
American expectation that Pakistan make concrete movement on the
nuclear non-proliferation front. This would justify Clinton's
decision days ago to lift some sanctions on Pakistan in the
aftermath of the nuclear tests.
 &HT;    There is another issue on which Clinton will specially focus:
Osama bin Laden. Washington, having failed even after the Aug. 20
deployment of its latest batch of Tomahawk cruise missiles to bring
death to bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding the August
bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, is now seeking Pakistan's
help to acquire his capture. Clearly, however, the Pakistani prime
minister has neither the ability nor the inclination to plead
America's case with the Taliban of Afghanistan, where bin Laden
lives.
 &HT;    Yet, standing at the threshold of the new millennium, a nuclear
Pakistan, many believe, should go the distance to articulate the
basis of Pakistan-U.S. relations in terms of genuinely shared
interests. Today, in the post-Cold War era, these go beyond the
mindset of the '50s, '60s and '80s when the projection of
Pakistan's strategic significance referred only to Washington's
agenda _ whether it be anti-Arab nationalist, anti-communist or
anti-fundamentalist Islam. Instead, the common interests would
include peace in South Asia, regional economic development, nuclear
nonproliferation and peace and stability on the subcontinent.
 &HT;    As a country located at the crossroads of four key political,
economic and civilization zones _ Central Asia, South Asia,
Southwest Asia and China _ Pakistan enjoys a multi-civilizational
identity. It could be a natural breeding ground for cooperation and
cross-civilizational harmony.
 &HT;    Instead of perpetuating an ethos of servitude, presenting
Pakistan for the use of the West as a readily available ``link,''
Nawaz Sharif should invite Washington into a real partnership
relationship. How attractive a partner Pakistan proves to be
depends inevitably on the home realities of economics, security and
politics.
 &HT;    For the United States, which still operates in the largely
troubled zone with Muslim countries ranging from Iraq to Iran and
from Sudan to Afghanistan, Washington needs to judiciously
cultivate bilateral relations with Pakistan. For it is one Muslim
country that remains genuinely engaged with the others.
 &HT;    Instead of sounding like a Washington protege offering
cooperation with Washington's agenda of human rights, narcotics
control and anti-terrorism, Nawaz Sharif in Washington is in a
position to offer real partnership to Clinton in defining and
promoting the agenda of human progress and global security.

PARENTS FACE A RASH OF ADVICE ON DEALING WITH DIAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CINDY RAMOS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A celebration ensues every time 2-year-old Michael
Ellison uses his big-boy potty.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers from big sister Kiyana, who is 4, put a smile on his
face. Proud mother LaKisha Wright is just a few weeks away from a
diaper-free household.
</P>
<P>
   Not all moms and dads can sing the same tune.
</P>
<P>
   More and more children are being potty trained later in life.
Last year, the first large-scale study of toilet training in 30
years reported that only 22 percent of children are trained by
Michael's age. In the 1960s, 90 percent of toddlers were toilet
trained by age 2 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   And the $4 billion diaper industry is responding to _ perhaps
driving _ that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Pampers introduced their biggest diaper, size 6, in June.
Huggies' size 6 hit the stores last month. Manufacturers say the
diaper, for children weighing around 35 pounds, is made
specifically for the huskier toddler and the older child who is not
psychologically ready to start potty training.
</P>
<P>
   The diaper has re-ignited the debate over what method of toilet
training is best.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are calling the new diaper a blessing; others say
it's just another excuse for delaying training.
</P>
<P>
   Wright wants nothing to do with a larger diaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That larger diaper is nothing but a pacifier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is training her son in a cloth training pant so he can feel
the wetness a thickly padded training pant masks. She thinks the
``child-led'' approach to training has gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child develops differently, but sometimes we have to
push a little,'' Wright said. ``I think with the right motivation
and encouragement we should be able to teach our children anything,
especially how to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, a pediatrician who is consultant for the
Pampers Parenting Institute, has used the child-led, pressure-free
approach to toilet training with thousands of his patients. He
asked Pampers for the larger diaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush your toddler into toilet training or let anyone
else tell you it's time,'' Brazelton advised. ``It's got to be his
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazelton appears in a Pampers commercial for size 6 diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Proctor &AMP; Gamble Co., maker of Pampers, listened to ``tons
and tons'' of moms whose children grew out of size 5 and weren't
ready to move to the next step, training pants or underwear, said
Howard Lossing, the Pampers brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child is ready to potty train at the age of 2, that's
wonderful. It just doesn't happen in every case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new size 6 diapers have come a little too late for Donna
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's 4-year-old son Kenneth was toilet trained by the time
he was 3 years and 2 months old, but he outgrew his size 5 diaper
before that happened. Russell had to use a training pant product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard training him with Pull-ups because it confused the
issue with underwear,'' Russell said. When Kenneth was ready to
move to regular underwear, he soiled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have had larger diapers,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   She intends to train her 11-month-old son with the same
``when-he's-ready'' theory and said the larger diaper would come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Pampers' size 6 sales are brisk, Lossing said, although
some mothers have called the company saying ``shame on you for
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``for every one bad call I get, there's 20 great calls
saying thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendi Strong, spokeswoman for Kimberly Clark, maker of Huggies,
said it was too soon to gauge the success of the larger diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of Drypers is taking the wait-and-see approach
before making any plans for a larger diaper, a company spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents point to two reasons that children in the 1950s and
1960s were toilet trained earlier: Today's disposable diapers keep
children more comfortable than cloth diapers, and more mothers
stayed home and were able to keep their children on a consistent
training plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the major diaper study last year discounted those theories.
A researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
concluded the age at which a child is trained has nothing to do
with whether he or she was in day care, had siblings or a mother
who worked.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Pehl of New Braunfels, Texas, said working or a lack of
time is not an excuse for unsuccessful potty training.
</P>
<P>
   Pehl, a mother of five grown children, worked as a full-time
secretary and had all her children potty trained before the age of
2. She said the big problem is disposable diapers; she used cloth
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it themselves, not forced or pushed into it, but on
their own,'' she said. ``Once they began to walk and wanted to go
places or do things and they discovered how uncomfortable it was to
be in wet or messy diapers, they quickly learned what they had to
do to stay dry.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with many aspects of parenting, there is no right or wrong
way to teach children to use the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason there is so much conflicting advice out there is
that there's no one method that works best for all kids,'' said Dr.
Alan Greene, the on-line pediatrician at parentsoup.com and the
voice behind the audio cassettes ``Poop Happens'' and ``Done With
Diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who also is on the staff of Harvard Children's Hospital,
is happy to see the new size 6 diaper for children who aren't ready
to potty train.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned that a lot of people won't pay
attention to toileting issues early on and just kind of wait for it
to happen without being involved with their kids because of the
bigger ones (diapers) that are out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can look for several signs to tell when their children
might be ready to start the toilet-training process.
</P>
<P>
   Most children start showing signs between 18 and 24 months. A
telling sign is when they start announcing when they've just
finished soiling their diaper, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Some children, for many reasons, have a hard time letting go of
diapers and padded training pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the terrible 2's is to resist what parents are
pushing,'' Greene said. ``So if the toilet is the thing, they'll
start to try to hold in the stool, then they'll get constipated,
then it will hurt when they go to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to watch and listen to your child and
to try and be on the same time table as him or her.''

<P>
   A few weeks ago I went to Cartagena de Indias to lecture at a
seminar for journalists on the theme of poverty in Latin America. A
dozen reporters participated _ from countries as diverse as
Guatemala and Bolivia, Argentina and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   My turn to speak was at siesta time, at an hour when Cartagena
is so humid and hot that no dog is seen on the streets nor birds in
the thick yellow sky. Nothing of what I said was important, but
what we heard was enough to keep us not only awake, but full of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, two lecturers from the Interamerican Development Bank
proved, with numbers and statistics, that the various free-market
reforms in the region were not as bad as they seemed: education and
health, for instance, had improved slightly.
</P>
<P>
   They did point out that inequality and corruption have worsened,
and by now seem to be endemic woes. Among the nine countries most
affected by official corruption, the statistics show, five are
Latin American. The number rises to six if Haiti is included, but
it seems that all statistics from that country are as mysterious
and inscrutable as voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that one clear tragedy is the growth of
unemployment. Ten years ago it was shameful that up to 10 percent
of workers didn't have a job. Now this rate is nearly double and
governments seem incapable of solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The answers were complex _ the obvious need for productive
employment was a quickly discarded idea. Productive jobs are not
possible, the journalists agreed, when what really counts in the
work market is not efficiency, but political patronage, paying back
favors and being allied with those who have power. Another salient
fact: the mass migration of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Every reporter was able to present at least one example of
extravagant or inexplicable spending in places where misery was
rampant: great airports and wide freeways that end at the foot of
local political strongmen's homes, first-rate hospitals in lost
villages where there are no doctors, five-star hotels built in
inaccessible deserts.
</P>
<P>
   But the true tragedies of poverty were discussed later in the
day. One of the most moving was narrated by a Bolivian journalist:
the hopeless condition of families in the garbage dumps of
Cochabamba, where whole neighborhoods of houses are built with
cardboard and plastic bags. The principal means of survival is the
scavenged plastic waste people sell to factories, earning about $1
per day.
</P>
<P>
   In these neighborhoods, nurses at the small clinic or female
nursery school teachers earn less than a beggar: about $45 per
month. Almost all of them had better jobs in the past _ in
electronics factories that closed, in tin mines that ran out, in
banks that failed.
</P>
<P>
   In Bolivia, as in the other countries of Latin America, state
reform may have restored the statistics and appearance of health to
national economies and revived the confidence of those
all-important foreign investors, but there is chaos among the lower
classes. Most people who lose their jobs are never able to return
to their former status.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that the opposite is happening in the United
States. Here the economy is healthier every day, the boom times are
felt in the very air of the cities and employment is a very serious
problem, but only because there are too many jobs and not enough
people to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the manager of a large bookstore chain told me it's
difficult to find salespeople for their new outlets. Everybody has
other things to do, and $25,000 annual salaries aren't enough to
attract many people.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the news of this economic boom is spreading like
wildfire in Latin America and migrants are turning the U.S.
frontier with Mexico into a curtain of sand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the story that most impressed us in Cartagena's
seminar was the one told by a woman reporter from Puebla, Mexico.
She spoke about the odyssey of Felix Sanchez, a peasant from
Piaxtla who arrived in Los Angeles without immigration documents
and worked in a small electrical lamp factory while his wife worked
at home as a seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of hard labor and suffering, he managed to save
$12,000 and bought a machine to make tortillas so he could sell
them door to door in the homes of the city's Mexican community.
Now, 20 years later, Sanchez owns a strong company, Puebla Foods,
with annual sales of $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago he tried to take his good luck back to
Mexico and worked to establish a chile canning factory in Piaxtla.
He couldn't do it, though, because the town's road infrastructure
is abominable and everything that's produced in the region _ which
is still racked by poverty _ stays there.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are crowds of immigrants on the streets of New York,
Chicago, Boston or Boulder _ not to mention Los Angeles and Miami.
Even the Latin Americans most proud of their national culture, such
as Brazilians and Venezuelans, are running away by the thousands
toward the North, and with a frightening desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are coming to collect everything we took from them,''
the bookstore manager told me, with a clear irony. Nevertheless,
nothing of what was taken from us in the past _ if that is anything
at all _ has the immense value of what is being offered now: the
people.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America has lived for more than five centuries in a state
of poverty. The one that's starting now, with its great exodus to
the North, may be the worst privation of all.

   A few weeks ago I went to Cartagena de Indias to lecture at a
seminar for journalists on the theme of poverty in Latin America. A
dozen reporters participated _ from countries as diverse as
Guatemala and Bolivia, Argentina and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   My turn to speak was at siesta time, at an hour when Cartagena
is so humid and hot that no dog is seen on the streets nor birds in
the thick yellow sky. Nothing of what I said was important, but
what we heard was enough to keep us not only awake, but full of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, two lecturers from the Interamerican Development Bank
proved, with numbers and statistics, that the various free-market
reforms in the region were not as bad as they seemed: education and
health, for instance, had improved slightly.
</P>
<P>
   They did point out that inequality and corruption have worsened,
and by now seem to be endemic woes. Among the nine countries most
affected by official corruption, the statistics show, five are
Latin American. The number rises to six if Haiti is included, but
it seems that all statistics from that country are as mysterious
and inscrutable as voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that one clear tragedy is the growth of
unemployment. Ten years ago it was shameful that up to 10 percent
of workers didn't have a job. Now this rate is nearly double and
governments seem incapable of solving the problem.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When I was in college, there was a guy famous for wrapping his
brand-new Weejuns with duct tape so that it would look as though
his soles were already flapping. He also, or so it was said, took
brand-new shirts from Brooks Brothers and painstakingly frayed the
cuffs with sandpaper.
 &HT;    This was at Yale in the late '60s, during the last wheezing gasp
_ the final catarrh _ of the patrician ethos that held that the
ultimate status, the highest social perch, belonged to those who
seemingly paid no attention to status. That poor Yalie, with his
tape and sandpaper, made the fatal mistake, of course: He cared too
much and, worse, was seen to care. But in other respects he
understood the code perfectly.
 &HT;    In those days, old was still good. Shabby was good. Instead of
renting a tuxedo, for example, or even buying a new one, it was far
cooler to borrow your great-uncle Ned's _ that hand-sewn mohair
dreadnought, now mossy with age, that he wore to the Stork Club in
the '40s while squiring tipsy debutantes.
 &HT;    What recommended this mothy garment was not just its special
flask pocket or the cigarette burn on the left lapel but that it
(quietly) advertised you as someone who came from tuxedo-wearing
stock, the sort of people who donned formal wear all the time and
not just on self-conscious occasions.
 &HT;    This particular social code owed a lot, obviously, to the old
WASP tradition, with its shunning of vulgar display and its
reverence for old (as opposed to new) anything _ houses, silver,
furniture and, especially, money. And American WASP-iness _
filtered through our Puritan heritage _ in turn owes something to
an imagined ideal of life among the landed British gentry.
 &HT;    You can see the real thing, lovingly and comically depicted, in
the novels of Nancy Mitford or, more recently, in ``The Dower
House,'' by Annabel Davis-Goff, a novel about arguably the most
puritanically class- and status-obsessed people who ever lived: the
Anglo-Irish, who by the 1960s, when this book is set, are neither
truly English nor truly Irish anymore. All they have left, their
sole badge of identity, is good breeding (among themselves and,
just as important, among their dogs and horses) and their dwindling
store of heirlooms.
 &HT;    In the novel's funniest and most painful scene, the scion of a
noble but down-at-the-heels family describes his attempt to repair
his family's fortunes by marrying a girl from London: The courtship
has to be abandoned when, in a shocking display of commonness, she
carries her handbag down to breakfast.
 &HT;    In midcentury America, you didn't have to be a WASP to
appreciate WASP values. In Irish Boston, where I grew up _ Catholic
Irish, not the other kind _ the middle and working classes
sedulously adopted the customs and preferences of their Yankee
overlords. Men took pride in how often their shoes had been reshod,
in the number of times their car odometers had ticked over.
 &HT;    When our next-door neighbor pulled up one evening in a
late-model Cadillac, eyebrows were raised for weeks _ until it was
discovered that he had inherited it from his father-in-law, who was
an undertaker.
 &HT;    For WASP and non-WASP alike, the old status indicators _ thrift,
simplicity, understatement, self-effacement _ made a virtue of the
inescapable: ignorance, insecurity, penury, not to say stinginess.
They also placed a not entirely inappropriate value on history _ on
things (and the people who owned them) that had stood the test of
time.
 &HT;    So what happened? WASP, where is thy sting? Already when I was
in college, there were hints of a new elite, of non-status-seeking
pursued with unimaginable rigor. There were people who didn't even
own Weejuns, much less tape them _ who either didn't know the code
or didn't care and militantly rejected the very idea of property
and hierarchy. (Many of them, after brief stints on the commune,
went on to lucrative careers in investment banking and commercial
real estate.)
 &HT;    And then there were the puritans and the minimalists; you see
them even now, or their descendants, down on Spring Street on
Saturday afternoons _ Mom, Dad and Baby all clad in black, eating
rice cakes and drinking designer water.
 &HT;    The WASP's, meanwhile, fell from their once-lofty ascendance,
done in by inheritance taxes, inbreeding and newly rigorous
admissions standards at the very institutions they once regarded as
their finishing schools. Uncle Ned, were he alive now, would no
longer be working at the family firm. (It was bought out by the
Japanese years ago.)
 &HT;    There's also not enough old stuff to go around anymore. (At a
Sotheby's show of ``important Americana'' recently, I spotted among
the highboys and the sideboards an item labeled ``Sheraton style
... 20th century.'' It was a 1950s coffee table.)
 &HT;    But a more fundamental trouble with the old WASP idea of status
was that it depended on a code as subtle and as complicated as
18th-century calling-card etiquette. The line between an heirloom
and a piece of junk was often hard to draw, as was that between
being ``old shoe'' and looking like a bum. As time went on, fewer
and fewer people knew the signals, until they ceased to be
recognized even by the people who were sending them.
 &HT;    When you think about it, there was probably something phony and
overearnest about America's long romance with gentility and
authenticity. We have always been vulgar _ it's our defining trait.
At the turn of the century, the really rich and really
status-conscious Americans, the people who set the tone that so
many aspired to, were not self-effacing or puritanical at all.
 &HT;    This is the great theme of Edith Wharton and Henry James, that
the Gilded Agers literally wanted entitlement. They wanted palaces
and noble lineage, and they wanted real history, so they went to
Europe and brought it all back _ instant class. Such is the miracle
of America: you can get it now in a good department store in the
Ralph Lauren boutique.
 &HT;    Lauren's genius has been to provide not only stuff that looks
new and feels old _ loafers with a patina of invisible duct tape,
so to speak _ but also a prepackaged ancestral past: cotillions,
hunts, summers at the Adirondack camp. An Uncle Ned for everyone.

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not
talent and perseverance, are now what's most widely respected.
Ex-actors and ex-athletes and relatives of ex-politicians occupy
more and more seats in Congress.
 &HT;    They have instant ``name recognition,'' which is almost as
useful in campaigns these days as money, which propels other people
into high office. You have to wonder whether Abe Lincoln _ homely,
provincial and poor _ would have had a shot at the modern White
House.
 &HT;    Note too that candidates have adopted the techniques of show

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The royal train, sleek and black with pencil-thin red trimming,
is hurtling toward Newcastle, and inside one of the armored middle
cars, Charles, the prince of Wales, is taking his breakfast.
 &HT;    He's dressed down in an open-collar white-and-burgundy striped
shirt, blue cardigan and khaki trousers, and as I enter the cabin,
his look of welcome is mixed with one of concern.
 &HT;    ``I do hope you managed to get some sleep,'' he says, motioning
me to sit across from him.
 &HT;    Gales and lashing rain had rolled in from the North Sea as we
made our midnight departure from Perth, and the heir to the throne
seems to be apologizing for turbulence in the realm.
 &HT;    ``Ghastly night,'' he says.
 &HT;    Freshly done up in blond wood with little ornamentation, the
coach reflects a new reduced configuration aimed at cutting the
train's operating cost. Part of royal downsizing? I ask.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' he nods. ``What you see is the anorexic British
monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a corner bookcase, there is a small vase of flowers and a
picture of the Queen Mother, said to be Prince Charles' favorite
member of the family. Earlier her two corgis, Dash and Rash, had
taken their morning stroll through the carpeted corridors, friskily
tugging at the leash held by her footman, Leslie Campbell.
 &HT;    The prince's face is ruddy from a blustery weekend at his home
on the Balmoral estate in Scotland, and gray is making a debonair
debut in his thinning hair. His ears are large, as advertised, but
they ride closer to his head and in happier proportion to it than
cartoonists' pens would have you believe.
 &HT;    He speaks so softly that I have to strain to hear him even in
the stillness of the cabin, with its thick, bulletproof windows
keeping out the clatter of our passage along England's northeastern
coast.
 &HT;    Smartly turned out crewmen in navy blazers, charcoal gray
trousers and black shoes shined to a military gloss place before
the prince a silver tray with small jars of preserves and honeys
and a bowl of wheat germ and cereal grains, all of which meet his
high threshold for unadulterated, healthful food.
 &HT;    He reaches for a container of honey, opens it and spoons the
golden spread directly into his mouth. I think I am observing royal
prerogative.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't eat very much at all,'' he says, confirming
the warnings I had received minutes earlier from the butlers and
security men in the mess car as they tucked into their heaping
platefuls of eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, bacon and toast.
 &HT;    In fact the atmosphere around the prince and his once-embattled
retinue is assured and upbeat these days. Not long ago the most
reviled member of the British royal family, Charles was able on his
50th birthday in November to look back on a year in which he was
liberated from the competition with Diana, the princess of Wales,
for attention and approval.
 &HT;    He also was given credit previously denied him for being a
sensitive parent to his two sons; was celebrated by the new Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for the pioneering social
work his Prince's Trust has done; and was encouraged by
significantly growing public endorsement of him as the next
sovereign and of his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, as his
private life companion and possible wife.
 &HT;    He has turned the most convulsive moment in his life _ the death
in August 1997 of his former wife, Diana _ into an opportunity for
staging his own revival and for staking a strong claim on the role
of guiding the monarchy into the 21st century.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, his progress has freshened the image of the monarchy.
Mutinous feelings in Britain toward the royals have subsided, and
the major player in disarming the public has surprisingly been
Prince Charles.
 &HT;    For a long time the percussive, single-syllable words like
``twit,'' ``wimp'' and ''prat'' that Britons use to dress down
their well-born often accompanied mention of his name. The product
of an undemonstrative mother, a chastising father and the decidedly
uncozy Windsor household, Charles suffered from self-doubt and
appeared hesitant and distracted in the face of the burdensome
demands of his awesome inheritance.
 &HT;    The question he most commonly puts to people he encounters now
on his official rounds _ ``What do you do?'' _ is one he might have
best avoided years ago for fear someone might ask him back.
 &HT;    When he got around to doing something, he only made matters
worse, uttering ill-thought-out and crudely stated condemnations of
modern architecture, medicine and education. By the time Diana
began attracting favorable attention for her visits to AIDS wards
and refugee camps, Charles had marked himself as something of a
young fogy, dismissing new approaches to old problems as
``fashionable.''
 &HT;    What's more, he was conducting a personal life that became an
ongoing tabloid saga complete with confessional television
interviews and smutty tape recordings of stunningly graceless
sexual small talk.
 &HT;    Recently, however, newspaper and magazine articles and new books
assessing him in connection with his birthday have portrayed a
new-look prince and declared him an underacknowledged overachiever
whose good works went unnoticed in the press onslaught on his
shortcomings.
 &HT;    Anthony Holden, a royal biographer considered hostile by the
prince's supporters and denied all cooperation for his new book,
``Charles at Fifty,'' concluded that ``the human qualities well
known to his inner circle, for all the battering they took during
the Diana years, have come back to the fore. If not entirely at
peace with himself, he is more so with the world around him. Throw
in the shrewdest advisers he has had since his youth, extending
beyond his own office to the inner councils of government, and you
have a public figure suddenly and unexpectedly at the peak of his
powers, bloodied but unbowed by his past, with cause for unwonted
optimism about his future.''
 &HT;    The prince's schedule for this day alone calls for him to spend
seven hours opening a home for the aged, a glass museum, a
job-training center and, most improbably, an oil rig. True, there's
nothing new about the prince of Wales going off to lay cornerstones
and plant trees. In 1997, he had 513 engagements like this.
 &HT;    What is new is that he is no longer alone with his ceremonial
shovel. People are paying attention, and they are doing so because
the ideas of a man long associated with the country's past now seem
very much a part of its future.
 &HT;    Back in the staff mess car, one of Charles' aides confided that
he believed the most significant factor in the changing fortunes of
the prince was the election in May 1997 of Tony Blair and the Labor
Party: ``Suddenly his views became part of the political language
of this country.''
 &HT;    It is a breathtaking fact that many of the reforms the Labor
government is pursuing _ getting private enterprise engaged in
public service and opening up opportunities for young people,
minorities and the unemployed _ are ones that have been undertaken
for years by a member of the famously out-of-touch British
monarchy. On issues such as the environment, genetically modified
food and organic farming, the prince has even bolder prescriptions
than the government.
 &HT;    Where the queen just this year rode in her first public taxi,
walked into her first McDonald's and visited her first pub, Prince
Charles has been tramping through housing projects for two decades.
In 1976, he began a program that made loans available to young
people whom banks wouldn't go near, and the idea is credited with
having helped more than 40,000 people to start new businesses.
 &HT;    Several people who run sections of the Prince's Trust said they
know Charles was motivated to act in the 1980s by evidence that
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic revolution was leaving
Britain's poor unprotected and marginalized.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't that he used her name,'' said one executive close to
the prince. ``He spoke out when it was very unfashionable to have
these concerns, and he was the one who persuaded business it had to
enter areas that the government was abandoning.''
 &HT;    Financed by the consolidation of three royal trusts and by
contributions from corporations and individuals, the trust today
manages an endowment of $125 million.
 &HT;    Blair's people have praised the prince for his foresightedness,
and the prince has expressed his pleasure that Labor has found
inspiration in his good works. One gleeful Labor official said,
``He was a Blairite before Blair.''
 &HT;    In contrast, the queen is not known to have any political
viewpoints, and in her long years on the throne she has never been
caught out expressing one. She and Prince Philip are reported by
biographers to be put off by their eldest son's social activism in
general and the perception that he could be playing favorites in
Britain's public life.
 &HT;    The prince has not responded to the grumbling in the House of
Commons about his role, but he has long said the monarchy of the
future should be ``a contributing monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a letter to Tom Shebbeare, the head of the trust, five years
ago, he addressed the question, saying, ``I have no 'political'
agenda _ only a desire to see people achieve their potential.'' He
reasoned that his ability to get attention made him ``a catalyst to
help produce a better and more balanced response to various
problems.''
 &HT;    The prince has known the prime minister since 1990, when Blair
was Labor's shadow employment secretary and took an interest in the
work the Prince's Trust was doing in the area of youth employment.
Their relationship was to deepen in the immediate aftermath of the
death of Diana, as the royal family found itself tone-deaf to the
sorrow and anger of the nation and looked to the newly triumphant
Labor government for help tuning in.
 &HT;    Blair and the prince spoke by phone during the flight Charles
made to Paris to bring Diana's body back to Britain, and associates
of the prime minister played a prominent role in planning the
funeral and in encouraging the royal family to respond to the
outpouring of grief. The prince is the member of the family
credited with convincing the palace that it was too remote, and
much of his counsel came from Blair officials.
 &HT;    Today, on the prince's staff are none of the advisers who
counseled him to confess his adultery in a 1994 television
interview, a strategic decision he now regrets.
 &HT;    While the queen has kept her private secretaries for decades at
a time, Charles has had six since 1985, a measure of his
temperamental leadership. He has now settled down and reached out
to the worlds of politics and entertainment for help. By design,
his staff is no longer all male, all white, all Oxford- and
Cambridge-educated.
 &HT;    Often at odds with their more tradition-bound counterparts in
Buckingham Palace, the prince's people are busy putting forth their
man as the voice of the monarchy's future, even going so far as to
set up his own Web site _ www.princeofwales.gov.uk.
 &HT;    The prince's current honeymoon with the British press began
after a simple act of reconciliation suggested by his new aides.
For 10 years, he had not directed a personal word at any of the
reporters covering him.
 &HT;    Then, on a trip between South Africa and Swaziland last year, a
shirt-sleeved prince walked back to the economy section of the
plane where the press was riding and struck up conversations. He
captivated the surprised reporters with a few jokes on himself, and
by the same afternoon The Evening Standard was on the streets of
London with a front page saying, ``Chattering Charles Plays Royal
Tour Joker.''
 &HT;    The charm offensive was on. Public appearances increased and
Charles began to be seen at West End first nights, film openings,
Spice Girl concerts _ in short, the circles where Diana once
reigned. The usual titled guests at dinners at St. James' Palace
and at Highgrove found themselves seated next to Charles' new
friends, such as Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson, whose comic
creation Mr. Bean has come, like the prince, to represent the
lovable side of English awkwardness.
 &HT;    The Sun, Britain's largest-selling tabloid and long a Charles
tormentor, became the recipient of leaks from the prince's office
and made a rapid conversion to the rehabilitation cause. The prince
and his organic garden at Highgrove were lovingly chronicled in
celebrity magazines such as Hello!
 &HT;    Charles took his sons to Vancouver, where they publicly
frolicked in the caps of the Canadian Winter Olympics team. And, in
a gesture interpreted as a truce, the prince agreed to serve as
patron for a new press ball.
 &HT;    At a televised birthday gala, the prince became the star of the
show, appearing in a skit with the actors Stephen Fry and Roger
Moore. The scene was a restaurant, and look-alikes of Michael
Jackson, Tina Turner, Madonna and Humphrey Bogart appeared on stage
as Fry and Moore, the diners, tried unsuccessfully to guess who
they were.
 &HT;    Charles, an accomplished college actor at Cambridge, then walked
on, playing a waiter with a cloth napkin slung over his forearm and
a pen and pad at the ready. When the cheers died down, he
recommended the organic vegetables and cookies made from the
Highgrove granary. ``They're damn good,'' he said.
 &HT;    Moore pondered the prince's performance. ``I know who you're
supposed to be, but you are going to have work on your voice a
bit,'' he said to the laughing crowd.
 &HT;    The aides who have helped engineer the turnabout in public
opinion are encouraged about the future. ``We find doors flying
open everywhere now where we had to really struggle before,'' one
said.
 &HT;    Though the recognition of the prince's pioneering
accomplishments and the public sympathy for him as a single parent
have given him new balance, Charles can still stumble over his
bulky collection of resentments.
 &HT;    There is, first and foremost, the somewhat icy, always
complicated relationship with his parents. It is clear too that the
prince has not fully freed himself from the sense of anger he felt
a year ago at being cast as a villain who betrayed a saint, a
careless adulterer who married a virgin for dynastic reasons and
then destroyed her emotionally.
 &HT;    ``You know the prince thought that Diana was on a mission to
destroy him,'' one courtier explained. He recalled a night in which
Charles could talk of nothing else until the aide, a relative
newcomer to the staff, said: ``You can't keep going on like this.
You must get on with your future.''
 &HT;    The prince agreed that he was being ``obsessive'' but insisted
on talking on. ``Unless you hear what went on in the past,'' he
said, ``you won't understand how I am today.''
 &HT;    How he is today, friends say, is a lot more pleasant than he
used to be, and the behavior figures prominently in his
rehabilitation.
 &HT;    ``He's actually doing the same things he did before,'' said a
Prince's Trust executive, ``but he is much more relaxed and
confident that he can do things on his own. It helps not having
someone out there saying, 'I can do that better than you can.'''
 &HT;    Of course, he is still far from taming his notorious moodiness
or mastering his tantrums, but the best antidote to them, Camilla
Parker Bowles, is more frequently at hand.
 &HT;    ``He is a world-class, wall-to-wall whinger,'' one of his
closest aides said, invoking the English word for whining that
makes self-pity sound even more insufferable.
 &HT;    A woman who heads up one of his charities looked aghast at the
recollection of a moment when she lost patience with the prince and
apparently lost track of whom she was speaking to. ``He does moan
about so,'' she said. ``One day I just said to him: 'Stop
complaining. We all have problem parents.'''

 AMERICA FELL SHORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
 
 &HT;    The following op-ed-length articles from the November/December
'98 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, described in more detail below, have
moved on the wire _ in the ``k'' and ``a'' category codes _ from
The New York Times Syndicate.
 &HT;    _ They are also available in full-text versions, which range
from 2,500 to 6,000 words. _ By Ruth Wedgwood  
 &HT;    (1,200 words) An historic opportunity to shape the International
Criminal Court in America's image was lost. What the world has
instead is a court America cannot agree to _ at least not until its
good faith has been tested over years.

 ISRAEL AFTER HEROISM  
 By Eliot A. Cohen  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) Above all, the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995 struck a blow at a major Israeli myth _ that no
matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade its politics, in
the end these are merely words, and the nation will stand together.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'  
 By Nicholas D. Kristof  
 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in
between _ which makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even
more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

   &UR; TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996
official study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of
November 1995 _ show that American officials were painfully aware
of the shortcomings of U.S. policy. Dayton's lessons are grimly

aggressive fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled but
never eliminated. The world scene will always be populated by
states led by the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if
the democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a

   Today, quietly, without most Americans noticing, a revolution
has turned the U.S. defense industry upside down. The idea that
every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but
lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to a time when
CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,
and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in top-secret
grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'  
 By Nicholas D. Kristof  
 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in
between _ which makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even
more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

past. By now, this attitude should be history, but it's not.

 &UR; By Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Part I: RULES of the ROAD FOR AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. But the demands
upon us have not lessened. The patterns of world affairs shift with
each spin of the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old
problems reemerge. (slugged: BC-GOALS-ALBRIGHT-ONE-NYTSF)

   &UR; Part II: SANCTIONS ARE JUST ONE TOOL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view
of dissent. Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China
while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma. Some accuse us of having a double standard. But
that's not true. (slugged: BC-SANCTIONS-ALBRIGHT-TWO-NYTSF)

<P>
   &UR; Part III: FIVE MAJOR TESTS OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nations must unite in the struggle against terror. The U.N.
Security Council must deal firmly with Saddam Hussein's game of
threats and defiance. We must be resolute in our dealings with
North Korea. We must stand firmly behind implementation of the
Dayton Accords. The global community must redouble its efforts to
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. (slugged:

   &UR; Part IV: FREEDOM IS AMERICA'S PURPOSE &LR;  &QL;

   We are the No. 1 debtor to the United Nations and the
multilateral development banks. We have been cutting foreign-policy
positions, closing diplomatic posts and shutting U.S. Agency for
International Development and U.S. Information Agency missions. We
lack the funds to provide full security for Americans overseas. Yet

   &UR; TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Warren Bass &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996
official study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of
November 1995 _ show that American officials were painfully aware
of the shortcomings of U.S. policy. Dayton's lessons are grimly

</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) After years of being tolerated with a mixture of
apathy, cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of
serious international action. Today corruption is harder to hide,
as the wave of bribery scandals involving high-level officials in
Europe, Asia and South America demonstrates. (slugged:

   &UR; WHAT IF WOMEN RAN THE WORLD? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Francis Fukuyama &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Male tendencies to band together for competitive
purposes, seek to dominate status hierarchies, and act out
aggressive fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled but
never eliminated. The world scene will always be populated by
states led by the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if
the democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a
zone of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it
will still have to deal with those parts of the world run by young,
ambitious, unconstrained men.

<P>
   Today, quietly, without most Americans noticing, a revolution
has turned the U.S. defense industry upside down. The idea that
every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but
lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to a time when
CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,
and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in top-secret
grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

THE QUICK WAY TO HEAVEN IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pope John Paul II has issued a papal bull
proclaiming 2000 a Holy Year, and prescribing good works and
penitence to be done that year. The rich can help the poor, the
free can help the incarcerated, and the church can seek forgiveness
for past errors.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also said Catholics could give up smoking or drinking
for a day and obtain an ``indulgence'' to get on the fast track
into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, an indulgence gives you time off from purgatory for
good behavior. Purgatory and indulgences, by the way, are
inventions of the medieval church and not mentioned in Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   The clause about getting an indulgence for a day without tobacco
or beer was down in the fine print of the papal bull, but naturally
it became the lead of all the newspaper stories. You can see why it
appeals to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the rigors of being a newspaper columnist in San
Francisco, I've given up drinking for a day many times _ sincerely,
as the bull specifies. Now it qualifies me for the express line to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that simple, of course. Nothing is in theology. But
what's the waiting period for becoming a Catholic?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton must be sorry he's a Baptist and has to go around
apologizing, asking forgiveness and getting spiritual counseling
from Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the things he can give up for a day, even those
things he doesn't inhale. Of course, no amount of indulgences will
release him from the purgatory of Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The only people this papal bull doesn't reward are those who
have nothing to give up. Sorry, but vegetarian, Evian-swilling
joggers will have to go to San Quentin and skid row to visit
prisoners and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   After Roman Catholic services on Sunday, indulgences were all
the talk. One nun who has served the church for five decades (and
obviously must remain anonymous) said: ``Oh, God. I hate it when
they do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, Catholics have to face doubt, and ironically because
of a document written by the remarkable John Paul II. Maybe someone
tinkered with the fine print of the appendix when he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pope who in 1991 asked the affluent to find
fellowship with the poor, and true meaning in life, by escaping the
``web of false and superficial gratifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, unfortunately, he'll be known as the inventor of the
one-day, one-step stairway to heaven plan. That isn't fair, and
getting to heaven isn't that easy in Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   As I understand them, indulgences give people time off from
suffering in this life or purgatory as purification for sins
already forgiven in confession. Many liberal Catholics see them as
an anachronism. It's been decades since they've talked about
purgatory or counted indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   They see them as brownie points, and don't want to go back to
the pre-Vatican II days of amassing them toward escape from
purgatory. Or putting them toward other souls stuck in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Does God know about these get-out-of-purgatory-free cards? And
does Windows have an indulgence-tabulation spreadsheet?
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is the greatest champion of the poor on Earth.
His effort to get believers, rich and middle class, to attend to
the poor on the 2,000th birthday of Christ is to be cheered.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I don't get any of this. Here I admit being from a
family that's half lapsed Catholic and half lapsed Protestant. I
have little background in theology or even Sunday school. But I
have always admired the good works of the Catholic Church, and
stand in awe of the spirit and intellect of John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't people care for the poor because they want to, not
because they want an indulgence? The pope has taught that a
spiritual transformation must be willed, and is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   And why give people the easy way out of giving up smoking or
drinking for a day? Lent takes longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century the church often sold indulgences, offering
access to heaven the way modern campaign contributors get access to
politicians. The sale of indulgences _ and later, indulgences
themselves _ was Martin Luther's biggest complaint against the
church, ultimately leading to the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Over-indulging in indulgences seems like an odd way to celebrate
2000. It's like looking back one millennium to the Middle Ages
instead of two millennia to the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, I'm not knocking the Catholic Church. I guess I'm just
envious.
</P>
<P>
   If I could escape purgatory by giving up one vice for a day, I'd
do it _ that is, if I believed in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is modern neo-puritanical America, and we're
supposed to give up drinking and smoking for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what they say. The first lifetime is the hardest.
</P>

IN THE OLDEN DAYS, WE HAD TO WALK TO SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to my sons, I'm ancient.
</P>
<P>
   I'm practically in heaven's waiting room. They can't even
understand how I survived my youth in the prehistoric era without a
cellular phone or a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   When I remind them that we didn't have cable television either,
they literally shudder. Isn't it ironic? I reacted the same way
when my mother told me she attended a school without air
conditioning and her family's telephone had a party line. Imagine
trying to have a conversation with the constant interruption of
other people attempting to use the line. Come to think of it, with
call-waiting, three-way calling, call-forwarding, caller-ID, and
conference calling, we still have party lines!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, whenever my boys start in on me about the ``olden
days,'' I always recall the statement that Bernard Baruch made on
his 85th birthday in 1955. He said, ``To me, old age is always 15
years older than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many young adults, I aggressively collected birthdays,
longing for maturity yet still thought that I would be young
forever. Now my sons' friends call me ``ma'am,'' and the only time
I'm ever asked to show ID is to prove that I haven't stolen a
credit card. Yes, life is indeed ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Some evenings when my kids are really bored, they ask me to tell
them a scary story about the olden days. We turn out the lights and
sit in the middle of the floor with a candle. As the flame casts
eerie shadows on my face, I begin, ``Long, long, ago _ back in the
early '70s ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooooo!'' they moan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ssshhh!'' I say. ``I haven't gotten to the scary part yet.
Every weekday, me and my friend Pam, would wake up at 6 in the
morning, dress, eat breakfast, and walk to school!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, you walked all the way from grandma's house to that
school on the other side of town?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was almost a full mile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were the buses?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no buses. We didn't even have backpacks. We just
carried all 20 of our heavy books in our hands as we trudged
through the rain, sleet, and snow. And if our books got wet, the
teacher would punish us by making us beat the chalk out of the
erasers until we sneezed.''
</P>
<P>
   They start to look skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, you grew up in Fort Worth. It never snows around here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't anymore. They stopped it with those satellites, but
back then it snowed year 'round. Plus, when we got home, we had to
wash the dishes by hand and sweep the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding!?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we had a vacuum cleaner, but it was really heavy.
Sometimes I just swept the carpet with a broom to make it look like
I had vacuumed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, Mom, how did you ever survive without a VCR or video
games?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We read a lot of books and talked to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? That sounds totally boring. Aren't you glad that
things are so much better now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but sometimes I wish for the days when I could run
around in my bare feet all summer long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No kidding? With those feet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooo! That is scary!''

 &HT;    Don't expect Walkin' Lawton to slow down
 &HT;    (Resending to fix garble.)
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Klas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _Just hours before Lawton Chiles was to face
Jeb Bush in the only televised debate of the 1994 governor's race,
the governor of Florida played hooky on his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign staff had assembled at his Tampa hotel with mock
questions to warm him up for a feisty debate against his younger,
more telegenic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiles slipped out for a few hours and got ice cream. It was
vintage Chiles, breaking schedule to give himself some thinking
time and do something he really enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   That night, in what is considered the defining moment of his
final campaign, he delivered this line: ``The old he-coon walks
just before the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people understood what he meant _ he clearly confounded Bush
_ but the phrase crystallized the folk-hero image Chiles had
developed during four decades in public office. The line gave him
new momentum and he defeated Bush in the closest gubernatorial
election ever in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   No Florida politician has captured the imagination of the
electorate longer than Lawton Mainor Chiles Jr., first a state
representative, then a state senator, U.S. senator and, finally,
the state's 41st governor.
</P>
<P>
   His Cracker expressions were foreign to many who understood
little about the ways of old Florida. Yet the same man who wore a
coonskin cap and fired a potato gun at his second inauguration also
used his 1997 State of the State address to call attention to brain
research and the importance of a healthy early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The avid outdoorsman who chews tobacco and hunts turkeys also
spent every ounce of his political capital to fend off a
legislative assault on a state lawsuit against the nation's
cigarette giants. The victory will reap $13 billion for Florida
during the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   When Chiles retires in January at age 68 and hands over his
command to Bush, he will end a 40-year political career that began
when Eisenhower was president and Bush was in first grade. It will
be the end to a job he never expected to have but enjoyed more than
any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 times better than being in the (U.S.) Senate,''
Chiles said recently, referring to the job of his boyhood dreams,
which he quit in 1988 out of frustration. ``The game doesn't start
until you blow the whistle and if you don't like something in the
main ring, you can start something somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was good at starting fights. He forced legislators to
focus on children's issues, government reform, managed care,
welfare reform and tobacco litigation long before most other
politicians were ready to talk about them.
</P>
<P>
   His skills made admirers out of many Republicans, even political
opponents. Florida Republican Party leader Tom Slade called him a
clever strategist whose political timing and instincts are ``the
best I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Smith, former Florida secretary of state who unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1994, believes
Chiles ``will be a legend in Florida politics,'' and, ``because of
the tobacco settlement, will be recognized nationally as a governor
that gave that issue prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chiles never lost an election, he did lose his share of
battles. Faced with a recession in 1991 that forced $2 billion in
budget cuts, Chiles accelerated his government reform efforts and
was compelled to seek tax reform earlier than he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my head handed to me,'' Chiles recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of cronyism pained him
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to abandon a sweeping health insurance reform when
legislators refused to give it a hearing. And his image was
tarnished by multiple allegations of political cronyism and charges
that his 1994 campaign was behind a smear campaign that used
misleading phone calls to senior citizens to frighten them away
from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in what is perhaps the most paradoxical failure, this
popular and influential governor leaves office with his party in
such disrepair that he may be the last Democratic governor for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the last of the true Southern Democrats in
Florida,'' said David Colburn, a history professor at the
University of Florida and a gubernatorial scholar. He believes
Chiles belongs alongside Leroy Collins, Reubin Askew and Bob Graham
as moderate Democrats whose progressive policies and political
skills left lasting change.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiles' shortcoming ``is not recognizing and not doing
enough to ensure his party's viability,'' Colburn said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chiles began his political career in 1958, he registered as
a Democrat out of sheer convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, there was sort of a no-party situation in
Florida,'' Chiles recalled. ``As Republicans slowly became more of
a factor, they were always more disciplined, more organized.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Democrats had no unified message. Their top
officials were elected on the sheer strength of their personality
and often sounded like Republicans. What's more, Democrats had
failed to groom proteges.
</P>
<P>
   So when former U.S. Rep. Buddy MacKay persuaded Chiles in 1990
to step out of retirement and run for governor, the Democratic
dream team was created with recycled talent. Its success delayed
the Republican takeover of Florida government, but did not stop it.
(The Florida Legislature went Republican in 1996 and Bush won the
governor's race this year, signaling the first complete takeover in
more than a century.)
</P>
<P>
   Chiles simply didn't believe that invigorating the party was his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only person that could have had the coordination to
make the organization work,'' said Buzz Ritchie, former House
Democratic leader. ``It wasn't a priority for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Chiles is a study in contrasts. He always seemed aware of
nuances regarding dozens of issues that swirled around him each
day. But he was never able to say much about them spontaneously.
Pundits alternately described him as vague and befuddled or folksy
and charming. All fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Doug Cook, his former Washington aide
whom Chiles named head of his Agency for Health Care
Administration, ``he's not a new-age communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump skit stumped him
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 press skits, an Orlando Sentinel reporter
portrayed Chiles as Forrest Gump, the movie character whose
simpleness was perceived as wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the skit, Rhea Chiles turned to her husband and
whispered: ``Honey, you're Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredulous, Chiles whispered back: ``I'm not that dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea replied: ``You're not that smart either.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles never came across as an intellectual, but most who have
worked with him say he has a swiftness of thought, a shrewd sense
of the public and an understanding of government that made him a
formidable leader.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent rap on Chiles among Tallahassee lobbyists and
lawmakers is that he is detached, uninterested in details. But
those who have worked closely with him say that was how Chiles kept
people from bombarding him with arguments when he wanted those
conversations to be handled by staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has won more than one battle by having someone
underestimate him,'' said Dan Stengle, Chiles' general counsel.
``It doesn't bother him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final State of the State speech in March, Chiles ended
his remarks with this advice: ``The best way to achieve leadership
is to learn more about your subject than anyone else and to work
harder. . . . Be bold _ dare to look foolish. Reach beyond your
grasp and go beyond the path you can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents ingrained values
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was reared during World War II in Lakeland by a father
who worked on the railroad and a deeply religious mother. They
ingrained in him the values that have guided his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles believes that, to follow his faith, he has a spiritual
and moral obligation to serve others, said Cook, his long-time
aide. The governor regularly conducts a Bible class for a small
group of friends and staff, often assigning them readings. And he
keeps a worn, leather-bound Holy Bible in his small, private
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a much more religious man than he ever lets you know,''
said Dexter Douglass, his former law school buddy who was his
general counsel in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's upbringing also inspired a profound sense of
loyalty to his friends, a virtue some of his staff admit has been
his Achilles' heel. His willingness to overlook the faults of his
friends produced some of his most trying days. He was forced to
withdraw the nomination of a hunting buddy and political activist,
Joe Bruner, from the game commission after it was revealed Bruner
had been cited for hunting without a license. He was chided for
accepting dozens of plane rides from friends, most of them hunting
partners, without reporting them as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But his most painful experience was his decision to fire one of
his dearest friends, his chief inspector general, Harold Lewis,
whom he had known since they met at Boys State. The Florida
Department of Law Enforcement had begun investigating Lewis when
questions surfaced about loans between him and a private lawyer
working on the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Firing friend hurt him deeply
</P>
<P>
   The incident ``broke his heart,'' said Mallory Horne, a longtime
friend and adviser to Chiles. ``He just didn't talk about it. It's
like none of that ever existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was one of many longtime friends Chiles hired to work in
the top jobs of his administration. ``He wanted people he could
trust,'' Douglass explained. Public service was the greatest
calling to Chiles, ``He walked the line between total loyalty to
his friends and his loyalty to government.''
</P>
<P>
   When life in Tallahassee got too intense, Chiles would get back
on the road, his staff said, where he learned from his now-famous
walk across the state in 1970 that he could get direction,
inspiration and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have him in the office too long, it shows,'' said April
Herrle, the governor's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes getting on the road meant getting behind the wheel.
Before he was first inaugurated, Chiles was caught going 80 mph in
a 50-mph zone driving his red Sterling through Bainbridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   With Chiles in his old hunting clothes, the officer didn't
believe him when Chiles said he was Florida's new governor. The
officer's response to the news: He gave Chiles a Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many ``car incidents,'' which have prompted
Rhea Chiles to quip: ``I always said he had to start walking
because nobody wanted him to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone so energized by people, Chiles is, by most accounts,
a solitary man.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loner among thousands,'' observed Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Craves solitude of preserve
</P>
<P>
   Chiles spends much of his private time time hunting and fishing,
often at his 209-acre hunting preserve west of Tallahassee, called
Chemonie. The place became somewhat of a pauper's Camp David for
Chiles, a back-to-nature refuge from the relentless demands of the
office, equipped with only a one-room log cabin and a cook shack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like to talk much when he's out there,'' said
Horne, who often accompanied Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   He loves turkey hunting but he won't shoot the turkeys on his
land. When he bags his prey, he is known to put them directly into
the mansion freezer, feathers and all, and is fond of cooking it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite snack is icebox cookies, a spice cookie he insists
be made using his mother's recipe. He also loves coarse grits and
Cuban food. He also acquired an enduring taste for sushi while
serving as an Army artillery officer in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles is best known among his friends as a practical joker for
his famous ``gotchas.'' When President Clinton had dinner at the
mansion, Chiles arranged to have a server return a full plate of
food to the kitchen to make his worried chef think it was the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   And when former press secretary Ron Sachs was losing sleep over
allowing the governor to don a flak jacket in front of television
cameras while touring Miami in the wake of a series of tourist
shootings, Chiles convened a meeting of the state's top law
enforcement officials and had them all wear flak jackets when Sachs
walked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   During eight years as governor, Chiles has remained lean and
lanky. His once-sandy hair is now solidly silver. His round
shoulders have gotten a bit more stooped. He now wears a tiny
hearing aid in his right ear. He is off Prozac, the anti-depressant
he took after leaving the U.S. Senate in a bout of depression. But
he keeps a vigorous schedule that begins at dawn on his stationary
bike and continues long after dark.

<P>
   Chiles has preferred not to speculate on his legacy, except to
say that he hopes politicians will fight over who among them can do
better for children. He and Rhea have bought a home on 40 acres
north of town and renovated it, complete with a bird observation
window.

   Chiles plans to enjoy his last month at the Governor's Mansion.
His four children and their families joined him and Rhea for
Thanksgiving there and the first couple has lined up more than a
dozen goodbye events at the mansion for staff, colleagues and

   He insists he doesn't know what he'll do when he retires. His

DIARIES, PHOTOS BRING INTIMACY TO SURVIVAL TALE OF ENDURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Caroline Alexander happened upon the unbelievable true
story of Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic expedition and, like so many
before her, became enthralled, even obsessed. She read one book on
the expedition, then another, then another, all in growing wonder
at how the entire 28-man expedition managed to endure nearly two
years amid the ice and cold and storms, and still survive.
</P>
<P>
   The pack ice that froze their ship in place did not defeat
Shackleton and his men. Nor did the final crushing of their beloved
144-foot Endurance by the relentless grinding force of the moving
ice. Nor did the tempest-tossed seas they had to cross in three
lifeboats to reach a rocky sliver of land called Elephant Island,
the first ground under their feet in 497 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the hurricane that their stalwart party of six,
including Shackleton, encountered when they set out for help from a
whaling station that was 800 miles away across the most perilous
seas on Earth during the dead of winter, with their only hope for
survival resting on the fate of a 22-foot boat called the James
Caird.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a 42-year-old former Rhodes Scholar, was so moved by
the Shackleton story that she wrote one book for children, from the
perspective of the ship's cat, then convinced the American Museum
of Natural History in New York to mount an exhibition with the
stunning photographs of crew member Frank Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so amazing about the Shackleton expedition,''
Alexander said yesterday in Seattle, ``is this was a real trial by
fire, a visit to the dark night of the soul, the sort of test of
character that almost no one encounters. And yet none of these
randomly selected men came out debased or much worse off than how
they set out. It is a tribute to real human character, something
that would be hard to replicate, or probably impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's immersion in the Shackleton story, which has already
consumed three years of her life, is not about to stop soon. She
has just published a new Shackleton book to accompany the museum
exhibition, and it will be followed by at least a year's work on
writing and co-producing a PBS-TV documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Her new book, ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic
Expedition'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 212 pages, $29.95), is a chilling
and inspiring testament to the instinct for survival and the power
of human unity. Alexander's spare, yet evocative 55,000 words of
prose recapture the expedition in a page-turning narrative with a
distinct late 20th-century sensibility. It is accompanied by the
largest published collection of Hurley's photographs, unforgettable
images of Shackleton and his men, often tiny dark figures on a
great white icescape.
</P>
<P>
   The Shackleton expedition story has been retold many times
before and often very well, including Shackleton's own account,
``South,'' which is considered a classic. And the story will be
told again, not only in the documentary that Alexander is doing,
but also in a film next year directed by Wolfgang Peterson of ``Das
Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the past accounts of Shackleton's 1914-1916
expedition, or possible future accounts, daunted the self-aware
Alexander when she sat down to write her own book at the behest of
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole amazing story _ you approach it with complete
humility, or you don't bother to do anything with it at all,'' she
summarized. ``The story has existed, the facts have existed, so
your task is to assemble from what is there and what you can find.
This story is so epic that I made a determination very early on to
let the story write itself as much as possible. That's why I use
the men's diaries so much instead of paraphrasing them. I had no
illusions about my own role.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alexander's modesty is somewhat misleading. She did manage
to unearth two prime nuggets of new research for her book, an
unpublished diary by one crew member and an unpublished
autobiography by another. And her crusading on behalf of Hurley's
remarkable work is bringing long-overdue attention to
photojournalism performed under the direst personal circumstances
that ultimately produced documentary art.
</P>
<P>
   That the photographer himself had to rescue his glass plate
negatives while bare-chested in 4 feet of icy slush in the dark
hold of the sinking ship only adds to the mythic aura surrounding
the expedition. So does the fact that the negatives were too heavy
to transport across the ice floes, which forced Hurley to spend a
day scanning all his shots and then throwing out 400 of his 520
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unfortunate reduction is essential,'' Hurley wrote in his
diary, a statement displaying the sort of resigned resolve that
Shackleton and his men exhibited, time and again.
</P>
<P>
   One of the particular strengths of Alexander's account is the
way she has captured the entire 28-man expedition, which hoped to
accomplish the first land crossing of Antarctica. She provides
telling portraits of both the famous and the little remembered,
from Shackleton to Buenos Aires stowaway Perce Blackborow to
Hurley, who had been enlisted to provide photos and movie film for
later commercial exploitation of the expedition, including lecture
tours and books.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton emerges as a textbook leader, strong-willed and
savvy, yet always acutely attuned to the needs of the others. But
the expedition's survival also depended upon its lowliest members,
who weathered extreme conditions that sometimes left them on the
verge of madness, but with surprisingly little complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Those left on Elephant Island endured seven months in frigid
temperatures wearing the same sodden clothes, existing on a diet of
almost nothing but penguin, and still they kept their daily routine
despite dwindling hopes of ever being rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander often found herself beset by tears during her
research, including her visit to the impossibly tiny James Caird.
But nothing affected her more than the word from a library in New
Zealand that one of the key crew members, carpenter Henry McNish,
had died a pauper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened that envelope,'' Alexander recalled, ``and I felt
like I had opened a telegram from the war front telling me that
someone in my own family had died. I was just devastated.''

HOW CLINTON'S CUTENESS UNDERMINES THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The comment jarred me.
</P>
<P>
   It was made by a lawyer representing one of two Albany police
officers accused of beating up a suspect in handcuffs. The initial
charges had been thrown out on a technicality. John Dorfman, the
special prosecutor in the case, had managed to get a judge to
essentially reinstate the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman, the defense lawyer said, was behaving in an evil,
vindictive way by pursuing this case. Do you know who Dorfman
reminded the lawyer of? Kenneth Starr, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful. Apparently, from now on, whenever a prosecutor does
his job vigorously _ whenever a prosecutor does anything but roll
over and play dead in any criminal case _ he can expect to be
likened to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   With a shaky Congress trying desperately to find some way not to
impeach Bill Clinton, an image has popped into my mind that I
haven't been able to shake. It's a picture of Richard Nixon, gazing
up from Hell at Washington, D.C., shaking his head and muttering to
himself, ``How is this guy pulling this off?''
</P>
<P>
   Through a masterful manipulation of public opinion, that's how.
Clinton has successfully managed to divert attention from what he
did to the conduct of the independent counsel. To a startling
degree, public debate on this from the beginning has focused not on
whether the president committed a felony _ and he did; I saw him do
it on television _ but on whether Starr is a good guy or a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Clinton's good fortune has been to have enemies viewed
by most Americans as mean and weird. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., for
example. Here's this vengeful, sanctimonious geek from somewhere
out in the boonies. He's howling about the president's immorality
while, it turns out, he fathered an illegitimate child in an
illicit affair of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With enemies like that, who needs friends?
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's surly paranoia and utter paucity of personal warmth made
almost everybody nervous, even those who agreed with his politics.
But Clinton is a shrewd, calculating, matchless charmer. He's a
good-looking guy with a nice smile and a spectacular line of
bullfeathers. Few see in him the dark, brooding malice that
virtually everybody saw in Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton is getting away with the purposeful
commission of perjury _ with lying under oath not once but twice.
To most people, the gravity of this crime counts far less than the
warm and fuzzy public persona of the man who committed it compared
to the sinister, worrisome images of the men who condemn him for
it.
</P>
<P>
   We're watching the ultimate political spin job. To somebody like
me, who has spent most of a lifetime watching spin jobs, this
operation's effectiveness is nothing less than breathtaking. Nobody
would have bought a used car from Nixon, but Clinton could make
millions peddling old Yugos.
</P>
<P>
   I've never had a big political problem with this guy. Sure, I
have specific complaints, but he's basically a
middle-of-the-roader, and so am I. Like the framers of the
Constitution, though, despotism worries me. There's little doubt in
my mind that James Madison, for example, would have voted to bounce
Clinton for perjury just as Madison would have voted to oust Nixon
for obstruction of justice and Lyndon Johnson for lying to Congress
about the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison formed his values before television and 401(k)
accounts, before greed and a public passion for cuddliness
overpowered conscience, before charm and cant trumped principles.
Cute now counts more than right.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, I expect, any prosecutor lacking a towering level
of charisma can expect to be painted as a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the guy accused of the crime.
</P>

 &HT;    ONLINE DRAFT REGISTRATION BEGINS WEDNESDAY
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Proving that the times they are a-changing yet
again, four suburban high school seniors will race on computer
keyboards Wednesday to become the first young men to register on
line with the Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Vietnam War era, when Bob Dylan sang protest songs
and the military draft haunted a generation of American men, hardly
anyone was in a hurry to sign up with the Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 25 years since the last draftee entered the army,
though, and the young men who will register at the Selective
Service's Internet site (http://www.sss.gov) have known only the
all-volunteer military services. At a time where the PC is
universal and the VC exists only in history books, the new system
should make it easier to comply with federal requirements to
register.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real, interactive, online registration,'' said Gil
Coronado, director of the Selective Service. ``For nearly two
decades, men have gone to post offices, completed and mailed a
registration form, and waited 60 to 90 days to receive an
acknowledgement card from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men can still register through the mail, but there is now a
better way,'' he said. This ``better way'' will be demonstrated
Wednesday morning by four 18-year-old male students at George Mason
High School in Falls Church, Va., a suburb of the nation's capital.
After Coronado throws a switch symbolically activating the Internet
system, the young men will race on personal computers to become the
nation's first cyber-registrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new online service, a man with a valid Social
Security number will be able to connect to the Selective Service
Web site, ... link to the agency's computers, type in his
registration information, click on the 'Submit' button which
appears on the screen, and instantly be given his Selective Service
number,'' said Coronado.
</P>
<P>
   The online registrants will also receive a formal
acknowledgement postcard in the mail within two weeks, said the
director.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all male citizens and many male aliens living in the
United States are required to register with the Selective Service,
an independent federal agency created by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in 1940 to oversee the military draft. The law requires
young men to register with 30 days of their 18th birthday, and
about 1.8 million sign up with the Selective Service each year.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to register is a felony and causes young men to be
ineligible for student loans and grants for college, for federal
jobs and for federal job training.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the draft ended and the nation converted to an
all-volunteer military force. The registration requirement was
suspended in 1975, but resumed in 1980 and has been the law ever
since _ although no American has been conscripted in a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the past year, recruitment and retention of
personnel have become a problem in the military, and there has been
talk in Congress about a potential need to revive the draft. With
the services not meeting their quotas, the draft was discussed at a
September hearing of a House National Security subcommittee on
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The draft filled the ranks of America's armed forces during the
major wars of the 20th century. About 2.7 million men were inducted
during World War I, 10.1 million in World War II, 1.5 million
during the Korean War and 1.7 during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado said online registration represents ``a historic
milestone for the Selective Service System.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As increasing numbers of men gain access to the Internet
through home computers, in schools, at libraries and many other
places that are connected to the Web, we hope that online
registration becomes the primary method of registering,'' said
Coronado. ``It is faster, simpler and easier for all concerned.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 ORLANDO, Fla.: ... new information.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing they have heard has heartened them. In fact, psychic
Sylvia Brown of Seattle, who appeared with the families on ``The
Montel Williams Show,'' has said the men are underwater, killed
with a guide in an airboat accident in the northwest Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The guide was a hermit without family and friends, the psychic
said, and the GMC Jimmy will not be found because the guide's
cabin, where the vehicle is parked, is so remote.
</P>
<P>
   Because DesVergnes owns an airboat, Ray has seized on this
vision and prodded police to search the Everglades and area lakes.
</P>
<P>
   But to Bergin, the suggestion is preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 300 lakes in central Florida,'' she said.
``Where do I start? I can't search the state of Florida. I can't
make those people happy right now because I have limitations on
what I can reasonably do. They have no idea from our point of view
about what is practical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, members of all three families are accepting the idea
that the men are dead. But without any bodies, a faint hope
continues to flicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the situation, and you say they're probably no
longer alive. But on the other hand, who really knows?'' said
Poillucci, Nelson's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had been expected to attend another sister's wedding in
Warwick, R.I., on Oct. 4, two days after his scheduled return.
Nelson missed the rehearsal dinner on Oct. 3, but his absence did
not alarm relatives who suspected he had spent an extra day in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nelson did not appear at the wedding, where his son
served as ringbearer, concern began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cloud hung over the wedding,'' Poillucci said. ``We were all
wondering what happened, but tried not to show it. You know, it's
supposed to be the best day in my sister's life. So how do you put
her in a panic on her wedding day?''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ray became alarmed when DesVergnes' once-a-day
calls from Florida stopped. When he did not return to
Massachusetts, Ray called Renquin's parents, whom she had never
met, to share her worries.
</P>
<P>
   Renquin's mother relayed the news to Paul, her oldest son, and
he reacted with an unworried shrug born of the knowledge that
sometimes, even men can be unpredictable boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `Do you know your brother's missing?''' Paul
Renquin recalled. ``I said, `Huh? So what? He's a single guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the seeds of concern had been planted, and the Renquins
called the Orlando police the next day to ask for a check of the
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the lives of the families have been irrevocably
changed. ``It's taxing my family terribly,'' Renquin said. ``It's
the most stressful situation I've ever been in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute you're saying, `I'd do anything to get him back.'
And the next minute, you're saying, `The S.O.B., why did he do
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renquin's mother, agonizing over her son's fate, is wracked by
sudden nausea at work. Ray clings to a prayer that she and
DesVergnes can marry next October as planned. And Poillucci wonders
what will become of her brother's small son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's maybe a one-quarter of 1 percent chance that he'll
walk through that door,'' Paul Renquin said at his home, stroking
Scott's black cat, Voodoo. ``But the family needs to have closure.
That's what's tearing us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Scott Renquin's apartment in Attleboro awaits a
tenant who may never return. When his brother broke in, he found a
handwritten note among the bachelor furnishings that included
Nintendo games and a beer keg hooked up to a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The note read: ``If anything was ever to happen to me when I'm
away, then everything I own is to be left to my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma about what to do with Scott's belongings is just one
of many wrenching problems for the Renquins _ and for relatives of
the other missing men.
</P>
<P>
   Active searches have stopped in Florida, and the next
development in the case will probably be a grim one.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a Providence TV station interrupted its noon
newscast to carry the live broadcast of a van being pulled from a
lake near Orlando. Commentators speculated that the vehicle might
be carrying the bodies of the Attleboro men.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Renquin rushed into his home from the adjacent garage where
he repairs BMW and Mercedes automobiles. As he watched, anxious
with anticipation, a rising hope turned to crashing disappointment
when the vehicle was not his brother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went back to my shop,'' Renquin recalled. ``By that
point, I was pretty much disgusted. I thought, `Is this the way I'm
going to have to find out?'''

<P>
   The arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet is serving a
purpose, far beyond warming the hearts of the thousands of friends,
relatives and colleagues of his victims _ men and women who have
waited nearly a quarter of a century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention reveals many of the contradictions and deeper truths
about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic rule, and
how they settle scores with a past that never should have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving their departure and the overall dismantling of their
regimes, as of one-party systems, implied providing them with a way
out: a safe departure, to a safe haven, for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of amnesty or
tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a desire to
know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never Again Commissions,
White Books and the like were created and supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the understanding always was that the personal safety and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the deal in Chile, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in a
certain sense initially in Nicaragua, in South Korea, South Africa
and even in some places in eastern Europe. It was formal and
institutionalized in some cases, de facto in others, but it made
democracy possible. It seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too
bitter to swallow, a necessary and sufficient condition for moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? With whom did the political leaders consult? How freely did
the leaders and the led consent to the agreements and how well
informed were the countries' citizens? Would the arrangements
withstand international and historical scrutiny, particularly of a
passionate and critical nature? Would the amnesties resist the test
of time, further investigations and new revelations?
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, amid the tensions and discomfort of all the
political parties and even of two old friends and heroes who are
true role models for transitions everywhere: Nelson Mandela and
Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for disenchantment with the South African
commission's report, one clearly stands out. The idea that inspired
its creation was that the spirit of national reconciliation guiding
the shift from apartheid to majority rule in South Africa should
also prevail in dealing with the country's past. But this is no
longer as relevant or widespread as when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
   What then seemed fair, prudent and tolerant, today appears
callous and cynical. What today is deemed unacceptable and
insensitive then felt cautious and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly for Mexico. The country is painfully, desperately,
slowly proceeding with its move toward democratic rule, and while
settling scores with the past is certainly not the most pressing
task, it is one of the most delicate ones. From the student
massacre in Tlatelocolo in 1968 to the localized ``dirty war'' of
the 1970s to the electoral fraud of the 1980s and the corruption of
the 1990s, the legendary ruling party has a great deal to answer
for.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile and elsewhere, many believe, sincerely, that the best
solution is to bury the past, the dead and the bank accounts _ and
move forward. Others think that some degree of accountability and
punishment is indispensable to ensure that impunity cease being a
leitmotif of political life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really knows the cost of each option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable. The Chilean precedent confounds everyone willing to
think the matter through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chile has left its friends and its people perplexed,
perhaps undeservedly. For the past decade, the conventional wisdom
about the country was simple. Moderation and sensibility had
prevailed, national reconciliation had been achieved, successful
economic policies had been pursued. The past decades of
revolutionary turmoil and bloody repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he is
still the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this
split of opinion, and for the rest of the world to begin to grasp
that dealing with the past is a very complicated matter, and that
easy solutions, as brisk and painless as they may seem, generally
do not work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

<P>
   The arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet is serving a
purpose, far beyond warming the hearts of the thousands of friends,
relatives and colleagues of his victims _ men and women who have
waited nearly a quarter of a century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention reveals many of the contradictions and deeper truths
about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic rule, and
how they settle scores with a past that never should have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving their departure and the overall dismantling of their
regimes, as of one-party systems, implied providing them with a way
out: a safe departure, to a safe haven, for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of amnesty or
tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a desire to
know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never Again Commissions,
White Books and the like were created and supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the understanding always was that the personal safety and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the deal in Chile, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in a
certain sense initially in Nicaragua, in South Korea, South Africa
and even in some places in eastern Europe. It was formal and
institutionalized in some cases, de facto in others, but it made
democracy possible. It seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too
bitter to swallow, a necessary and sufficient condition for moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? With whom did the political leaders consult? How freely did
the leaders and the led consent to the agreements and how well
informed were the countries' citizens? Would the arrangements
withstand international and historical scrutiny, particularly of a
passionate and critical nature? Would the amnesties resist the test
of time, further investigations and new revelations?
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, amid the tensions and discomfort of all the
political parties and even of two old friends and heroes who are

WELFARE REFORM: IT'S A NEW DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG AND FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In dry print, tucked in the pages of a dictionary
between ``weightless'' and ``well-born,'' the definition sounds as
plain as it is innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare: ``The state of being or doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years after a New Deal president created a system to
rescue ``unemployables,'' welfare continues to generate the
fiercest debate over how, and whether, a democratic society should
care for its own. Now, after all the good intentions and bad ideas,
the political attack and public outrage, it comes down to this.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``new deal,'' and, for as many as 5,800 families in
Massachusetts, a single day of reckoning: Dec. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after Thanksgiving, and four weeks before Christmas,
the welfare rolls were to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's vow to ``end welfare as we know it''
becomes a reality in Massachusetts, state officials will eliminate
cash benefits for families who have been receiving benefits for two
consecutive years, as part of a welfare overhaul some advocates say
is among the strictest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plan will spare the disabled and those whose youngest
child has not yet reached age 2, the plan means an end to monthly
checks for any family headed by an able-bodied parent once the
youngest child reaches the age of 4.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 41,000 recipients who initially faced the
deadline, the ticking of the two-year clock of welfare reform was
deafening. The vast majority moved off the rolls, about half of
them for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With the number down to 5,800 at the end of October, the
question, welfare officials and advocates say, is as much who they
are as why they have been unable to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Those who clamored for rigid reforms are betting that the
remainder of people left to face the deadline are the chronically
dependent who have no motivation to work. But advocates who have
been helping still-struggling recipients brace for the final day
warn that the deadline may leave behind a population of recipients
so troubled or needy, they may be impervious to even the state's
strict hand of reform.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; No one is certain whether the final cutoff will spur those who
remain to self-improvement, or relegate them to the desperate
poverty that welfare was originally created to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-six percent of the 5,800 are actively doing something
_ working, in education and training or in structured job
searches,'' said state welfare commissioner Claire McIntire. ``We
expect those families will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rest, McIntire said, are doing nothing. And what happens
to them will tell much of the story about how the massive social
experiment to overhaul welfare ended.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture of the thousands facing the deadline is a
portrait of paradoxes that defies easy characterization. On one
hand, the picture reveals an older population that tends to be
better educated than the overall pool of recipients. They are more
likely to be working in part-time jobs, but they are also more
likely to be living in subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   It also points to another, more vulnerable subset: the poorest
of the poor, uneducated, and unskilled, who face serious obstacles
to employment, from language, literacy, and cultural barriers to
poor work experience. They confront those obstacles without the
buffer of relatives or additional support systems that might
otherwise fill gaps in child care and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that critical layer of support may be the only thing
separating the so-called working poor _ who manage to keep their
families afloat _ from those who depend on a government check.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say, `There's no excuse. There are plenty of
people out there who are working and making it who don't have great
jobs,''' said Conny Doty, director of Boston's Office of Jobs and
Community Services. The agency offers training and education for
children and adults, including welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``But I guarantee you almost every single one of those people
who are making it have a family support system that is taking care
of child care, which is a major issue,'' Doty said. ``It's not as
easy as just saying `Get a job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were that easy, some, like Malikkah Phillips, could
not make it.
</P>
<P>
   When House Speaker Newt Gingrich pledged four years ago to do
whatever he had to to ``help, cajole, lure or force adults off
welfare,'' he was not talking about Phillips. A 26-year-old single
mother of four who lives in Dorchester and has been on welfare
since 1989, Phillips resolved months ago to spend her last two
years building a ladder that eventually would help her climb to a
higher level of earning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the crush of a deadline, she has found no wages, and
no window of opportunity either.
</P>
<P>
   Taking long strides as she marched through commencement at
Bunker Hill Community College this spring, she felt the world of
dependence she had entered at age 17, two years after she had her
first child, would soon be behind her. She was counting on the
human services associate's degree to help her land the
$9.50-per-hour job she felt she would need to support herself and
her family. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After mailing out 300 resumes in four months and going to 50 job
interviews, she has not had a single offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them told me to come back when I get a bachelor's
degree or get more experience,'' said Phillips, who planned to take
a seasonal retail job at $6.50 per hour. ``People think I can find
a job anywhere, but that is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips lives in subsidized housing, which means the government
would pay her entire rent if she has no income after losing her
$702 monthly welfare check. But that hardly makes her secure. Once
the grant stops coming, she will have to scrape together $315 each
month to keep her apartment heated, the lights on, and the phone
connected. She will also have to figure out how to supplement the
$318 she gets each month in food stamps to pay for her family's
$600 monthly grocery expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures put Phillips in a broad category with many
recipients like herself who may not have to worry about paying
rent, but will have utility and food bills that welfare grants once
helped them pay. Indeed, a recent report by the US General
Accounting Office suggested that residents of public housing were
less likely to move off the rolls because they face more barriers
to finding jobs than the larger welfare population.
</P>
<P>
   The missing links of her welfare story Phillips chooses not to
talk about _ the absent father, the missing relatives _ tells as
much of the story of struggle she and others face as the hard
numbers.

LIFE IMITATES TV AS BATHROOMS GO UNISEX  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From profit sharing to potty sharing, the path to corporate
enlightenment takes many strange twists. In the case of a company
in Bristol, Conn., employees _ sorry, associates _ will soon see
whether real life and the television version are truly compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Yarde Metals, a privately owned 300-employee metals distribution
firm, has made news lately with its plans to install a unisex
bathroom in the company's new office facility, slated to be built
in the spring. The concept, which is to include six stalls and a
shared sink area but no urinals, is an unabashed rip-off of ``Ally
McBeal,'' the hit Fox TV show in which a gender-blended restroom
figures heavily in the weekly plot gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside about life imitating art, though, or about
what passes for art on network television these days, Yarde Metals
founder and president Craig Yarde is dead serious when he tells
media heavyweights like The New York Times that the flush handle
could become the next potent symbol of male-female equality in the
already-confused American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an `Ally McBeal' fan, I love that show,'' says Yarde, 47.
``But I also really believe that everyone who works here is equal
and should be treated that way. Even when it comes to the bathroom,
as quirky as that sounds. How many times have you gone into the
restroom and had a discussion about what's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   Having already eliminated designated parking spaces and private
walled offices _ even the term ``employee'' was dropped for the
more status-neutral ``associate'' _ Yarde maintains that it fits
with his philosophy to offer men and women adjoining toilet stalls
as an option. Not the only option, to be sure; men's and women's
restrooms will also be available. But a visible, viable,
McBeal-able option that merges plumbing and human behavior with
postmodern management philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig does a lot of wacky things, but he also walks the walk
when it comes to progressivism,'' says company vice president Brad
Urban, 59. ``To me, as far as unisex restrooms go, what's the
difference anyway? I have one at home. My wife might not be as open
to using one here, but so what? Most women probably wouldn't. I
look at it like doing business at men's clubs or on the golf
course. You have to start breaking those barriers down, and not
everyone jumps on the idea at first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd use it as long as there are no frogs in there,'' jokes
Ginny Aiken, 38, referring to the show's amphibians. ``Seriously,
it doesn't bother me. I'd actually like to find out what the guys
talk about in there.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do the women of Yarde Metals talk about in the privacy
of their own privy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The men, of course,'' says Aiken. Not everyone is what you
might call in sync with Yarde's vision. In Tewksbury, where Yarde
Metals maintains a satellite office, Dawn Sullivan votes a
resounding ``no'' on this little piece of social engineering, which
she regards as touchy-feely management run amok.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's asinine, no pun intended,'' says Sullivan, 41, a
member of the sales support team. ``I told my boss, `If you put one
of those in, I'm driving home to go to the bathroom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cerat, 44, a sales associate, says Yarde customers have
been chortling over the publicity about the unisex. Like Sullivan,
he's no fan of the experiment and believes that it flies in the
face of human nature _ and especially human nature with its
knickers down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't get the concept _ or the benefit.'' He says if
he's using the toilet and ``a woman wants to come in, ... I suppose
that's her business. But is it really a place they want to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Cerat notes another toilet truism that he says argues for
separate facilities. ``In my experience, guys don't talk much in
the john. Most men like their privacy. Women tend to travel more in
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he says, Yarde Metals is hardly the kind of company
where people have to hide in the bathroom to talk about the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Young, 35, a Yarde telephone operator and the spouse of
another company employee, counts herself among the curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shy, I'd check it out,'' she says. ``I'd see who goes
in there to talk, maybe. Although there's not a lot of gossipy talk
that goes on in the women's room, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarde is, if you'll forgive the expression, plunging ahead just
the same. And unisex toilets aren't the only controversial aspects
of his blueprint. Those eight proposed nap rooms for employees are
drawing attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think this way at Harvard Business School,'' says
Yarde, whose staff may soon face another key business question:
whether to leave the seat up or down.

HEALTH EXPERTS URGE AWARENESS ABOUT HEPATITIS C

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A blood test may have saved Lucy's life.
</P>
<P>
   That's not her real name, but the story of this nurse in upstate
New York is true. Last year, after a routine physical and blood
test, Lucy's doctor discovered she had elevated liver enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   Further tests showed hepatitis C, a liver infection that can
lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. Hepatitis C
kills an estimated 10,000 people annually and is the leading reason
for liver transplants in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would lay awake at night thinking about how I was going to
die,'' Lucy, 41, said from her home near Albany. ``It was unnerving
to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a year later, Lucy is responding well to treatment, a
regimen of regular injections of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Some people aren't so lucky. Hepatitis C afflicts an estimated
3.9 million Americans, many of whom don't know they're infected
with the potentially fatal virus. The leading cause of infection is
sharing intravenous drug needles, but anyone who came into contact
with infected blood before 1992, including through blood
transfusions or organ transplants, is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy believes she contracted the disease on the job as a health
care worker, before the virus was identified. She didn't want her
real name used in this article because of the potential stigma. ``I
don't want to have to defend myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall, health officials announced a plan to start
notifying people who may be at risk: Their goal is to encourage the
hundreds of thousands of Americans who had transfusions or
transplants before 1992, to get tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what we know, it's appropriate to tell people they're
at risk,'' said Dr. John Balint, director of the Center for Medical
Ethics and professor of medicine at the Albany Medical College.
Most people don't give their liver a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it for granted, because it quietly does what it has to
do,'' Balint said. ``When the liver gets sick, a lot of things can
go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy agrees. Since her diagnosis, she has developed a new
appreciation for the liver's important role in keeping us healthy.
``It just does its job silently until it stops doing it and then
you're out of luck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Balint likens the liver to a chemical factory, with the job of
manufacturing products the body can use and detoxifying those it
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is only one of a class of three hepatitis viruses
that can affect liver function.
</P>
<P>
   If your mother has told you to stay away from raw shellfish,
she's worried about hepatitis A, the least serious of the viruses.
</P>
<P>
   It thrives in fecal matter, and is passed on from person to
person through contaminated food and water. Eating raw shellfish
can be a problem, if it's harvested from waters containing raw
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The best precaution is to eat only food that's been fully cooked
and boiled. However, beware that most shellfish are cooked only
until they open, usually at a temperature less than boiling. ``If
you don't know for sure where it was caught, you need to be
careful,'' Balint said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is hepatitis B, a liver virus that is
spread through sexual contact and also through sharp instruments
contaminated with infected blood, including razors, toothbrushes
and needles.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 people contract hepatitis B each year and
nearly all recover within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are vaccines against both hepatitis A and B.
Many states now require children to be immunized against hepatitis
B.
</P>
<P>
   To date, no vaccine is available against hepatitis C. That means
the best defense is early testing and treatment, if you think
you're at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy believes it helped save her life. ``So far, I'm doing
pretty good,'' she said.

`MRS. MINIVER' YEARNED TO BE MISS MISCHIEF

A ROSE FOR MRS. MINIVER 
The Life of Greer Garson 
By Michael Troyan 
University Press of Kentucky, 463 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are reasons that Greer Garson, queen of the MGM lot in the
'40s, faded so quickly from America's collective memory. Katharine
Hepburn, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, and other
divas of the period are remembered and celebrated for their strong
personalities, their combativeness. Instead of rolling with the
punches, they punched back _ publicly. But as the title of Michael
Troyan's new biography, ``A Rose for Mrs. Miniver,'' reaffirms,
Garson was perceived as strong, gallant, refined, quietly enduring.
She won an Oscar for ``Mrs. Miniver'' in 1943, embodying the
stubborn but decorous preservation of self-sacrificing British
civilization at a time when Hitler's aircraft were trying to bomb
it into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   There actually was a rose named after Mrs. Miniver, whom author
Jan Struther had made the personification of British steadiness and
decency. (Struther took the name Miniver, in fact, from English
heraldry, where it refers to the white trim on robes.) The world
needed a Mrs. Miniver figure and Garson became it. Later, she
regarded the role as having stunted her career. Gregory Peck called
her an Irish cut-up, but this was a side seen by comparatively few.
Although one of her early roles was that of Jane Austen's Elizabeth
Bennet in ``Pride and Prejudice'' (opposite Laurence Olivier), and
though she brought to it the right edgy cleverness, the die was
pretty much cast with Garson's first film, ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips,''
in which she played another forbearing Englishwoman, Mrs. Chips, to
Robert Donat's beloved headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   It was a role she didn't want; she unflatteringly described
Katherine Chipping as a sparrow of a woman. But she was impatient,
ambitious, and almost desperate, having been subjected to the kind
of treatment all too common with Louis B. Mayer. Seeing Garson play
a murderess on the London stage, he signed her and whisked her and
her mother (and near-lifelong companion and solace), Nina, to
Pasadena in 1937. There they sat for almost three years. Her screen
test was unprepossessing _ though during it she met the actor who
was to become her favorite leading man over the years, Walter
Pidgeon, who projected his own brand of warmth and dignity to
provide counterpoint to hers.
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Chips it was. Then, after ``Mrs. Miniver'' opposite
Pidgeon, it was ``Random Harvest'' with Ronald Colman. A star was
born, and so was a persona. Ironically, Garson had made her British
stage debut in an American play, Edgar Rice's ``Street Scene,'' in
1932. And though she told people she was Irish, she actually was
born in London, in 1904, and had as much Scottish ancestry as Irish
(Scandinavian, too). Greer, her mother's last name, was an Irish
contraction for the Scottish MacGregor. Garson loved Ireland, where
she spent summers on her relatives' farm in County Down. And one is
surprised to learn of a woman who lived to be 92 (she died in 1996)
that Garson was a sickly child, whose survival was a tossup, and
whose career and other anxieties invariably affected her health.
</P>
<P>
   She not only had style, she had brains. She graduated from the
University of London, worked in advertising, made her first
theatrical connection _ with the Birmingham Repertory Company _
through an agency acquaintance. After seeing her in a production of
his ``Too Good to Be True,'' George Bernard Shaw called her the new
Ellen Terry. Her quick tongue was not always appreciated in
Hollywood. When MGM starred her opposite returning war veteran
Clark Gable in ``Adventure'' in 1946, she was furious to see
posters saying, ``Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him!'' ```They're
ungallant,' she indignantly replied. `Why don't you say, ``Garson
puts the able in Gable''?'''
</P>
<P>
   Troyan's diligent, solidly researched account is punctuated by
Garson's attempts to break out of her dignified persona. She almost
never did. When her career entered its final phases, she was cast
as Eleanor Roosevelt in ``Sunrise at Campobello,'' as a prioress in
``The Singing Nun,'' and as Fred MacMurray's wife in ``The Happiest
Millionaire.'' Two early marriages failed, including one with
Richard Ney, a younger actor who played her son in ``Mrs.
Miniver.'' In 1949, she married a third time. This one, to a Texas
oilman, Buddy Fogelson, lasted until his death, in 1987. They
mostly divided their time between Dallas and Santa Fe, where she
helped establish a theater that was named after her. In Dallas, as
in Hollywod, tea with Greer Garson became something of a state
occasion. ```Gracious' is a word that has haunted me all my life,''
said the woman who wanted to be known as mischievous.

 BOSTON: ... the hard numbers.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris's struggle is so private, she did not want to use her last
name. The mother of two, who lives in Sagamore, thought that after
two years on welfare, she would finally leave it this fall. She
started working for $10.50 per hour as a home health aide in
September, and her 7-year-old son _ who had witnessed his
now-absent father whip his mother with cords and push soiled
diapers into her face _ was doing fairly well with counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within days of starting her job, she began getting calls
from her son's school. Her son was out of control, they told her.
She needed to come and fetch him.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came more and more frequently until finally, last
month, she felt she had no choice but to quit her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to work and I was making good money,'' she said.
``But with all the stuff going on with my son, it was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris has no answer to the question of what she will do when the
checks stop coming. She has a live-in boyfriend who has no steady
work, and no government subsidy to help her pay for the $600
monthly rent on her apartment. And, like the majority of families
on welfare, she gets no child support from the father of her two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the people we work with to help place in work programs, a
lot of them don't have high school credentials, they can have a
poor working history, problems with drug abuse or violence, and a
whole host of other issues,'' said Nancy Snyder, deputy director of
the Private Industry Council.
</P>
<P>
   The organization works with the city, regional companies, and
community-based organizations to place welfare recipients in job
programs and provide counseling and case management for the first
year after recipients find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to these people, you can sense that they really
want to work,'' Snyder said. ``But they always have at least one
kid, and some have as many as six or seven, and the biggest
question for them is their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, those who have watched the effects of the
looming welfare deadline say it has spurred most parents to action.
But while many continue to walk a tightrope _ balancing low wages,
high rents, lack of child care and health insurance, irresponsible
partners, violence, and sometimes drug abuse _ there are others who
seem unfazed by the coming changes.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Stewart is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has lived in public housing in South Boston since 1983.
She has been on welfare for six of those years, after she was laid
off from a job at a print shop. Though she has yet to find a
permanent job, she seemed unrattled that the checks that have
sustained her and her two children will soon stop coming.
</P>
<P>
   Her relative calm in the face of the impending deadline comes in
part from the fact that, even if Stewart does not find a job after
losing her grant, the 36-year-old and her children will still have
their home. Their food stamp allotment of $192 a month will likely
be adjusted upward and they will still be covered by Medicaid. The
end of the $525 monthly welfare check she gets would be largely
offset, because the state would grant her the entire $416 per month
she gets from the children's father in child support. The state, as
a matter of policy, gives families on welfare $50 of child support
payments, keeping the rest to offset the cost of the welfare
grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be just the same as I am concerned,'' said Stewart
matter-of-factly of how her family's life would change after being
dropped from the welfare rolls. ``It will be difficult. It's
difficult now.''
</P>
<P>
   If the system of welfare has not lived up to its definition _
being or doing well _ neither has much of the public debate about
the policy or its overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   At its most fevered pitch, the controversy around a flawed
system has spawned its own stereotypes. The ghetto girlfriend, food
stamps in one fist, Cadillac keys in the other. The drifting,
able-bodied drunk, huddled over street gates but never standing in
an unemployment line. &UR;  &LR; The images contain kernels of truth, but
many say they have clouded the complex issues that feed the welfare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after all the truths, myths, and guesses, there will
finally be an accounting of what kinds of welfare recipients emerge
beyond the stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say the deadline spells certain doom for
some families, thrusting already desperate people into poverty,
onto the streets, back into the arms of abusive partners, and into
criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are going to have to do what they have to do,'' said
Randy Albeda, a University of Massachusetts professor of economics
specializing in low-wage and welfare issues. ``They are going to
take care of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeda predicted the deadline also will leave some parents
unable to adequately feed, clothe, and look after their children,
leaving them open to charges of abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the number of recipients who have left the rolls
proves there is a job for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe if you want to work, there is a job for
you,'' said McIntire. ``There are help wanted ads everywhere. Two
part-time jobs might work as well as one full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To McIntire, there is no reason why every current welfare
recipient cannot be a Marlene Wynter, a 25-year-old Dorchester
success story once considered among the hard-to-serve.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout who had been on welfare for five years
since the birth of the first of her two children, Wynter was in the
first class to graduate from the welfare-to-work training program
at the Copley Marriott in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She has been &UR;  &LR; employed full time since September as a
$9.50-per-hour housekeeper. &UR;  &LR; The thing that prompted her, she said,
was the barrage of mail from the welfare department, pointing her
toward job programs and warning her about the ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really better off now,'' Wynter said. ``I sleep well. I'm
not thinking about welfare anymore, worrying about being cut off. I
feel good about myself. ''
</P>
<P>
   With a monthly salary of nearly $1,500, Wynter is earning almost
double the $718 a month in cash assistance and food stamps she had
been receiving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Wynter has also been lucky. Her mother has been able to
look after Wynter's children while she works 3:30 p.m. to midnight,
a shift most daycare providers could not accommodate, and a luxury
that many single mothers struggling to get off welfare dream of.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of state child-care vouchers, which will still be
available to recipients after the deadline, advocates for the poor
say the vouchers are often useless because there are so few
available slots, and because those that are available do not allow
parents to work odd shifts or in jobs where they are far away from
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Already some say the ultimate test of the state's, and the
nation's, commitment to welfare-to-work lies in the state cutting
another set of long rolls _ waiting lists for day care that is
affordable and convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to find good child care even if you have a lot
of money. So you can imagine what it's like if all you have is a
state voucher,'' said Doty, of the Office of Jobs and Community
Services. ``Child care is a major issue. It's just so clearly
linked to people being in and staying in the work force. And that
just keeps coming up every time you talk to people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The Sunshine Resort is a pink-and-white oasis in
a monotonous jumble of fast-food restaurants, franchise
storefronts, and algae-covered drainage ditches.
</P>
<P>
   Its four pastel floors face the optimistically named Fun Spot, a
cramped amusement park whose relentless pop music bounces off the
Sunshine's timeshare condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Renquin of Attleboro, Mass., a part owner of Room 105, was
seen here Sept. 28, three days after arriving in Florida with two
Attleboro friends for a week of relaxation and outdoor adventure.
</P>
<P>
   They have not been seen since. In a city where nearly every
missing person is eventually found, Renquin, 35; Dan Nelson, 32;
and Roger DesVergnes, 31, have vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any clues, any credible leads, and any evidence
that the men had staged their own disappearance has anguished their
large families back home and baffled seasoned investigators here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how we're going to find them,'' said Orlando
Police Detective Barbara Bergin, who is in charge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   For the men's relatives and friends, that thinking is
unacceptable. To them, three responsible adults do not vanish near
the world's most popular tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   But to police in Orlando, what may seem logical in metropolitan
Boston does not necessarily apply in the boomtowns and scrubland of
central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our growth, we still have wilderness,'' said Jim
Solomons, spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's office. ``There
are places where you can disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergin suspects that the men had an accident in a remote area,
possibly while driving the all-terrain 1999 GMC Jimmy that Renquin
rented for the week. Foul play is highly unlikely, she said; most
killers in the Orlando area ``don't take the time to dispose of
bodies. And it would take quite a bit of time and energy to dispose
of three bodies and a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing men, all single, do not seem to have had lifestyles
that would intersect with deadly criminals. Renquin, who towed cars
in Attleboro &UR;  &LR; with a self-built flatbed truck, enjoyed camping,
pool, and tinkering with automobiles. He also was a certified pilot
and scuba diver.
</P>
<P>
   DesVergnes, who operated a small construction company in
Attleboro, was an impulsive outdoorsman who could cajole his
fiancee, Cindy Ray, into a skiing or camping trip on a moment's
notice. He kept an airboat for skimming across the 100-acre
cranberry bog he owned near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a machinist who worked in Rhode Island, was drawn to
water sports when he was not working overtime to support his
5-year-old son, who lived with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was very concerned about his child,'' said Nelson's
sister, Dawn Poillucci of North Smithfield, R.I. ``He is not the
type who wouldn't return and not tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Orlando police, Renquin's condo looked like a
vacation pad left behind for a day trip. Investigators found a
refrigerator stocked with $200 worth of hamburger, hot dogs, beer,
and chips; $500 in a safe; clothing; and unmade beds.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card and cellular telephone records show no transactions
or calls after the men's disappearance. And nothing in their past
suggests they might have tried to disappear and reinvent themselves
outside Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, this is the first time we've had three adult
people disappear under these conditions,'' Bergin said.
</P>
<P>
   The GMC Jimmy that Renquin rented has not been found, despite
massive publicity. Aerial surveillance has turned up nothing. And
ground searches have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   None of the few people who saw the trio here have reported
anything unusual. A boyhood friend of Renquin's, who now lives in
an Orlando suburb, talked to them Sept. 28 _ the day they vanished
_ and made plans to meet Sept. 30 for a night of fun.
</P>
<P>
   One area of agreement is that the men were not typical Florida
tourists. With a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the ready, and their
love of the water as a bond, the trio were likely to have explored
the lakes, canals, and remote dirt roads that infiltrate the
nearby, uninhabited flatland.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's where they are _ undiscovered in a secluded ditch,
invisible from the air, and miles from civilization _ the trauma of
their disappearance may linger for years for three families that
desperately want closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the days go by, I just get more angry and more sad,'' said
Ray, DesVergnes' fiancee. ``I want someone to say something,
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the two months that the men have been missing, the families
said, two or three weeks may pass before the Orlando police contact
them with an update.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really wonder, with three missing guys who aren't from
there, do they really care?'' asked Paul Renquin, Scott's brother.
</P>
<P>
   But the police say they are doing everything they can in a case
with no leads. ``I can't call them every day and tell them nothing
happened,'' Bergin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the families have taken their story to the news
media, to TV tabloid shows, and to a psychic in the hope of
uncovering a kernel of new information.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Sad song of the rock 'n' roll star

   LUFKIN, Texas _ A buddy and I were riding around, going nowhere
in particular, something we've been doing since back in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Kiss'' by J. Frank Wilson was playing on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one thing wrong with that song,'' my friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No there isn't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was our tribute to J. Frank Wilson, someone we'd known
since grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember that ``Last Kiss'' hit No. 1 on the charts in
1964, making J. Frank a rock 'n' roll idol and, for a short while,
the most famous guy to have graduated from Lufkin High.
</P>
<P>
   You can read all about him on the album notes of the new CD,
``The 'Last Kiss' Sessions,'' previously unreleased recordings by
J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers, on the Collectables label
(www.cicadelic.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Kiss'' tells the story of a teenage girl who dies in the
arms of her boyfriend after a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   It's no more tragic than the real life story of J. Frank. It
just took him a lot longer to die.
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank had graduated from high school in 1960, a year behind
me. I remember him playing rock 'n' roll at school assembly. Along
the way he got the nickname ``Greasy Frank,'' because of the way he
slicked back his hair, rock star-style.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1964, he had the talent to go with the look.
</P>
<P>
   Singing with the Cavaliers, a group he had met up with while
stationed in San Angelo, Texas, during a stint in the Air Force, J.
Frank was touring the country with his hit song.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Lufkin, a bunch of us got together to watch him
perform on national TV. In a brief interview afterward, the emcee
asked him if he'd had a nickname back in high school. J. Frank
mumbled something without really answering the question.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of us around the TV yelled out in unison, ``Greasy
Frank!''
</P>
<P>
   But not one of us resented his good fortune. We were proud of
him for doing what we'd all thought we'd do, become rich and
famous. Not so rich, as it would turn out for him, and not so
famous for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Oct. 23 near Lima, Ohio, a station wagon
the band was traveling in crashed head-on with a tractor-trailer
when their driver fell asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The driver died instantly. J. Frank was severely injured with
head lacerations, broken ribs and a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Within in a week he was back on the stage, performing on
crutches and in a cast. Some say it was an example of his
professionalism. Others blamed the greed of the people making money
off of his success.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, in the process, J. Frank became addicted to pain
pills, and as a result of the head injuries, would later suffer
from seizures.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money: Along with the million-seller gold record, a
``Last Kiss'' album had sold over 100,000 copies, but the record
company had to be sued in order to collect any royalties.
</P>
<P>
   According to the album notes, ``after all the lawyers and
expenses were paid, J. Frank ended up with around $3,000 ...''
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank would release other singles in the coming years, but
with little success. Ten years after ``Last Kiss'' hit No. 1 on the
charts, he was back in Lufkin working as a nursing home orderly.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he ended up himself, as a nursing home patient,
never having fully recovered from the injuries he received in the
car crash. He died Oct. 4, 1991, a couple of months short of his
50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Saddest of all, after his death was noted in Billboard magazine,
it came to light that another performer had been billing himself
for years as J. Frank Wilson in rock 'n' roll revues. Such is the
greed that took away his success, his money and even his name.
</P>
<P>
   If J. Frank Wilson's story could ever have a happy ending, it's
yet to be written. The album notes of the new CD suggest that
possibility:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this CD will change rock historians' perception
about his talent to reveal the unique flair and great style J.
Frank had when the world was waiting to be conquered by him and The
Cavaliers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not one thing wrong with that.

WHERE'S THE CASE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When the maneuvering overshadows the case, we
reach for our collection of one-liners about lawyers and pols.
</P>
<P>
   But when the maneuvering is the case, an air sickness bag is
more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   As the endgame (we hope) of you-know-what nears, for example,
House Republicans scrambling for 218 impeachment votes are
privately beseeching independent counsel Ken Starr for help in
firming up GOP ``yes'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the official answer is ``no,'' but the fact is that
timing considerations are involved in pending decisions about the
possible charging of peripheral figures in the Monica Lewinsky
case. Any pre-Christmas indictments will have been sought with
Starr's knowledge that they can be fairly interpreted as a form of
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Judiciary Committee Republicans are talking
about putting out still another videotape, this one of President
Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones suit last January. Like the
release two months ago of Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony,
the purpose would be to sway opinion on the House floor, just as
the grand jury tape was supposed to sway voter opinion until it
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just for starters. As the endgame progresses, so to
speak, four schools of ``thought'' are converging almost like
vehicles fated to arrive at an intersection in the same, horrific
moment. The result will make an absurd shambles out of the remnants
of what was conceived in the 18th century as the last line of
constitutional defense against presidential abuse. Three come from
the president's opponents, but the Democrats are making a
contribution of their own. And all of the schools of thought share
a fanatical desire to avoid actual consideration of a case for
impeachment based on direct evidence for a reason that can be
summarized in three letters, s-e-x.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the Democrats first, the typical response in the House is
that the allegations contained in Starr's original referral and
Judiciary Committee counsel David Schippers's rewriting of them
don't come within a country mile of what the framers meant to be
impeachable offenses. It is the political equivalent of a dismissal
motion in criminal court or a request for summary judgment in a
civil matter. It is willing to assume, for argument's sake, the
veracity of Starr's allegations without testing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans similarly are looking for ways around the
evidence, such as:
</P>
<P>
   _In their latest formal statements in response to Hyde's 81
questions, the GOP members are typically saying that Clinton and
his lawyers have not provided exculpatory evidence that refutes
Starr's charges, as if that were the defendant's burden in this
country. In fact, he has.
</P>
<P>
   _The Republicans also are selling their House members the line
that a vote on impeachment is the rough equivalent of a grand jury
indictment and that therefore the mere fact of allegedly serious
charges should be enough to prompt a vote to ``send it to the
Senate'' for trial. This challenges the Watergate precedent, in
which House Judiciary Committee members approached the issue of
Richard Nixon's guilt as jurors needing to be convinced by the
evidence beyond any reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   _The GOP membership is also being told that the House is not the
proper forum for consideration of alternative approaches like
formal censure, these being more appropriate for the Senate in a
``punishment'' phase.
</P>
<P>
   All of this babble obscures the absence of a case against the
president as most people would understand the term _ meaning direct
evidence from witnesses and/or documents. Above all, both parties
are ignoring the crux of the entire matter _ whether Clinton
committed perjury in the Jones deposition and compounded it before
the grand jury because he answered ``no'' to the Jones lawyers'
question about is relationship with Lewinsky based on a tortured
definition of sex, and they are ignoring it because, as Starr
discovered to his regret, the only way to confront it is to focus
on the president's and Lewinsky's versions of what each did to the
other physically in private.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Judiciary Committee is likely to send to the floor
a piece of junk in which the only witness has been the prosecutor
himself, and the only evidence has been the uncross-examined
testimony and statements of witnesses _ most of which (Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, Betty Currie, the president, to name four)
conflict on key points and disagree with Starr's selective
characterizations of their information.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast to the solemnity and care taken during Watergate 24
years ago could not be more complete, or more damning.

YUKON SLED RACER TRUSTS HIS LIFE TO DOG'S INSTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAMPTON, N.H. _ So dogs are smarter than humans after all.
</P>
<P>
   At least certain dogs, of certain breeds, on certain Alaskan
peaks, during whiteout blizzard conditions in the middle of the
night with the wind chill at something way below zero.
</P>
<P>
   George Cook discovered this fact the hard way _ he lived through
it. But consider the alternative: winding up in a tangle of husky
and harness at the bottom of a 1,000-foot cliff, perhaps never to
be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wound up crossing the finish line of the Yukon
Quest, regarded by many as the world's toughest sled-dog race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it because it was an extreme sport or an extreme
challenge,'' said Cook. It was just, well, there. ``Nobody had ever
come up from the lower 48 with their own team of dogs and entered
the Yukon Quest and finished it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He did finish, albeit in last place.
</P>
<P>
   Mushers, as sled-dog racers are known, call the Yukon Quest ``A
Thousand Miles of Hell,'' and this is not a term of endearment.
While the Iditarod is the better-known sled-dog race, the Quest,
says Cook, is tougher and more dangerous. The trail runs along
ice-jammed rivers and across a trio of mountain ranges, with vast
distances between checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Cook ran the Quest in 1992. His wife and handler, Ann, has
written a book about the journey titled ``Running North,'' a
chronological account of how the Cook family hitched its sled team
to a star, moved temporarily to Alaska and mushed their way to
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   But back to that really smart dog.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and his team of 12 Siberian huskies were riding a
knife-edge on the American Summit. It was the middle of the night.
Cliffs dropped off on both sides. Cook was nearly blinded by the
driving snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at that point when you realize that you have just
consigned your life to your dogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest trail followed a road at the summit. Cook, thinking he
had his bearings, was following tufts of grass that he assumed were
on the left shoulder of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Then his lead dog, Minnie, suddenly turned and lept over the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Cook hollered at the dog, sure that she was about to pull him
and his team down the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she had pulled them _ against his commands _ up onto
the level road. He had been off the shoulder of the road, riding
alongside it. Had the dog listened to him...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who was driving off the 1,000-foot cliff,'' said
Cook. ``Minnie tolerated it just long enough and said `Buzz off, I
ain't dying,''' added Ann Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she continued, ``you wonder who the superior
species is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cooks have long competed on the eastern circuit of sled-dog
racing, from Ontario to Pennsylvania, and in 1991 they decided they
were ready for Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly find it fun being a big fish in a small
pond,'' explained George Cook.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a leave from his job as a geologist and the family
packed 32 sled dogs, one 2-year-old human and all the equipment
they needed into a truck and went north to Alaska. (It is not, of
course, as simple as that _ running the Iditarod, by one estimate,
costs between $20,000 and $30,000, and the Quest requires more
supplies).
</P>
<P>
   While George trained for mushing glory, Ann and a fellow handler
went about the work _ the child care, the sewing of dog boot-ies,
the food preparation _ that makes the glory possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Cook is often asked _ by men, she points out _ how she felt
about doing the ``women's work'' while her husband ran the race.
The question annoys her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to emphasize that teamwork is a big part of''
sled-dog racing, she said. And team members tend to play to their
strengths. Ann Cook races sometimes, too, with her husband acting
as her handler. But she says she is the better handler.
</P>
<P>
   When she finished one race, Ann Cook recalls, her husband met
her at the finish line. He had remembered to bring beer. What she
really needed was a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to deify the person'' who actually runs the race, Ann
Cook said. But behind every respectable deity is an entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Running North,'' actually focuses on the travails of
the entourage: faulty trucks, sick dogs, cramped accommodations.
One of the toughest things about being an ``Arctic Mommy,'' said
Ann Cook, is that kids hate snowsuits.
</P>
<P>
   While attempting to hitch the team for one race, she put her
fully-bundled toddler in the cab of the truck. It was 22 degrees
below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the child was screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had taken every bit of her clothing off and was wondering
why she was so cold,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooks met at Phillips Exeter Academy. She muses that, if
melded into one person, the pair would have the perfect set of
skills for winning sled-dog races.
</P>
<P>
   George Cook finished about five days behind the Quest winner _
at 16 days, 8 hours, and 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When you ask him about finishing last in the Quest, George Cook
grimaces slightly. ``It's not that I finished last,'' he said,
pointedly. ``It's that I was the last finisher. There were 11 other
people who crashed and burned (and did not finish). I feel I beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do it again,'' he added, sitting in his elegantly
appointed living room as a kennel full of huskies howled outside.
Then he pauses. ``Would I want to? I don't know.''

SELLING LANGUAGE SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Language can be a tough customer, but it has its vulnerable
side, too, and many a word has had its character changed by the
company it keeps. Sheldon Brown of Newton, Mass. sees it happening
in headlines these days, when white supremacist is abbreviated to
supremacist. There are, potentially, all sorts of supremacists, so
this shortcut seems lazy and inaccurate to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Gordon of Wayland, Mass. has a similar problem with quality,
as in ``quality care for all.'' ``Am I a dying breed in thinking
that quality is not an adjective?'' she asks. ``Aren't we really
striving for high-quality care?''
</P>
<P>
   This shortened supremacist is a newish usage; quality is much
older, as is the debate over its adjectival use. But there's no
generalizing about the outcome of such innovations; sometimes the
new usage storms the castle, sometimes it drowns in the moat.
</P>
<P>
   Take chauvinism, for example, which traces its lineage to
Napoleonic superpatriot Nicolas Chauvin. A synonym for showy,
extreme patriotism, it was sometimes borrowed for other senses _
scientific chauvinism, cultural chauvinism _ but it kept its
essential meaning for more than a century. Then male chauvinism
(the term, not the fact) came along. And because plain old
chauvinism was relatively underused, while male chauvinism was a
key concept for the growing feminist movement, chauvinism's other
meanings faded into the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Their exile didn't last, though. Other chauvinisms _ New York,
Hindu, neighborhood _ are back, at least as frequent in these pages
as the male variety. The same may well happen to supremacist _ when
we have less reason to assume supremacists are white, and fewer
occasions for headlines about them.
</P>
<P>
   Quality, however, is not likely to be ousted from its adjectival
role. Though many of us were taught to avoid it, and some
authorities still dislike it, quality for high-quality has been
spreading since the 16th century, and dictionaries now accept it.
</P>
<P>
   But other such truncations are resisting the pressure. Explicit
still means something more than ``sexually explicit,'' despite the
influence of movie-ratings language. Graphic has the same problem,
but thanks to its usefulness in other realms, it's unlikely to be
reduced to mere code for ``filled with graphic sex/violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of another strange coinage, though, is hard to predict.
You hear it on the radio on a bad traffic day: When there's too
much to say, a curiosity slowdown _ a useful recent coinage meaning
a traffic jam caused by rubberneckers _ sometimes gets shortened to
curiosity. ``There's a pile-up on 93 North,'' the traffic guy will
say, ``creating a major curiosity southbound.'' Yes, it could
become another local language quirk, but I'm hoping it's just a
passing curiosity.

PATRIOTS' VICTORY A PRODUCT OF PLUCK AS MUCH AS LUCK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Understand that we will never get the
complete, unfiltered truth.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll is not going to walk into his day-after press
conference and say, ``Ernie, Sid, Dante, and the rest of us were
sitting around this morning saying, `Man, can you believe how lucky
we were Monday? I mean, take away those two sick calls, and our
season is over.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's not going to do that. Steve Mariucci is not going to do
that. Chan Gailey is not going to do that. The Tuna is not going to
do that. There might have been a time when Mike Ditka actually
would have done that, but now he is curiously neutered, so the fact
is that (itals)nobody(unitals) is going to do that, however obvious
it is to you and me that Buffalo had a legitimate victory taken
away from it at Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But we must thank Carroll for not insulting our intelligence. He
did acknowledge his team's good fortune when asked how he would
have liked to be Buffalo coach Wade Phillips in the aftermath of
the Great Foxboro Heist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be bitter,'' Carroll acknowledged. ``I'd hate to think
you'd lose on a call in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't just the bogus pass interference call on
Henry Jones _ psst, Terry, you've got to catch that ball, son _ on
what turned out to be the game's penultimate play. It was the play
before, too, and not just because Shawn Jefferson was not inbounds,
or because he was shy of the first down on top of that. No, no, no.
It was because there was a zebra standing there and (itals)he
didn't want to make the call.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened to me,'' said Carroll, ``I'd probably be
talking the way Wade is talking. I don't know what else to tell
you, other than that I'd be reacting in bitter fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The only word to describe officiating conduct such as we
witnessed on Sunday is ``unacceptable.'' The Conduct Police
probably will wind up fining Doug Flutie, but they should fine the
official who gagged on the call three times whatever they take from
Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says it really was pass interference in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry was shoved,'' Carroll insisted. ``He wound up moving a
long way, or else he would have caught the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Terry Glenn is a big-time, big-city wide receiver. The
ball was eminently catchable. At the same time, Carroll agreed with
what everyone has been saying about pass interference on a Hail
Mary pass; namely, that he never has seen that call made in that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Gift that the final play was, the Patriots did indeed take
advantage of that largess. Everyone from Presque Isle to Pawcatuck
knew that Drew Bledsoe was going to be looking for Ben Coates, but
the Bills acted as if ol' number 87 was some kid off the special
teams. Earth to Buffalo: Next time the Patriots are at the 1-yard
line, forget about play-action fakes. Put four guys on Coates and
let Bledsoe figure out something else to do. In other words, let's
see if he can think as fast as Flutie does.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Carroll seems to be in the proper spirit. He knows very
well that his team remains a viable playoff contender because of
the whims of incompetent referees. He is undoubtedly realistic
enough to know that the next time he won't be so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to another encouraging Carroll admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (itals)have(unitals) to improve,'' he said. ``There are
areas where we need to improve. The feeling in my mind is that we
need to be very balanced in dealing with what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! We have a coach who actually does
understand how fragile his team's recent ``success'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Let's skip the adjectives and verbs and rely solely on the
numbers for just a minute. Let's examine the following statistics
over the last six games, during which the Maybe They're Going To
Connecticut And Maybe They Aren't Patriots are 3-3: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rushing  &UR;  &LR; $ Rushing $ Passing  &UR;  &LR; $ Passing
</P>
<P>
   attempts $ yardage $ attempts $ &UR;  &LR; yardage
</P>
<P>
   111  &UR;  &LR; $ 250  &UR;  &LR; $ 257  &UR;  &LR; $ &UR;  &LR; 1,520
</P>
<P>
   ($ used as column separator) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's more than a 6-1 ratio in favor of passing yardage. Can
this continue if the Patriots are to be successful in their
remaining four games, not to mention any playoff games they might
stumble into?
</P>
<P>
   Well, coach? Can they? Huh, huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to try to get it (i.e. the running
game) in better shape,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   This is something shy of full disclosure. We can be sure of
that. There is no way that professionals such as Carroll and Ernie
Zampese aren't scared bleepless over the deterioration of the
running game during the past two months. Neither man will ever come
right out and say, ``Geez, our offensive line can't run-block worth
a damn,'' or, ``Robert Edwards is an inconsistent runner,'' both of
which are irrefutably true facts, as we say.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have one (on-paper) easy game remaining, and even
that one, against the St. Louis Rams, has an element of peril
attached since it's on the road. Can they beat Pittsburgh, San
Francisco, and the Jets if the offense consists of Drew, Drew, and
Drew, mixed with an occasional Derrick Cullors kickoff return to
the 45?
</P>
<P>
   Are you nuts?
</P>
<P>
   The coach knows. There is no doubt whatsoever that the coach
fully realizes how little chance his team will have of winning any
more than one of the three tough games left on the schedule if
passing is forced to constitute more than 80 percent of the
offense, as it has the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a broken record on that one; I know,'' he said. ``We need
to run the football, and we are not going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The final item is a defensive matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yardage is piling up on us in the passing game,'' Carroll
pointed out. ``We are giving up too many big plays, and normally we
are pretty good at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Examined in the sober light of day, the comeback victory over
Buffalo was a kiss from the Pigskin God, nothing more. Justice did
not prevail. The coach knows it, too, and that's very good.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep all this in mind. These things always even out in the
long run.
</P>

A QUIET PRAGMATIST FOR THE `AVERAGE GUY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ James St. George's eyes brighten behind big round
glasses. He would like nothing better than to give you his favorite
statistical gem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Massachusetts since 1995 have paid less of their
income (10.88 percent) in state taxes than have residents of
Mississippi (10.92 percent), says St. George, executive director of
the Tax Equity Alliance of Massachusetts and lobbyist for the
average guy. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The comparison with Mississippi says a lot about the fiscal
transformation of a state tagged only a decade ago with the
nickname, ``Taxachusetts.'' St. George, 43, hopes the comparison
won't sit well with Bay Staters.
</P>
<P>
   As TEAM's leader &UR;  &LR; during a time the lobbying organization has
suffered numerous legislative defeats, St. George culls reports for
facts and figures to hammer home a central point: Wealthy people
and businesses received the vast majority of recent tax cuts in
Massachusetts, which accounts for why Massachusetts residents have
paid less of their income in taxes than people in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   His skills as policy wonk _ polished at the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities in Washington _ contrast to the rhetoric-slinging
of his predecessor, James Braude. But St. George's admirers argue
his quiet pragmatism may be the only way to lobby for tax policies
that favor the average person in a state Legislature dominated by
special interests and in a mood to use a budget surplus for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Jim St. George not been there the results of this year's
tax cuts would, I believe, have been even worse'' says Arline
Isaacson, a lobbyist for the Massachusetts Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is not much appetite these days on Beacon Hill for
progressive tax policy. Even before St. George's arrival two years
ago, TEAM had lost the influence the organization enjoyed during
its 1990 heyday, when Braude led the charge to defeat a ballot
question that sought a $2 billion tax rollback.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, state lawmakers passed the biggest tax
reduction in Massachusetts history, voting overwhelmingly to slash
in half the tax rate on income from stock and bond investments. The
tax package was heaped on top of big breaks granted in prior years
to financial firms and investors. In 1994, for example, capital
gains on investments held more than six years were made tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   St. George, however, has had some victories.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he &UR;  &LR;  successfully lobbied for the only &UR;  &LR; tax change
targeted to middle-class  &UR;  &LR; earners: Doubling the personal exemption
for individual taxpayers. In 1997, he helped state senators and
advocates push through a tax credit for low-income workers, making
Massachusetts one of seven states with such a provision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his successes, St. George has big shoes to fill. Braude
had keen political instincts, and he led TEAM during an era that
was more friendly to the group's &UR;  &LR;  mission. Under Braude's
leadership, unions and human services organizations staged public
rallies over tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``contentious atmosphere'' on Beacon Hill ``has been
replaced with one where there is virtually no debate on fiscal
matters,'' says Braude, who is now a political consultant. ``That
is not a very fertile environment for progressive tax reform.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Michael Widmer, president of the conservative Massachusetts
Taxpayers Foundation, says that Braude was able to argue his
position ``quickly and facilely'' during frequent debates between
the two in the Legislature. As antitax sentiment built on Beacon
Hill, Braude's brashness began rubbing people the wrong way. His
wins turned to defeats.
</P>
<P>
   While St. George is low-key, he does not possess Braude's level
of political savvy. For example, in legislative hearings in &UR;  &LR;  May
on the bill to cut taxes on dividends and interest, a Westport
woman gave gripping testimony about how the existing 12 percent tax
rate had reduced the proceeds from a life insurance policy left by
her late husband, money she used to raise her two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   When St. George testified against cutting the 12 percent rate,
he launched into his arguments and ``acted as if she didn't make
those statements,'' said one person at the hearing. ``Braude might
have played that a little differently. He would've seen the
politics of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But to St. George's credit, Beacon Hill observers say, the
deliberate crafting of his own style may be more suited to the
times.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in his office on a narrow street across the
Boston Common from the gold-domed State House, St. George describes
that style as seeking to ``appeal to people's wisdom _ that does
make me sound naive doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Over the past several years, there have been enough
defeats to say, `Let's try it another way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself a ``lunch-pail Democrat,'' St. George criticizes
members of the left who have taken on too many issues. Take gay
rights. Though important, says St. George, who is gay, ``it's not
as fundamental as the economic rights, the economic condition, of
people being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   His family was among those left behind. His parents and their
six children first lived in a house on a dirt road outside Duluth,
Minn. They then moved to a house with a coal furnace in the
basement. St. George's father, a laborer for US Steel, was often
laid off, once for five months through a Minnesota winter.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, St. George joined the US Navy and went to the
University of Minnesota with funding from the GI bill. He won a
federal Harry S. Truman Scholarship, which awards tuition to one
college sophomore from each state.
</P>
<P>
   St. George, whose father is Chippewa Indian, worked on economic
development for the Native American community in Minneapolis as a
31-year-old intern for the American-Indian Business Development
Corp. He then went off to graduate school at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, where he met his partner, Mark
Sullivan, who is the director of Joseph Kennedy II's staff in the
Boston area. They moved to Washington, where St. George was an
analyst for the American Federation of State County and Muncipal
employees.
</P>
<P>
   He was then recruited to direct a project at the Center on
Budget Priorities which works &UR;  &LR; with states on shaping fiscal
policy. St. George left the center because he and Sullivan wanted
to move to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   St. George is also trying to broaden the organization's mission.
Whereas TEAM has been most focused on tax issues, St. George says
he would like to devote more time to analyzing the entire state
budget and monitoring how government spending priorities shift and
who benefits or loses from those shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he plucks another statistic out of the air to demonstrate
a point: Tax policy and budget policy are inextricably linked. ``I
like to remind people,'' he says, ``that we have the worst school
buildings and the third-highest per-capita income in the nation.''

LANGUAGE CLASS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORELIA, Mexico _ We stumbled half asleep into a large
processing room at the airport in Morelia. It was 1:15 a.m., and my
15-year-old daughter, Carrie, and I had just arrived for two weeks
of studying Spanish and learning about Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Before us stood a large sign with a pointed warning. To ``avoid
going to prison,'' we should fess up now to any guns, explosives,
or cartridges we might be carrying. The crowd in front of us, by
appearance overwhelmingly Mexican or Mexican-American, fed their
luggage into the X-ray machine and moved forward at the blink of a
green light. Our bags were then pulled inside by a conveyor belt
only to have the light flash red. It seemed, if only for an
instant, that we might be on our way to Morelia's equivalent of the
Tijuana jail.
</P>
<P>
   We never found out what triggered the alarm. We were directed to
a table where a customs official, after asking if we were tourists,
waved us through without so much as a glance inside our bags. And
so began our little adventure south of the border. In two weeks we
learned a fair amount of Spanish and met nice people from both
sides of the Rio Grande. We also had our eyes opened to a world
that we, like many Americans, knew remarkably little about, given
that Mexico is our next-door neighbor as well as a major trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Morelia, three hours west of Mexico City, is a bustling city of
800,000. That makes it bigger than Boston, but it is a place I had
never heard of until I started looking into Spanish language
schools last winter. Glance at a map of the hot Mexican tourist
destinations and Morelia is nowhere to be seen. It lacks the glitz
of Acapulco or Puerto Vallarta or the excitement of Mexico City.
Most of the Americans you run into are there to study Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But Morelia is a tourist destination for Mexicans and, along
with the surrounding area, has its share of attractions. Its
6,300-foot elevation gives it a pleasant climate, without the layer
of smog choking Mexico City. Unlike many supposedly more
sophisticated towns, Morelia never knocked down older structures to
make way for glassy skyscrapers. Centuries-old colonial
architecture is everywhere. It seems unbelievable for a city of
nearly 1 million, but the only buildings in Morelia that rise more
than two or three stories are the cathedrals.
</P>
<P>
   One of its most striking features is a beautiful stone aqueduct,
built in 1785, that boasts 253 arches and runs for blocks on the
east side of the city. Off to one side, a block or two from CMI, is
the much-photographed Tarascas Fountain with its statue of three
native women holding a large tray of fruit to the sky. During our
visit, boisterous young people threw a number of unwary onlookers
into the fountain to celebrate Mexico's advance in the World Cup
after it tied Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie and I got a glimpse almost immediately of the economic
woes that continue to afflict Mexico four years after the financial
crisis that came with devaluation. The man who came to pick us up
at the airport, with his wife and son, was an unemployed
veterinarian. Unable to find work in the field he was trained in,
Pedro Rangel shoots photographs and video of weddings and
graduations. He and his wife, Carmen, are also enthusiastic hosts
to foreign visitors who, like us, hope to supplement classroom
instruction in Spanish with the experience of living with a Mexican
family.
</P>
<P>
   The small weekly stipend a student pays through the school for a
``homestay,'' providing a bed and three meals a day, is negligible
by American standards but a welcome boost in family income for many
host families. To the disappointment of the Rangels, there were not
enough students signed up that week in June for Centro Mexicano
Internacional's immersion Spanish program to require their
hospitality. Their contribution was reduced to odd jobs, like
driving Carrie and me between Morelia and the airport and taking
pictures at the fiesta thrown by the school for visiting students.
</P>
<P>
   My hosts were a semiretired orthopedic surgeon of 70 and his
wife. I was advised in advance by the school that ``la senora'' was
a terrific cook, and it turned out to be no exaggeration. The
doctor, born to poverty and fatherless from infancy, was a twinkly
eyed raconteur who tried to speak slowly for my benefit but whom I
still frequently found difficult to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie stayed with my hosts' daughter and her family a few miles
away on the outskirts of the city. The daughter was a social
worker, her husband a cheery and prosperous sheet rock contractor.
Our first day in Morelia he drove me to his country club, where I
drank a beer under an umbrella on the patio while he worked out in
the gym. There were two girls in the family, 17 and 15, and
12-year-old Pepito, who spent much of his free time playing video
games with Carrie and trading the Spanish and English equivalents
for such key phrases as ``push the button.''
</P>
<P>
   On Day 1 of our language program, the doctor gave me directions
from his centrally located house to the school, a mile away. ``You
can't miss it,'' I think he said in Spanish. But of course I took a
wrong turn and did. Walking into the 8:30 a.m. placement test 15
minutes late only to confront the ever-baffling question of when to
use the subjunctive, and when not, was a little unnerving. But
after all, what were they going to do _ flunk me? It turned out my
efforts with language tapes and weekly sessions with a Cuban-born
tutor had not been totally wasted. I ended up placed in an
interesting group of five Americans who were reasonably adept in
conversational Spanish. They included a 27-year-old from Iowa who
had just completed his first year teaching high school Spanish and
a college student from Texas who was aiming to become a missionary.
There was also a political science professor from Rock Springs,
Wyo., and a high school English teacher who grew up in Andover,
Mass., and now lives on an island off Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   CMI occupies a handsome old building, near the center of town,
whose most attractive feature is a large courtyard in the middle.
Our school day began with two hours of grammar taught by Lucia, a
friendly Mexican woman in her early 30s. After break, a young
mother of two named Yvonne took over with two hours of
conversation. We usually had a modest amount of homework, but the
learning continued throughout the day, in school and out.
</P>
<P>
   These programs are a great way to study a language, see another
country, and get know to know the people by living with a family.
With the rapid growth of Spanish as the second language of the
United States, programs like CMI's have been coming on strong. But
you'd never guess it from the experience in Mexico this summer.
After recording its record summer enrollment last year, CMI
suffered almost a 50 percent drop in students signed up this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for staying away was readily apparent _ two ongoing
news stories that did not exactly lay out the welcome mat for
people thinking of heading south of the border. Violent crime was
reported to be surging in Mexico City, and in late spring there
were reports of smoke blanketing large parts of Mexico as a result
of out-of-control burning in the countryside. One instructor in the
school's summer master's program for Spanish teachers was so
unnerved that he reneged on his teaching commitment two days before
he was due to arrive, according to Rebeca Alfaro, CMI's director of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the problems in other parts of Mexico that
made the headlines did not really apply to Morelia. The frightening
crimes reported against tourists in Mexico City, and the horrifying
rape-murder in March of a Vermont woman near the Pacific resort
town of Puerto Escondido, did not say much about the more low-key
Morelia. Not that crime is a stranger here, but it tends to be more
the nuisance variety, like burglaries and pickpocketing, Alfaro
said. She said there had not been a crime reported by a Spanish
student in a year and a half, since a man said police picked him up
and demanded money after falsely accusing him of being involved in
drugs. As for the smoke, ``We didn't have any in Morelia,'' Alfaro
said. Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   CMI is not the only Spanish language program for foreigners in
Morelia. Others are Centro Cultural de Lenguas and Instituto Baden
Powell. Many such programs, in other Mexican cities and in other
Spanish-speaking countries as well, have their own Web sites.
Alternatively, one can sort through the possibilities with the help
of a feeder service based in the United States. I used Louise
Harber's Foreign Language Study Abroad Service, in South Miami.
Another is Charlene Biddulph's Language Studies Abroad, in Solana
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As I probably should have anticipated, two weeks turned out to
be too brief to achieve a breakthrough in my Spanish. The reality
dawned on Day 8, when I called a local restaurant to make a
reservation for the following night. I wanted to take our two
home-stay families to dinner as a way of thanking them. ``Su
nombre, por favor,'' the woman on the other end of the line asked
again, with some impatience. I had already told her how many we
would be, so my frustration was rising as well. Then it dawned on
me she was asking, quite reasonably, for my name, not the number in

DOCTORS IMPRESSED BY BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Credit the custom-made three-quarter cast that
stabilized his finger but left the tips free to grip the football.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the ``very tiny bit'' of painkiller doctors administered
to the fracture to numb it while preserving the sensation needed to
control the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, his doctors and others say, credit quarterback
Drew Bledsoe for having the stamina and skill to steer his team to
come-from-behind triumphs in back-to-back games despite two
fractures in the index finger of his tossing hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew himself, the person, probably is the most important
part,'' said Bert Zarins, the Patriots' team physician. ``It's his
attitude, and pain tolerance, and ability to concentrate and
function in spite of distractions. That's what has gotten him where
he is and is keeping him up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just helped him a bit, but 99 percent of the credit goes to
Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sports medicine specialists were in awe of Bledsoe's
performance, much as fans were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sucking it up on a very high scale,'' said Dr. Robert
Leach, editor of the American Journal of Sports Medicine and former
chief physician for the US Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a defensive lineman doing it, I would say he
sucked it up and that's pretty good, but a lot if not most of them
would do it,'' Leach added. ``As a receiver or passer, and with the
injury being on the hand he has to use, I think it really is very,
very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to play with pain. It's another to play with
pain, and play the whole way through, and be effective. That is
quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe did what he did eight days ago in Miami on his own,
shaking off his newly fractured finger to lead his team on a
last-minute, game-winning drive. Sunday evening against Buffalo,
however, he had a lot of help from the medical crew at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Herndon, a renowned hand specialist, took a movable
X-ray called a fluoroscopy of Bledsoe's finger to determine just
where the breaks were and how stable they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at the outer two joints,'' Zarins said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Using that information, the hospital's Department of Orthotics
took a plastic mold of the quarterback's finger, then fitted him
with a special plastic cast on the back two-thirds of the digit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves the front of the finger exposed for sensation. It's
solid, in the same position he holds the football,'' Zarins
explained. ``It stabilizes the finger in that position but leaves
the fingertips free for sensation and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will likely be wearing the splint again next week, and
for at least two more after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes three to four weeks to heal,'' said Zarins.
``We possibly will protect it for a week or two longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a risk of Bledsoe reinjuring the finger by playing
Sunday? A slight one, according to Zarins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not prohibitive,'' he said. ``He didn't do anything that
I think could give him permanent harm. Football is a risky game,
nothing is without risk in football, but this was not an
unreasonable risk because he had his finger protected. We tried it
out once in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Louis Meeks, senior orthopedic surgeon at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, agreed that the danger of reinjury was
limited: ``They didn't burn any bridges by letting him play. If it
got crooked they could make a little incision and use a little pin
or small screws to hold the bone together and it still would
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his colleagues across the city, Arnold Scheller Jr., the
Celtics' team doctor, was profoundly impressed with what Bledsoe
did Sunday, calling it ``a gutsy job.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it rank with the kind of toughing-it-out performances
turned in regularly by Celtics legend Larry Bird, as some have
suggested? Not yet, said Scheller, who helped nurse Bird through
perpetual back pain, not to mention his inspired return after he
smashed his face on the Garden floor during the 1991 playoffs
against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparisons with Larry are a little early in Bledsoe's
career,'' said Scheller. ``He just hasn't had the history.''

CONFIDENCE FLAGGING IN NFL OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Expansion has affected professional football
in many areas, none more than officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many years ago, believe it or not, people seldom noticed
the officials. Certainly errors were made from time to time, but as
the first advent of instant replay demonstrated, it was far less
frequently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NFL has expanded, it needed to find more qualified
men to officiate more games, and, like quarterbacks, it seems there
are fewer of such men than the game is now demanding. A case in
point is that in a span of six days in Foxboro Stadium, the
Patriots tried to play football with two sets of officials who
seemed to have different ideas of what constitutes pass
interference in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, pass interference was nothing short of mayhem
for a crew headed by referee Ed Hochuli. Assault was allowed, and
so was battery, as long as they didn't happen simultaneously.
Patriots tight end Ben Coates, Miami middle linebacker Zach Thomas,
and New England rookie cornerback Tebucky Jones made that clear
when they all got away with mugging the opposition on various plays
without being penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, a crew led by Walt Coleman apparently defined
pass interference as letting the thought cross your mind that you
might possibly touch someone before the ball arrives if you think
no one's looking. How any team is supposed to play consistently
under such a circumstance is difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're seeming to see more calls on pass
interference,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll carefully conceded one
day after a big interference call on the Buffalo Bills at the end
of Sunday's game kept New England's playoff hopes alive. ``We were
told before the season the biggest issue is if the defensive back
is playing the ball, then contact is basically allowed but it does
seem there's been an increase in those calls recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Since no one announced a rule change, it's difficult to fathom
why that would be, but what is more difficult to fathom is why in
the Miami game Coates was allowed to run over a defensive back
while getting into position to catch a touchdown pass and later
Thomas was allowed to hold Coates's jersey and nearly drag him down
with the ball in the air and Jones was allowed to knock a receiver
over with the ball in the air and his back to it when just six days
later Henry Jones is called for barely pushing Terry Glenn on a
play when Glenn was so ``interfered'' with that the ball still hit
him in the chest before he dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever seeing a flag called on a Hail Mary like
that, to tell you the truth,'' Carroll said. ``At first I thought
it was on us. But after watching it, Terry was interfered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he was, but Shawn Jefferson was clotheslining Buffalo
defensive back Thomas Smith around the neck on the same play, and
who knows how much other pushing and shoving was going on? That is
why, in 24 years of covering the NFL, I can't think of three times
when I've seen a call made on such a last-gasp pass. So why wasn't
it a no-call Sunday, as is the longstanding tradition on such
plays? You'll never get an answer from the NFL on that.
</P>
<P>
   But, then again, why were eight penalties called during the
drive on which Buffalo took the lead, half of then assisting the
Bills dearly? Why was a Doug Flutie scramble that so obviously
ended a half-yard short of a first down ruled a first down? And why
was Jefferson's fourth-down reception on the sideline ruled
inbounds when at the very best he had only one foot inbounds and
very well may have had neither in, when the official charged with
making the call ruled him out of bounds before being talked out of
it?
</P>
<P>
   Most damning of all, though, were the claims of at least four
Bills that one official said, ``Just give it to them,'' before
Jefferson's catch was ruled good.
</P>
<P>
   If these were just isolated incidents, in one or two games, it
would be bad enough. But they are not. Such indecision and
inconsistency has become a constant drumbeat of small errors since
Jerry Seeman took over the oversight of NFL officials, and it has
begun to undermine the credibility of the game.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, could be worse than a referee blowing a coin
flip?
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving, referee Phil Luckett went to flip a coin before
overtime in the Lions-Steelers game, as most people know by now.
Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis was clearly heard on a CBS tape calling
``tails,'' yet Luckett insisted he heard him say ``heads-tails''
and gave the Lions the right to receive the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Bettis, an Eagle scout by all accounts, said after the game _
which Detroit won on a field goal on the first possession _ ``I
didn't say, `heads-tails.' That's a lie. That's a bald-faced lie.''
</P>
<P>
   On the videotape, Bettis says, ``Tails.'' Period. Luckett,
however, does say, ``Call it in the air, heads-tails.'' A version
of the tape with enhanced audio done by a Pennsylvania TV station
indicates that someone says, ``heads,'' as well, but it's not
Bettis. Luckett would have had no idea who it was, though, because
he neglected to do the simplest thing. He did not look at Bettis,
which would seem to be of more import than watching the coin spin
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think they could at least get that right,'' said
a disgusted AFC coach.
</P>
<P>
   The absurdity of it all became clear Sunday when Atlanta
linebacker Jesse Tuggle walked out for the opening coin toss
against St. Louis with a small sign that said, ``heads.'' It was an
amusing moment in what has become the ``No Fun League,'' but it
also was a sign of the mockery NFL officials have begun to bring
upon themselves by seldom admitting their errors.
</P>
<P>
   As Detroit defensive back Robert Bailey said after the Steelers
game, ``It seemed like every time you looked up at the replay on
the scoreboard, you were disappointed again.'' And that's from a
guy whose team won.
</P>
<P>
   So what can the NFL do? First, it can do what every other
professional sports league does. It can demand that officials work
full-time, all year, because, as Carroll pointed out Monday, ``Who
wants to go to a part-time doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean they'd do a better job? You'd have to think so,
if they're spending each week watching tape of the two teams
they're about to work and studying possible odd circumstances or
mistakes of the past. Perhaps they even could visit the training
sites of the teams one day apiece to briefly explain how they call
certain actions, something they already do during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Second, bring back instant replay. At least for the coin flip.
</P>
<P>
   Third, hire people with no connection to the officials to run
the replay operation, instead of ex-members of the fraternity who
have been reluctant to overrule their brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, make the damn calls and get on with it. There are more
powwows in NFL stadiums than there used to be on the land of the
Plains Indians. It's fine that officials want to get things right,
but constant meetings and flags flying from 40 yards away are doing
as much to undermine our faith in the game as the blown calls
themselves are.
</P>
<P>
   Last, stop insulting everyone's intelligence about how often
mistakes are made. No human being is right all the time, not even
Jerry Seeman. Officiating a high-speed game played by huge men is
impossible to do perfectly, so when mistakes are made, say so.
Don't say you heard ``heads-tails'' when (A) the guy didn't say it,
and has got audio to prove it, and (B) you wouldn't know anyway,
because you didn't even look at him.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that NFL officials are trying to do their best
each Sunday, but no one can argue anymore that their best is good
enough. It is time commissioner Paul Tagliabue and most of all
George Young, who deeply loves the pro game and is now in charge of
its quality in many ways from New York, step in and admit that
changes have to be made _ before the fans start to think there is
more going on here than simple human error.

WHERE'S THE CASE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When the maneuvering overshadows the case, we
reach for our collection of one-liners about lawyers and pols.
</P>
<P>
   But when the maneuvering is the case, an air sickness bag is
more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   As the endgame (we hope) of you-know-what nears, for example,
House Republicans scrambling for 218 impeachment votes are
privately beseeching independent counsel Ken Starr for help in
firming up GOP ``yes'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the official answer is ``no,'' but the fact is that
timing considerations are involved in pending decisions about the
possible charging of peripheral figures in the Monica Lewinsky
case. Any pre-Christmas indictments will have been sought with
Starr's knowledge that they can be fairly interpreted as a form of
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Judiciary Committee Republicans are talking
about putting out still another videotape, this one of President
Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones suit last January. Like the
release two months ago of Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony,
the purpose would be to sway opinion on the House floor, just as
the grand jury tape was supposed to sway voter opinion until it
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just for starters. As the endgame progresses, so to
speak, four schools of ``thought'' are converging almost like
vehicles fated to arrive at an intersection in the same, horrific
moment. The result will make an absurd shambles out of the remnants
of what was conceived in the 18th century as the last line of
constitutional defense against presidential abuse. Three come from
the president's opponents, but the Democrats are making a
contribution of their own. And all of the schools of thought share
a fanatical desire to avoid actual consideration of a case for
impeachment based on direct evidence for a reason that can be
summarized in three letters, s-e-x.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the Democrats first, the typical response in the House is
that the allegations contained in Starr's original referral and
Judiciary Committee counsel David Schippers's rewriting of them
don't come within a country mile of what the framers meant to be
impeachable offenses. It is the political equivalent of a dismissal
motion in criminal court or a request for summary judgment in a
civil matter. It is willing to assume, for argument's sake, the
veracity of Starr's allegations without testing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans similarly are looking for ways around the
evidence, such as:
</P>
<P>
   _In their latest formal statements in response to Hyde's 81
questions, the GOP members are typically saying that Clinton and
his lawyers have not provided exculpatory evidence that refutes
Starr's charges, as if that were the defendant's burden in this
country. In fact, he has.
</P>
<P>
   _The Republicans also are selling their House members the line
that a vote on impeachment is the rough equivalent of a grand jury
indictment and that therefore the mere fact of allegedly serious
charges should be enough to prompt a vote to ``send it to the
Senate'' for trial. This challenges the Watergate precedent, in
which House Judiciary Committee members approached the issue of
Richard Nixon's guilt as jurors needing to be convinced by the
evidence beyond any reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   _The GOP membership is also being told that the House is not the
proper forum for consideration of alternative approaches like
formal censure, these being more appropriate for the Senate in a
``punishment'' phase.
</P>
<P>
   All of this babble obscures the absence of a case against the
president as most people would understand the term _ meaning direct
evidence from witnesses and/or documents. Above all, both parties
are ignoring the crux of the entire matter _ whether Clinton
committed perjury in the Jones deposition and compounded it before
the grand jury because he answered ``no'' to the Jones lawyers'
question about is relationship with Lewinsky based on a tortured
definition of sex, and they are ignoring it because, as Starr
discovered to his regret, the only way to confront it is to focus
on the president's and Lewinsky's versions of what each did to the
other physically in private.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Judiciary Committee is likely to send to the floor
a piece of junk in which the only witness has been the prosecutor
himself, and the only evidence has been the uncross-examined
testimony and statements of witnesses _ most of which (Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, Betty Currie, the president, to name four)
conflict on key points and disagree with Starr's selective
characterizations of their information.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast to the solemnity and care taken during Watergate 24
years ago could not be more complete, or more damning.

THE SEED AND THE EGG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the election results in Massachusetts last
month (November) could be taken as the repudiation of an old
progressive dream by a new one _ the dream of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   First voters obliterated _ by a ratio of four to one _ the
80-year-old distinction between ``earned'' and ``unearned'' income.
It was the largest ``yes'' vote in the history of ballot
initiatives. They backed a decision by the Legislature last summer
to roll back the old 12 percent tax on savings and investment
income to the same 5.95 percent that workers pay on wages. (That
was Question 3 on the ballot.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, citizens ratified the state's plan to deregulate publicly
traded electric utilities. Price competition in electricity rates
will begin in earnest next year. (That was Question 4.)
</P>
<P>
   In a state long noted for its enthusiasm for progressive
taxation _ in which many traditional modes of government regulation
of commerce and banking literally were invented _ such measures run
pretty strongly against perceived stereotypes. Look a little
deeper, however, and you'll find the state remained true to form.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the double tax on savings &UR;  &LR; and investment income is
the third and final triumph for those, led by former Governor
William Weld, who have sought to bring Massachusetts' tax profile
into line with other states. It follows recent reductions in
inheritance taxes (1994) and in the treatment of long-term capital
gains (starting in 1996.) ``This was the last sore thumb.'' says
Michael Widmer, executive director of the Massachusetts Taxpayers
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Only the cumbersome oversight by the attorney general of the
Division of Revenue's conduct of tax administration remains to be
eliminated before ``Taxachusetts'' ceases to exist as a statistical
fact.
</P>
<P>
   No one who believes that the keys to economic growth are peace,
low taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice can be sorry
to see the prohibitive 12 percent tax bracket go. It is difficult
to retain a highly skilled work force and foster the kind of
economic development that benefits the poor when taxes are
seriously out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Look a little harder at what happened in November, however, and
you may conclude that Massachusetts once again is in the vanguard
of those seeking the betterment of the human condition. Doubling
the income tax exemption (from $4,400 to $8,800 for couples filing
jointly) and thereby maintaining a degree of progressivity,
important though it was, was the least of it.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away on the ballot last month was an initiative that
points the way to serious political reform in the 21st century.
That was Question 2, a mechanism for socializing the funding of
elections, which passed by a 2-1 ratio. The Clean Elections
Initiative befits an American community that for nearly 400 years
has distinguished itself among all the others by a pair of traits:
ingenuity and its social conscience. The Clean Elections Initiative
was designed to short-circuit the power of money to buy elections
through lavish campaign contributions. Statewide candidates who
raise modest qualifying funds receive public funding for the rest
of their campaigns, within agreed-upon spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to spend more may raise it privately _ but
opponents would recieve comparable support from public funds.
``Soft'' money _ contributions funneled through party organizations
_ would be banned. Such a mechanism could begin to restore the
balance between public and private. It could serve eventually as a
model for the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to feel much sorrow about the demise of the double
tax rate on investment income. It was based on an outmoded and
ultimately wrong idea about the sources of economic growth. The
voters who repudiated it by such a lopsided margin clearly were
influenced by the 15-year boom in asset prices _ and the fact that
mutual funds have surpassed banks as a vehicle for savings. But it
is Question 2 that was exciting, even though many impediments
remain. The Legislature, which is generally opposed to it, must
appropriate the funds for its implementation, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, the poet James Russell Lowell discerned in the
rise of the New England town meeting the law of unintended
consequences: ``Puritanism, believing itself quick with the seed of
religious liberty, laid without knowing it, the egg of democracy.''
The tax revolt may have done something of the sort in our own time.

<P>
   We should all be this loved.
</P>
<P>
   Months after it was formed by the merger of two smaller
companies, Concentra Managed Care Inc. of Boston had won over the
stock brokerages and institutional investors who work Wall Street
with breathtaking success.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra, which helps manage workers' compensation cases for
corporate clients, made the Zacks Investors Service monthly list of
most widely recommended stocks early this year. First Call Corp.
pinpoints the apex of Concentra's popularity as Jan. 12, when 13
brokerage analysts carried ``strong buy'' recommendations and four
others rated it a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentra's list of leading institutional owners read like a
who's who of aggressive growth mutual funds: two big Putnam
Investments funds owned a combined 4.6 million shares. T. Rowe
Price New Horizons, AIM Constellation, and AIM Aggressive Growth
were also among 13 funds that each owned more than 500,000 shares
of Concentra.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed. Concentra's performance faltered, though not
drama-tically. Then its chief executive departed abruptly. Many big
investors fled, and the stock plunged by nearly 80 percent from
January highs in its darkest moments. Perhaps worst of all, a
series of unpleasant surprises has damaged the credibility of
Concentra's managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got a period of three to nine months in which it is
a show-me stock,'' said Brian Stack, a mutual fund manager at
Massachusetts Financial Services who owns a large block of
Concentra. ``Given all the ambiguities in the market in general and
in health care in particular, it's kind of cast a pall over the
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Concentra has formed a special board committee and
hired investment bankers to evaluate unsolicited offers from
unidentified suitors. A New York venture capital firm, involved
with two public health care companies taken private this year, has
acquired 4.3 million Concentra shares in the last two months and
left its options open in public securities filings.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, Carson, Anderson &AMP; Stowe, which now owns about 10 percent
of Concentra's stock, struck a $290 million deal last month to take
private Centennial Healthcare Corp. of Atlanta and this summer
joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. to pull off a similar
arrangement with Medcath Inc. of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, Carson has more than a passing interest in Concentra and
its managers. It helped fund one of the two merged firms that
created the company and one of its executives sat on Concentra's
board before resigning in May. Welsh, Carson also invested $38
million this year in Magella Healthcare Corp., a private
neonatology physician practice management firm operated by John K.
Carlyle, Concentra's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra chief executive Dan Thomas, named to that post just
six weeks ago, said the board committee was examining offers and
would soon be presented with an operating budget for 1999. ``The
board and the special committee have to evalute that,'' Thomas
said. ``They are valuing the company and deciding what makes the
most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe Concentra still has a reasonably bright
future, though not at the pace of growth that was once assumed. But
even they aren't sure how long the battered stock would need to
recover and whether it's worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about a young company facing stern
punishment by the market for its missteps. In fact, Concentra
became a textbook example of how the market can embrace and drop
growing companies with the subtlety of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra was created in the summer of 1997 by the merger of two
companies that did not compete but worked the same kind of clients.
</P>
<P>
   CRA Managed Care of Boston and its chief, Donald Larson,
administered and managed workers' compensation cases, oversight
that could help limit expenses and get employees back on the job
faster. Occusystems Inc. was a Texas-based physician practice
management company that specialized in treating workers' comp
patients. Carlyle was the chief executive and Thomas served as his
number two at Occusystems.
</P>
<P>
   Their merger made Concentra the biggest company in its field.
Practice management companies were hot on Wall Street and the case
administration was seen as an engine for internal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Larson took over as chief executive of the combined company.
Carlyle became chairman, but gave up the position months later, and
Thomas became president by January. In the first quarters,
Concentra committed one of the most dangerous acts for a young
public company. It beat Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last. Concentra's results for the second quarter of
1998 disappointed and analysts began to worry, mostly about the
company's physician practice management.
</P>
<P>
   Concentra shares, which had traded above 30 through most of the
spring, plunged to their lowest point on Sept. 8 when the firm
announced third-quarter performance would fall short of
expectations and more problems were expected in the final quarter.
Concentra stock fell to 6 3/32 that day, but even more problems
were about to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Larson resigned without explanation and, by
Sept. 25, had given up his board seat. Carlyle returned as chairman
and, with Thomas moving up, reformed the team that had run
Occusystems. Thomas declined to comment on the management change
and Larson did not recall a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, guidance Concentra managers had given to
institutional investors and analysts about the third quarter proved
to be wrong. Earnings were even worse than expected and problems
that had never been discussed suddenly surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty significant disappointment,'' said analyst
Robert Mains of Advest Inc. ``Concentra had been billed as a
company that could sustain 30 percent growth and I think that was
overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts today are reluctant to recommend Concentra, but
most like its business. Mains offers a buy recommendation, but that
has as much to do with the prospects of sale as anything else. Most
believe Concentra stock, which finished Monday at 11 13/16, would
be worth 15 per share or perhaps more in a deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One possible wild card in Concentra's future: Larson. He still
owns about 1.7 million shares and could influence how and whether a
deal takes place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity watcher Eric Kobren, who once worked for money manager
Scott Black's Delphi Management Inc. in Boston, has enlisted his
old friend to run a mutual fund. The fund, Kobren Delphi Value,
marks the first time Kobren Insight Management in Wellesley has
teamed with an outside manager. Kobren Insight now offers three
mutual funds, which invest in other funds. Delphi manages about $1
billion in institutional assets.

MARADONA RETAINS BOLDNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a serendipity about two of the most outspoken figures
in Italian soccer being at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Maradona and Zdenek Zeman did not come close to meeting,
however. Maradona was in the VIP section with his wife, Claudia
Villafanes, and advisers. He had returned to Italy for the first
time in seven years, thanks mostly to Zeman, who was on the field,
coaching AS Roma to a 3-3 tie with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman's observations about drugs in Italian soccer led to a
judicial inquiry, lifting the lid off some scandalous coverups,
similar to the charges Maradona made when he was suspended for
cocaine use in 1991. Maradona returned to testify in Turin and to
collect more than $300,000 for appearing on a television variety
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw me out the window like a delinquent,'' Maradona
said upon his return. ``Now, I want to return through the front
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Maradona always has claimed that drug testing is selective, and
that he was a victim of a conspiracy. Certainly, the singling out
and banning of Maradona during the 1994 World Cup was an obvious
punishment for his campaign against former FIFA president Joao
Havelange. Maradona claimed to have purchased an over-the-counter
spray containing ephedrine from a Tremont Street pharamacy. After
Argentina's 2-1 win over Nigeria at Foxboro Stadium, he was
selected for a ``random'' test, then banned.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Maradona tested positive for cocaine while playing for
Napoli in 1991. He departed in disgrace, returned in good form for
USA '94, and with teams in Argentina and Spain, but mostly has been
discredited and ignored by the powers that be ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona is not an angel, though millions of Neapolitans regard
him as a deity, but his contention about selective enforcement has
proven to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigating judge, Raffaele Guariniello, started
proceedings, the head of the drug-testing center at Aqua Acetosa
has resigned, there have been revelations of urine samples
disappearing, and positive tests being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona always has made establishment figures uncomfortable,
sometimes because of his lower-class background, more often because
he is un-afraid to state his unvarnished comments. Few sided with
him when he was down.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Maradona has continued to attack soccer's
hierarchy. Now, his words have a better chance of being seriously
considered. But there is a danger that Maradona _ like Zeman _ will
be portrayed as a prophet of doom.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a Maradona acolyte to admire his boldness.
He retains the directness, the street smarts, and ingenuousness of
his background. Maradona is described as a ``rebel with a cause''
by Argentine author Sergio Levinsky, who notes that Maradona is
uncomfortable with compromise and diplomacy, unlike Pele, the man
he succeeded as the king of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Maradona possesses saintly qualities _ the ability to
attract a massive following, to inspire through almost magical
conjuring abilities on the field. After he was placed on an
unrealistically high pedestal, many forces emerged to bring him
down. The enormous amount of money that was invested in gambling on
Napoli, much of it in the black market, virtually trapped Maradona.
He also signed a long-term contract that further restricted his
freedom. Eventually, the only escapes Maradona could find were
self-destruction and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should Maradona be crucified for drug use or Zeman shot as
the messenger of bad news. There have been major problems with
drugs in soccer for many years.
</P>
<P>
   At the top levels, soccer is a punishing game, and players are
pushed beyond reasonable limits for the purpose of generating more
money. Recently, the influences of television have increased the
pressure for more games, and a fast-er-paced game, which could be
taking an even greater physical toll.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Maradona easily can become addicted to
pain-killing injections. Dependence on other drugs is a natural
progression.
</P>
<P>
   As Maradona testified, his cocaine use was ``a personal problem.
Cocaine certainly did not help me play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, unlike size-and-strength-based sports such as basketball
and football, still places a premium on skill and tactical
awareness. This gives it a built-in resistance to rampant use of
so-called ``performance-enhancing'' anabolic steroids. But this
resistance erodes as more emphasis is placed on physicality over
technique. Substances such as creatine have become popular to help
increase muscle mass, others to accelerate recovery from injury.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona came from the poorest sections of Lanus, on the
outskirts of Buenos Aires. He now stays in the most expensive
hotels on the Via Veneto in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Should Maradona be obliged to set a saintly example for all? Or
should he simply be accepted as a flawed human being with
exceptional athletic talent and the courage to speak the truth?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Argentina celebrates
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Argentina hardly missed Maradona. His former team,
Boca Juniors, won the Apertura Championship for the first time
since 1992 and has a 12-0-5 record with two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Boca's clinching 0-0 tie with Independiente, millions of
fans began celebrating across the country. Boca supporters claim
more than half of Argentina's 31 million population, and the
estimate is only slightly exaggerated. One fan died of heart
failure at La Bombonera, Boca's stadium, an Uruguayan fan was shot
in a Buenos Aires suburb, and dozens of arrests were made around
the country. Two days before the game, a 6-year-old student was
expelled from school for dying his hair in the shape of a
blue-and-gold (Boca's colors) heart.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster was inspired by striker  &UR; Martin Palermo &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is
certain to be transferred to an Italian or Spanish club. Also on
the way to Europe could be  &UR; Carlos Bianchi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been
mentioned as a replacement for Barcelona coach  &UR; Louis Van
Gaal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; if Barca wants to honor Van Gaal's $5.7 million buyout
clause. Bianchi struggled with AS Roma and likely wants another
chance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Another Argentine coach on the rise is  &UR; Enzo Trossero &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is
interested in moving to the US. Trossero, 45, has been head coach
at Sion in Switzerland, and Huracan, Estudiantes de La Plata, Colon
de Santa Fe, and San Martin de Tucuman in Argentia.

   Celebrities get to travel a lot. But that doesn't mean they're
always aware of their surroundings, as evidenced in these quotes
from ``Stupid Celebrities: Over 500 of the Most Idiotic Things Ever

</P>
<P>
   _``New Jersey?'' _ actress Tori Spelling, when asked what the
capital of New York is.
</P>
<P>
   _``I can't really remember the names of the clubs we went to.''
_ basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, when asked if he visited the
Parthenon while in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   _``Out here, young man, we pronounce it Ohio.'' _ producer Sam
Goldwyn, after a newly signed actor told him he was from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   _``Somewhere near Africa.'' _ singer-actor Barbra Streisand,
describing where Rangoon is.
</P>
<P>

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about
other countries.'' _ Aldous Huxley.

he once tried to get a meal late at night in Rome but was told,
``The chicken is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Big bucks: &LR;  For $1.5 million, you can book the 155-room Fizpatrick

<P>
   One of the best things about the holiday season is that it
provides a good excuse to get away for a weekend filled with
relaxing things to do and the holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   New England resort towns in particular love to hold holiday
strolls _ weekends filled with caroling, festivities, and shopping
far from the crowded malls. You might even save money on the
shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   Such festivities are all the more interesting when you consider
Christmas wasn't celebrated until the 1830s in puritanical New
England.
</P>
<P>
   In its earliest days, Bethlehem ``was clothed with primeval
upland grandeur and beautified by nature's own adornment,'' an 1883
history noted. This Bethelem is in New Hampshire, and it was named
on Dec. 25, 1799. The weekend of Dec. 4-6 is an ideal time to
visit. The town will be festive, you can send your cards with a
Bethlehem postmark (the post office is staying open late on Dec.
5), and there are farms where you can cut your own tree. Weekend
events include a crafts fair, a homes and inns tours ($10), a gala
dinner ($20 adult, $10 children) followed by a gingerbread house
auction on Dec. 4, children's activities, snow sculpting, and more.
For complete information and ticket purchases, call the Bethlehem
Chamberof Commerce at 603-869-3409.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem lives also in Connecticut. The 18th annual Bethlehem
Christmas Town Festival will be Dec. 4 from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. and
Dec. 5 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There will be arts and crafts, music,
and the opportunity to have your cards mailed with an
artist-designed cachet from the Bethlehem Post Office, where for 60
years more than 250,000 people have had their cards posted. (If you
can't make it to Bethlehem, Postmaster Joan Manzi said her staff is
happy to receive packages of cards, open them, and then stamp
individually; for details, call 203-266-7910). Other festivities
include open houses, a tree lighting, and a visit to the
17th-century Neapolitan creche at the Abbey of Regina Laudis on
Flanders Road. More than 80 porcelain figures preside over the
Madonna and Christ Child. Next door at the Abbey's Little Art Shop
are some wonderful handmade Christmas gifts. Also available in
Bethlehem is a limited edition pewter Christmas ornament produced
by Carey Cabin Pewter. For more information on Bethlehem's
festival, call 203-266-5557.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Litchfield Hills area is an open house tour of
Washington, Conn., homes on Dec. 12 (call 860-567-4162 for
details), and from Dec. 12-23 the annual Hands On Toy Train Display
will be held at the Railroad Station in New Milford. For
information on those activities, lodging, and other events, call
the Litchfield Hills Travel Council at 860-567-4506.
</P>
<P>
   In New London, N.H., ``Christmas in Our Towns'' offers all the
festivities plus shopping discounts. Festivities begin Dec. 4 at 5
p.m. with a twilight parade down Main Street, followed by caroling
and events at a Christmas Village designed by Tomie de Paola, a
children's author/illustrator and resident. On Dec. 5 and 6, there
will be a Christmas Walk &AMP; Ski. Shoppers buying a special button
for $3 get to save 10 percent on purchases at participating stores,
and on Dec. 6 the button allows skiing at Mount Sunapee Resort for
just $20. Button sales ?proceeds? and part of the lift ticket price
go to a local charity. For a complete guide to these and other
December events, call toll free, 877-526-6575.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Snow in southern Vermont marks the Nights Before Christmas
through Dec. 24. There will be visits by Santa Lucia and her
helpers, tree lightings, a live nativity manger, fanciful
gingerbread houses, snowmobile races, snowboarding events, and the
Women's East Cup Slalom ski competition. Mount Snow is about 2 1/2
hours from Boston. For more information on events and lodging, call
toll free 877-VTSOUTH.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket island modestly claims that walking through the town
of Nantucket on any December day makes one feel like a character in
a Dickens novel. Curtis Barnes, Nantucket's town crier for the last
24 years, goes farther, saying, ``Nantucket during December is the
remedy for the `bah humbugs.''' Nantucket's Noel festivities
continue through New Year's Eve and include theatrical and choral
performances, concerts, holiday and crafts shows, and the annual
Gingerbread House competition. Nantucket's famed stroll is Dec.4-6,
with most events on Dec. 5. With only 1,200 licensed hotel/guest
rooms on the island, accommodations book fast. For last-minute
reservations, call Visitor Services at 508-228-0925. The island is
easily reached by airplane and ferry, including a one-hour
high-speed ferry service.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the best holiday celebrations is held on Cape
Cod in the picturesque village of Sandwich _ the oldest town on the
Cape. Festivities run from Dec. 3 through Dec. 12 and include
caroling by candlelight, a live Nativity scene, holiday home tours,
a door decorating contest, church fairs, open house in shops,
seasonal plays, visits with Santa Claus, distinctly decorated
museums, and a Jingle Bell Walk. For a complete schedule of events,
call the Cape Cod Canal Region Chamber of Commerce at 508-759-6000.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Plantation (508-888-3300) will be open with free
admission Dec. 5 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Dec. 6 from noon to 4
p.m. with a holiday boutique featuring handmade crafts, pictures
with Santa in the museum's 1913 Ford Touring Car (at noon on both
days), decorated trees, and a special exhibit by the Barnstable
County Garden Railway Society.

   Most events are repeated both weekends in Sandwich. Bring your
Christmas cards and have them sent with a special Sandwich

   Just up Route 6A, you might also want to take in the Yarmouth
Port Christmas Stroll on Dec. 6 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The
bed-and-breakfast innkeepers will offer tours, the Yarmouth
Colonial Minutemen will be marching, there will be music,

<P>
   In the Berkshires, Stockbridge will have its ninth annual
Holiday House tour Dec. 5 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. as one part of its
weekend-long Stockbridge Main Street at Christmas. The weekend is
inspired by Norman Rockwell's famous painting of the Main Street
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you'd like to see New England before it celebrated
Christmas, head to Old Sturbridge Village, where the 1830s village
will mark ``The Beginnings of a New England Christmas'' from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., Dec. 6, 13, and 20.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Larkin, the village's director of research,
the Puritans who founded New England held profound religious
convictions and were determined to ``prune away'' everything not
directly commanded or described in the Bible. The Bible never gives
the date of the birth of Christ, and most Puritans considered
Christmas a pagan festival. In the 1830s, Larkin noted, New
Englanders were just hearing about Christmas in ``far off places
like New York'' and perhaps worrying that their children might
accept Christmas and abandon their Puritan traditions.
</P>
<P>
   So, head out to Old Sturbridge Village and learn more about the
holiday's origins, enjoy 19th-century parlor games, hearthside
tales, music, and dance, and stroll the candle-litvillage at dusk.
Old Sturbridge is located near the intersection of the Mass. Pike
and Interstate 84. For information, call 800-SEE 1830.

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR CHALKS UP TRAVEL MILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has racked up more than
75,000 international travel miles in his three years in office,
perhaps more than any of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown on Tuesday began a three-day trade mission to Mexico, his
first excursion south of the border as mayor. He has made six
previous trips out of the country, traveling four times to Asia and
twice to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the mayor stopped in London, Paris and Frankfurt on
a mission to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
   None of the trips has been at taxpayer expense because a fee,
paid by other travelers in his delegations, covers the mayor and
his City Hall staff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not the first mayor to globe-trot. Dianne Feinstein,
now the senior senator from California, traveled on several
occasions to Africa, Asia and Europe, said Hadley Roff, a deputy
mayor in the Feinstein administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she traveled four or five times to the Far East
because of sister city relationships,'' he said. ``China opened the
first American consulate in San Francisco and established direct
flights'' partly because of her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Roff said the late Joseph Alioto went to Mexico, and Frank
Jordan, who may challenge Brown in next year's mayoral race, made
two trips to Asia and one to Mexico during his four years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled only as issues presented themselves,'' Jordan said.
``I believe in international business. I went on trips when it was
beneficial to the city. There were no casual trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich DeLeon, a political science professor at San Francisco
State University, said it is Brown's job to maintain the city's
place as a world-class city by establishing relationships around
the world, particularly with Pacific-Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling is a definite source of criticism, especially if he
doesn't explain it clearly to voters,'' DeLeon said. ``But the
mayor will have to deal with the local provincial bias. San
Francisco is way beyond potholes and lamp posts. It's concerned
about where it is in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few years, San Francisco will have more to do with Tokyo
and Seoul than it has with Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown defended his travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses and companies have benefited handsomely,'' he said.
``There's been more than $50 million in joint venture agreements,
airline routes, a Taipei port agreement and on and on.''

<P>
   &UR; Merger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-MOBIL (Undated) _ Ledeall: Exxon buys Mobil for $77.4
billion in stock, the biggest takeover ever. The companies say they
plan $2.8 billion in annual cost reductions but give no details
about layoffs; analysts expect that more than 10,000 jobs will be
cut. The combined company will have 22 percent of the nation's
gasoline market and will refine more oil than any other company in
the world. It will rank at the top of the Fortune 500. The merger
reunites the biggest pieces of John D. Rockfeller's Standard Oil
monopoly. Exxon's chief executive, Lee Raymond, will be chairman
and chief executive of the new company, and Mobil's chief
executive, Lucio Noto, will be vice chairman. By Allen R. Myerson
and Agis Salpukas.

clash: Uniting a collection of terse engineers and loquacious
energy ambassadors won't be easy. By Agis Salpukas.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Having already been the target in
two of the biggest antitrust cases in history _ the 1911 breakup
and the oil cartel cases of the 1950s and 1960s _ Exxon and Mobil
now face a three-dimensional legal fight: against state attorneys
general, federal regulators and the European Commission. By Stephen
Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-CONSUMERS (Undated) _ Unlikely as it may seem, the merger
of the nation's two biggest oil companies is likely to benefit
consumers more than harm them, consumer groups and other industry
watchers say. By Robert D. Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ Nowhere will the merged company have a
vaster reach than in Asia, where the two own and operate oil
fields, refineries, pipelines, and gas stations from the arctic
chill of Sakhalin Island, Siberia to the tropical swelter of Natuna
Island, Indonesia. By Mark Landler.

   RHONE-HOECHST (Undated) _ As expected, Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst
agree to combine their drug, pesticide and seed units in what may
be a prelude to a full merger. Analysts remain unimpressed. By
David J.Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-MERGERS (Strasbourg, France) _ The idea behind any merger
is that bigger is better. But behind many of the recent deals in
Europe is something else: weakness. Although the pressures vary for
different companies, many analysts believe that one of the big
reasons for the urge to merge is low inflation: Unable to raise
their prices, and sometimes forced to cut them, companies in almost
every branch of industry can no longer deliver the nominal growth
in profits that shareholders are demanding. Further, many European
companies are facing serious competitive weaknesses. By Edmund L.
Andrews.

fell 5 percent in Frankfurt, 3.4 percent in London, 4.4 percent in
Brazil and 1.4 percent in Mexico. On the American debt market, the
long bond was up 21/32 point at midday, with the yield at 5.03

MCGEGAN AND ORCHESTRA MAKE MERRY WITH HAYDN, STRAUSS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As music director of San Francisco's acclaimed
Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, English conductor Nicholas McGegan
is closely associated with the operas, oratorios and concertos of
the Baroque era.
</P>
<P>
   That his experience and musical sympathies extend far beyond
that era has been evident in his appearances with the Houston
Symphony. The latest was a charming evening of music by Elgar,
Haydn and Richard Strauss, heard Saturday evening in Jones Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners could savor the performance of Haydn's ``Military''
Symphony (No. 100) for a very long time. Buoyant, brisk and tautly
unveiled, it nonetheless showed that Haydn's music was not merely
an exemplary model of classical form.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction, for example, McGegan established a mood of
crisp, elegant intimacy that was perfect preparation for ominous
interjection soon to follow from the winds. Here was music with
great drama and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname ``Military'' comes from Haydn's use of the bass
drum, cymbal and triangle in the second movement.
</P>
<P>
   The regular occurrence of such music in Haydn's period reflected
the then-current Viennese craze for Turkish things (as well as the
lurking military threat of the Ottoman Empire in the nearby Balkan
peninsula). As late as the early 1820s, the idiom popped up in the
last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Thought similar ``militaristic'' elements occur elsewhere in the
symphony, for McGegan it was an occasion for almost happy-go-lucky
music-making _ a celebration in the spirit of the holidays.
Propulsive tempos, brilliantly clear textures and a sure sense of
pacing brought sustained listening pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason McGegan could achieve the transparency and
crispness was the reduced-size orchestra available during the
holiday week. The other was the consistently fine playing.
</P>
<P>
   McGegan put both to splendid use in Strauss' Suite from ``Le
Bourgeois gentilhomme,'' written for a chamber orchestra (36
players Saturday evening).
</P>
<P>
   The suite emerged from an odd project now principally known for
the opera ``Ariadne auf Naxos.'' In 1912, Strauss and librettist
Hugo von Hofmannsthal staged an opera-within-a-play centered on the
Moliere comedy ``Le Bourgeois gentilhomme.''
</P>
<P>
   The project flopped because the evening was too long, and few
people attending it could decide whether it was drama or opera. So
Strauss retrieved the opera and, later, a suite of incidental music
for the play itself.
</P>
<P>
   The suite reflects both Strauss' superb skills of orchestration
and his equally sure instinct for conveying drama, character and
mood through music. Here, it is chock-full of interesting sounds
and funny aural descriptions, as in the lumbering gait heard in
``The Entrance and Dance of the Tailors.''
</P>
<P>
   The suite's core spirit is intimate, centered musically on the
frequent playing of string soloists. The first-chair violin has an
extensive solo part, and concertmaster Uri Pianka played with
gritty commitment, balanced by the more poignant playing of
principal cellist Desmond Hoebig.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall impact came from playing that was zestful and
sonically brilliant. Despite a lack of subtle Straussian finesse
from McGegan, the performance was a rewarding chance to hear
seldom-performed music.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment for me was Elgar's Introduction and
Allegro for strings. Mostly, the music seemed a little turgid,
perhaps because McGegan didn't sufficiently seek out a strong pulse
for the music.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as the violins careened along in extended
melodies, they lost rhythmic character because of the lack of
sufficient pulse. Even in calmer, slower music, the performance
didn't seem rhythmically energized.

LOVETT LOVINGLY RECALLS HIS ROOTS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Aerial Theater at Bayou Place and the Anderson
Fair folk club in Houston are separated by a 10-minute car ride.
But that distance can sum up a career for most local musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Lovett, one of the handful of Houston-based artists to
successfully complete the jump to national touring act, led a full
house of new and old fans back across that great divide Friday
night at the Aerial.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett's latest album, ``Step Inside This House,'' is a two-disc
salute to the Texas singer-songwriters he enjoyed and studied as an
aspiring artist hanging out at Anderson Fair and other local clubs
in the late '70s and early '80s. Most of his two-hour set was
devoted to songs from the album, which includes originals by Steve
Fromholz, Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, Eric Taylor, Vince Bell,
Walter Hyatt, Willis Alan Ramsey, David Rodriguez, Michael Martin
Murphey and Robert Earl Keen.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett saved a few favorites of his own _ ``If I Had a Boat,''
``Memphis,'' ``One Eyed Fiona'' _ for the latter part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Lovett has long since surpassed most of his
early inspirations, both in terms of commercial and creative
accomplishments. Song for song, the show might have been more
entertaining had Lovett featured more of his own material.
</P>
<P>
   But what a rare and beautiful thing it is to see a contemporary
artist give something back to the tradition in which he came up.
Lovett's idiosyncratic blend of upbeat country-swing and melancholy
folk-blues represents the dialectic between Hyatt and Van Zandt,
while his wry humor and narrative skills reflect the influence of
Fromholz, Clark and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   By reintroducing these regional heroes to his national audience,
Lovett has defined his own place in the tradition while extending a
helping hand to those who came before him.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett seemed relaxed and happy to be back among old fans,
friends and family members. Acknowledging the warm applause, he
observed, ``I know I'm kin to most of you, but I can't be kin to
all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett was backed by an eight-piece band, with bluegrass greats
Mike Auldridge on dobro and Sam Bush on mandolin joining Lovett's
longtime accompanists John Hagen on cello and James Gilmer on
percussion.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of bluegrass sweetheart Alison Krauss _ whose
brother Viktor plays bass in Lovett's band _ was an unexpected
treat. Krauss added angelic backup vocals on several songs and
contributed to the tight three-part harmony with Lovett and Bush on
the traditional bluegrass tune ``More Pretty Girls Than One.'' Too
bad Krauss had left her fiddle back in Nashville. It might have
been wonderful to hear her try some Texas-style twin fiddling with
Gene Elders, on loan from George Strait's Ace In the Hole Band.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on songs by other writers, Lovett inevitably calls
attention to his underrated vocal skills. His singing on Ramsey's
humorous ``Sleepwalking'' swung smoothly, while he brought out the
subtle intensity in Van Zandt's ``Flying Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he remained true to the singer-songwriter dictum that the
song comes before the singer and never imposed his style on the
material. He seemed to take special care with Fromholz's ``Texas
Trilogy,'' which honors the small-town, agricultural lifestyle
Lovett himself experienced growing up in the Klein area north of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing ``This Old Porch,'' a song he co-wrote with Keen
back in his collegiate days, Lovett apologized to anyone from
College Station, Texas, who might have been offended by their
Sunday-morning serenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to learn how to talk and play guitar at the
same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's come a long way since then, from struggling local act to
international celebrity. But Lovett's musical heart is still out on
that porch, inviting all who pass by to step inside this house of
Texas music. &QL;

NO-FRILLS `FUNNY GIRL' WORKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Every musical contains a make-or-break moment early on
that indicates whether the show will fly or fall.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Funny Girl,'' the classic backstage musical based on the
life of entertainer Fanny Brice, it's the title character's first
song, ``I'm the Greatest Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Ousted from auditions at a neighborhood music hall because she
is not chorus-girl ``pretty,'' the teen-age Fanny determinedly
pleads with Eddie, the sympathetic dance director, for another
crack at a spot in the show. As her song builds from its tentative
beginning, Jule Styne's propulsive music and Bob Merrill's wryly
conversational lyrics build into a clarion cry for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1964 Broadway original, with Barbra Streisand in the role
that would catapult her to international fame (as in the show's
1968 film version), the number worked like gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   In Stages' current intimate production, Holli Golden makes the
moment her own and makes it come vibrantly alive not only with the
brash power of her singing but also with the tension between her
uncertainty and determination to succeed. Golden never imitates
Streisand but projects her own humor and warmth as she veers from
playful self-deprecation to self-assured bravado. As required, by
the song's finish she has convinced not only Eddie but the audience
as well that this kid deserves a chance.
</P>
<P>
   And then another nice thing happens. Both director Rob Bundy's
resourcefully spare treatment of this much-loved musical and
Golden's appealing performance in the all-important starring role
just keep getting better as the evening progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny Girl'' is an interesting case: a huge hit that is rarely
produced _ perhaps because the demanding title role, tricky to cast
in its own right, remains so strongly associated with Streisand. It
underscores the fact that the lion's share of the musical
repertoire (even many big hits) continues to go neglected. If
enterprising midsize theaters like Stages can find a way to do
these full-scale Broadway shows, more power to them. They make
meatier programming than most of the pocket-size off-Broadway
novelties that smaller theaters usually attempt (``Nunsense,''
``Forever Plaid'' and so forth).
</P>
<P>
   As Stages' production demonstrates, with the right actress in
the spotlight, a no-frills ``Funny Girl'' works (even without
Streisand).
</P>
<P>
   True, the whole show is set squarely in the time-honored
tradition of backstage bios: the struggle to achieve success; the
thrill of newfound fame; the agony of backstage heartbreak. In
Fanny's case, that means keeping up the brave front performing in
the Ziegfeld Follies, while her rocky marriage to smooth-talking,
big-dealing gambler Nick Arnstein disintegrates. In the final
reprise of ``Don't Rain on My Parade,'' as Fanny wipes away tears
and prepares to storm out onstage, Merrill's lyrics sum up the
whole story: ``Let's give 'em hell, Brice/We'll cry a little
later/Well, Brice/That's life in the the-ater.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all familiar but neatly crafted. Isobel Lennart's book gets
the story across with earthy humor and reliable heart-tugs. Lennart
was a pro at this sort of thing. By the time she got around to
``Funny Girl,'' she had written the screenplay for ``Love Me or
Leave Me,'' chronicling Ruth Etting's onstage triumph and offstage
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Styne, one of Broadway's giants, was in top form for ``Funny
Girl,'' and very much in his natural habitat _ remember another
gritty Styne backstager called ``Gypsy''? Styne's strong feeling
for the theater world of this period, the color and zest of his
music, are indispensable assets of ``Funny Girl.'' This holds true
in pastichelike onstage numbers like the wedding extravaganza ``His
Love Makes Me Beautiful'' and the World War I patriotic ditty
``Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat'' and even more in the character ballads such as
``People'' and ``Who Are You Now?'' Merrill's lyrics likewise seem
to have the atmosphere and character nailed down perfectly, adding
fun with outbursts of those antic Merrill rhymes: ``Kid, my heart
ain't made of marble/But your rhythm's really horr'ble.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonus is that (save for one minor number) Stages has put
back the entire Broadway score _ about half of which was dropped
from the film version. That restores a lot of terrific material
that will seem new to patrons familiar only with the movie _
including such gems as Fanny's torch song ``The Music That Makes Me
Dance,'' one of Styne's best ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Staging a little production of a big show, Bundy wields both
feeling and skill. He demonstrates that, despite the few
Ziegfeldian routines to represent Fanny's ``Follies'' career,
``Funny Girl'' is essentially an intimate saga: Fanny and her
mother, Fanny and Nick, Fanny at the mirror in her backstage
dressing room. Not only is nothing lost, but the emotion of these
moments comes across more powerfully in the intimate framework.
</P>
<P>
   Golden rises to the occasion of her challenging task as Fanny.
Starting out playful and affable, she gradually reveals the womanly
yearning, the tough pragmatism of a gal who will finagle behind
hubby's back if she thinks it might boost his career and save her
marriage. And since Styne and Merrill bestowed Fanny with one of
the most generous programs of songs in Broadway history, Golden
sings her heart out _ lowdown in ``Cornet Man,'' tender in
``People,'' driving in ``Don't Rain on My Parade,'' comical in
``Sadie, Sadie,'' wounded yet defiant in ``The Music That Makes Me
Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about the stage version is that, while ``Funny
Girl'' still is Fanny's show, other characters do get a look-in (in
the film version, almost no one else did).
</P>
<P>
   David Grant makes a dapper-looking, smooth-singing Nick. As his
business and marriage go sour in the second act, Grant gives the
dramatic scenes the needed gravity; from the look on his face and
the tone of his voice, the problems seem real.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan McVay proves a snappy song-and-dance man as Eddie and
adds a dramatic dimension by showing that the guy carries a
lifelong torch for his pal Fanny.
</P>
<P>
   Peg Glazer contributes a rich and colorful characterization as
Rose Brice, Fanny's well-meaning, tart-tongued mother. William
Hardy makes an authoritative Flo Ziegfeld. Melinda deKay is all
fussy, meddlesome concern as neighbor Mrs. Strakosh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few rushed or cluttered spots here and there, Chesley
Santoro Krohn has supplied some enlivening choreography, especially
in that tap-happy WWI routine.
</P>
<P>
   Musical director Steven Jones leads a sensitive rendition of the
famous score. Thom Guthrie's production design, with detailed set
pieces moving in and out of the central proscenium arch on wagons,
is effective. Matthew Bartkowiak has created some pleasing period
costumes, particularly for the more glamorous Fanny of later scenes
(although those early ``ugly duckling'' bloomers may be a bit
problematic).
</P>
<P>
   All in all, there's little rain on the horizon for Stages'
winning ``Funny Girl.'' &QL;

FORM LETS INVESTOR GET QUESTIONS RIGHT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of readers ask how they can protect themselves against bad
advice from stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple enough: Ask lots and lots of questions and
keep good records of the broker's answers.
</P>
<P>
   So the next question is, what are the questions?
</P>
<P>
   The stock market watchdogs have come up with a new way to help
you get it right.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Securities Administrators Association in
Washington, D.C., the umbrella group of state securities
regulators, has developed a notepad for investors to help guide
them to ask the right questions while talking with a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors who keep good records of their dealings with their
brokers have a leg up in any dispute,'' said Peter C. Hildreth,
president of the association. ``While the vast majority of brokers
are honest, hard-working professionals, disputes do arise.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions cover two sides of a single sheet of paper. They
aren't technical. They prompt you to ask for basic information such
as the name of the broker, the date of the call, the nature of the
proposed investment, how it was described and the broker's name.
</P>
<P>
   The notepad contains crucial questions you should ask to help
judge the broker and an investment idea:
</P>
<P>
   Why is the broker making that particular recommendation?
</P>
<P>
   How does it fit in with your investment objectives?
</P>
<P>
   What are the risks?
</P>
<P>
   How will an investment make money? Is it going to offer income
from dividends or interest, or is it supposed to pay off with
capital gains?
</P>
<P>
   What are the total fees to purchase, maintain and sell this
investment? After you've added up those costs, find out how much
the investment has to gain in value before you break even.
</P>
<P>
   How long has the company that's issued a stock been in business?
Has it made money? Is the management experienced and has it been
successful in the past? Has it made money for investors before?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get the broker's number &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crucial piece of information that you should list on the form
is what is known as the broker's CRD number.
</P>
<P>
   That number can be used to look up a broker's record in the
Central Registration Depository. That is the computer database
operated by state securities regulators and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the brokerage industry's
self-regulatory organization.
</P>
<P>
   You should check this database to see if the broker and his or
her firm are registered in Texas and whether they've been
disciplined by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   To make that check, call the NASD's public disclosure hot line
at 800-289-9999 or the State Securities Board in Austin at
512-305-8300 during regular business hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not be doing business with a broker unless you've
checked out their CRD record,'' said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for
the national securities administrators.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask for information in writing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' information sheet also has spaces for you to
record whether you asked to receive written information on a
prospective investment (always ask) and what type of information
will be sent to you.
</P>
<P>
   The form enables you to record what you told the broker to do _
buy, sell or take no action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be vigilant and skeptical and remember that you're
dealing with your money and this is not a trivial matter,''
Beauchamp said. ``You're trying to determine if the person you're
talking to on the phone is experienced and trustworthy to handle
your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping thorough notes could mean the difference between winning
and losing a dispute against your broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, it's more of a `he said, she said' type of
problem, and the better records that the complainant who comes to
us has, the better we are positioned to clearly articulate the
nature of the problem and get a response that helps the investor,''
said Denise Crawford, Texas securities commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the customer has kept good records, the customer is much
more likely to get restitution from the brokerage firm,'' Crawford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come in with a shoebox full of records that aren't
organized or come with a hazy memory of a conversation that
occurred a year ago, you're going to be at a disadvantage when
you're up against a firm that has records,'' Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   You can print out a copy of the notepad from the association's
Web site at www.nasaa.org or order the form by calling
202-737-0900.

JURY AWARDS $2.3 MILLION TO FAMILY OF SLAIN INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal jury awarded more than $2.3 million to
the family of a convicted murderer who was shot dead by a San
Quentin prison guard, the latest rebuke of the state prison
system's use of deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of inmate Mark Adams is a former prison employee who
allegedly hid him after his escape and helped him find religion in
Puerto Rico. She said Monday that the verdict was divine justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave us justice,'' said Elsie Diaz, of Humacao, Puerto
Rico. ``I'm just so glad that maybe somebody will take notice and
see what goes on behind those prison doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 jurors on Monday unanimously found fault with the
California Department of Correction's policy on when guards may
shoot inmates and with the shooting death in 1994 of Adams, who had
been recaptured and returned to the prison.
</P>
<P>
   A corrections official expressed shock at the verdict and said
the award was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded a total of $2,302,500 against the state:
$465,000 in compensatory damages for Adams' lost life, wages and
companionship, and $1,837,500 in punitive damages to punish the
defendants and deter them and others from similar conduct in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman Robert Resner told reporters the jury was sending a
message to the corrections department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem with their firearms policy and a failure to
have less than lethal means'' of controlling inmates, he said. ``He
was a prisoner and a convicted murderer, but he shouldn't have been
killed. He was in the custody and care of the department. The
general feeling was that the state needed to get a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors concluded that San Quentin guard Timothy Scott
Reynolds _ an expert shot who allegedly boasted of killing Adams _
had either been grossly negligent in shooting Adams in the back of
the head from 25 feet, or meant to kill him, Resner said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was swayed by the testimony of Reynolds' former
girlfriend, a clerk for the Modesto Police Department who said
Reynolds ``bragged'' about killing Adams, Resner said. The state
did not challenge her testimony, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was convicted in 1982 of a murder and robbery he committed
when he was 16 and sentenced to 43 years to life. But on June 10,
1986, he escaped from San Quentin. Exactly how has never been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   He was recaptured in 1993 when a neighbor saw him on the
television program ``America's Most Wanted'' and phoned in a tip
leading the FBI to arrest him in Humacao. By then he had married
Diaz, who had supervised his prison work program.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of his return to San Quentin, Adams was shot by
Reynolds during a fight with another inmate in the prison's
high-security exercise yard under what his lawyers called
suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Adams' survivors sued the state, claiming that Reynolds
used excessive force and that the corrections department was the
nation's only law enforcement agency to maintain a ``sadistic''
policy allowing guards to shoot inmates to halt fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds and the department denied the allegations, saying the
shots were necessary. But after three days of deliberation in U.S.
District Judge William H. Orrick's San Francisco courtroom, the
jury disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is the latest finding that California's prison
system has used excessive force on inmates.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel of former law enforcement officials found
last month that 24 of 31 fatal or serious shootings at Corcoran
state prison from 1989 to 1995 were unjustified, and that the
state's system for investigating such incidents had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal ruled that guards at Pelican Bay state prison
needlessly and recklessly used firearms and engaged in
``staggering'' amounts of excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can no longer be any doubt that there is a severe
problem,'' said Steve Fama, a lawyer with the Prison Law Office, a
private prisoners' legal services group in San Rafael.

   ISRAEL-BUSH-1202 _ JERUSALEM _ In a helicopter tour led by
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
flew over the West Bank today, but did not touch down to visit
Jewish settlements as initially planned. Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, who advocates keeping control of strategic areas of the
West Bank, played guide for Bush and three other visiting U.S.
governors on a helicopter tour of the disputed territory, Israeli
officials said. An Israeli Foreign Ministry itinerary had listed a
visit to an observation point overlooking the Jewish settlement of
Alfei Menashe _ a spot where Israel's nearby coastal plain can be
seen _ but the helicopter did not put down. (Kaplow, Cox News

_ which draws students from the small towns and ranches east of
Laredo _ are relying on subsidized housing to lure new educators.
Resurrecting a practice that dates back to the frontier days, when
towns built living quarters for the schoolmarm, Webb Consolidated
Independent School District is offering teachers an apartment in a
district-owned complex next to the football field or in any one of
a dozen houses and mobile homes spread out over district property
in Bruni and nearby Oilton. The rent: $250 a month for two
bedrooms, $300 a month for three. (Harmon, Austin

Mainor Chiles Jr., first a state representative, then a state

Cracker expressions were foreign to many who understood little
about the ways of old Florida. Yet the same man who wore a coonskin
cap and fired a potato gun at his second inauguration also used his
1997 State of the State address to call attention to brain research
and the importance of a healthy early childhood. Don't expect him
to slow down, just because he lost re-election. An in-depth look at
a political legend. (Klas, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

politics. He spends several days a week at the ranch in Forney,
near Dallas, that he has owned since 1950. A profile of Clements,

   MEYER-LEMON (Undated) _ Many people go through life with a
single, vivid taste image of a lemon _ one of something acidic,
clean tasting and unforgivingly sharp. Unlike an orange, which has
dozens of flavors depending on the variety, the lemon has just one,
reliable note that sticks firmly in their mind. That is, until they
taste a Meyer lemon. This fruit, thought to be a cross between
either a lemon and an orange or a lemon and a mandarin, looks like
a lemon but with tight orange-yellow skin when it's ripe. And it
tastes more like a lemon with a gentle streak. Its sharpness is
softened with a beguiling sweetness and an intoxicating perfume
that's both floral and herbaceous, a little like rosemary. By
Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   WITHOUT-RECIPES (Undated) _ Nearly a decade ago, we were staying
with two other couples in a rented beach house, and the agreement
was that each of us would cook one meal. For mine, I was carrying a
photocopy of a time-tested recipe. I spent a sunny, breezy day
racing down supermarket aisles collecting ingredients. In the
kitchen, I played fast and loose with garlic and pepper, but
nothing could raise my shrimp-with-rice dish above the bland. The
next day's lunch was another couple's turn. After a lazy morning,
the wife sauntered into the kitchen saying she would make use of
leftovers. She swiftly transformed the remains from my meal,
flavoring the rice and shrimp with a little cumin from an ancient
bottle on the shelf. She, of course, got the applause that I had
suffered for. How did she do it, we asked. ``I just listen to what
the food tells me to do,'' she said. That was when I decided that I
too would learn to cook without recipes. By Polly Frost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When words like ``cure'' and ``prevention'' appear in the title
of a book about a chronic, disabling or life-threatening disease,
they often enrich authors and publishers at the public's expense.
Such is likely the case with a current best seller, ``The Breast
Cancer Prevention Diet'' by Dr. Bob Arnot, the medical
correspondent for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The book's premise _ that adopting a diet rich in soy, flaxseed
and fish oils can prevent breast cancer _ has been soundly
denounced by breast-cancer researchers and patient advocates alike
as promising something it cannot possibly deliver.
</P>
<P>
   As Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, put it, ``There is no breast-cancer prevention diet,''
and the basis for Arnot's assertion is too flimsy to warrant a
radical dietary shift based on a ``bet,'' as he put it, that it
will deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an onslaught of criticism, Arnot now says he should
have used the words ``risk reduction'' instead of ``prevention'' in
his book title.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the book overextends laboratory findings that have
yet to be confirmed in women, suggests dietary changes that have
not been tested for long-term safety, and intimates that, counter
to all rules of sound medical science, it is foolhardy to wait for
definitive proof of effectiveness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer-Diet Link
</P>
<P>
   Arnot is not wrong in suggesting that diet plays an important
role in the prevention of cancer, including breast cancer. The
American Cancer Society estimates that diet is a primary factor in
a third of cancer deaths. That estimate is derived from thousands
of studies of people worldwide and is supported by findings in
laboratory cell cultures and experimental animals.
</P>
<P>
   These studies suggest that a reorientation of American eating
habits _ to emphasize fruits, vegetables and whole grains and
minimize red meats, total fat and especially saturated fats and
alcohol _ can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing
most of the common cancers, like colon and rectum, lung, bladder,
stomach, esophagus, mouth, throat and breast.
</P>
<P>
   What cannot be said is that adopting a particular diet can
ensure that you won't get cancer, or that if you do, the diet will
prevent the cancer from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the American Institute for Cancer Research and the
World Cancer Research Fund released an analysis of more than 4,500
studies that examined the relationship between cancer and diet and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion, as summarized in the current issue of Nutrition
Action Health Letter: ``While there are no guarantees, there is
plenty you can do to cut your risk.'' Simply eating more fruits and
vegetables, for example, can eliminate about 20 percent of cancers,
the analysis suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important is that the recommended anti-cancer diet
is the very same diet that studies have shown can help to prevent
and treat heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, anyone who is interested in maximizing the
chances of staying healthy would be wise to consider adopting a
diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables that are loaded
with fiber, vitamins and minerals and other cancer-fighting
chemicals that occur naturally in plant foods.
</P>
<P>
   A protective diet would also be moderate in animal protein and
especially limited in red meats and low in fat, especially
saturated fat, simple sugars and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the low-carbohydrate plan advocated by Arnot,
such a diet is rich in carbohydrates _ not sugars, of course, but
the complex carbohydrates, or starchy foods, particularly in their
natural, unrefined, fiber-rich state.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a diet that can help fight obesity, which is
strongly linked to an increased risk of breast, uterine and other
cancers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dietary Do's
</P>
<P>
   The cancers most directly linked to diet are those that arise in
lining tissues throughout the body, especially cancers of the colon
and rectum, lung, bladder, stomach and, to a lesser extent, the
breast, uterus and prostate. The following dietary suggestions are
based on the strongest associations established in studies:
</P>
<P>
   FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Evidence in people has accumulated rapidly
in recent years to support the protective role of plant foods
against most cancers. The average American eats only about three or
four servings a day of vegetables and fruits, while five servings,
and preferably nine, are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Especially helpful are yellow, dark-green and orange vegetables
rich in carotenoids, fruits like citrus, tomatoes and strawberries
that are rich in vitamin C, and all the cabbage-family vegetables
like broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, collards, kale, bok
choy and mustard and turnip greens.
</P>
<P>
   Such foods are linked to lower risks of lung, stomach, colon and
rectum, oral-cavity, esophagus and, to a lesser degree, breast,
bladder, pancreas and larynx cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, onions and leeks contain allium compounds that help
prevent cancer, especially breast cancer. To reduce loss of the
protective chemicals, these vegetables should be cut up and allowed
to stand for 10 minutes before they are cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent findings suggest that the risk of prostate cancer
can be reduced by eating lots of cooked tomato products, including
ketchup, that are rich in a carotenoid called lycopene, and foods
rich in the mineral selenium, like meats, fish, grains and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   SOY AND OTHER DRIED BEANS These contain plant estrogens that may
be beneficial in preventing hormone-related cancers, including
breast, uterine and possibly ovarian cancer. A soy-rich diet may in
part explain why Asian women have a low risk of these cancers.
Dried beans may also help prevent colon cancer. But experts say
that beans are most likely to be protective when used in place of
meats and when the rest of the diet is low in fat.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE GRAINS Wheat bran in whole-grain cereals and breads is
strongly linked to protection against colon and rectal cancers,
probably because they speed the passage of wastes and reduce
exposure of the lower gut to cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER HELPFUL FOODS The list of possible dietary cancer weapons
keeps growing. Among recent additions are green tea, olive oil
(linked to a lower risk of breast cancer when used in place of
other fats) and milk and other foods rich in calcium and vitamin D
(linked to a reduced risk of breast and colon cancer).
</P>
<P>
   Though the evidence that flaxseed and fish oils can protect
against breast or any other cancer is still highly preliminary,
there are many other health benefits associated with eating more
fish.

 &HT;    Brews offer a ho-ho-whole lot of flavor

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, folks have left Santa Claus everything from
brownies and cookies to rum balls and hot chocolate. As midnight
snacks go, they beat a bowl of raisin bran, but why do we never
offer the man a drink? No one, to my knowledge, has affixed to the
fireplace a note that says, ``Help yourself to a beer. They're in
the fridge.''
</P>
<P>
   I should think he'd like one, working as hard as he does.
Granted, he's not going to stay on schedule if he lingers over it
too long. And there is, of course, the matter of sleighing drunk. A
beer at every other house, and he's going to be crashing his sled
and his reindeer through windows. We don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody at the end of his route should let him sit a spell
as the fire's embers glow warm and welcome.
</P>
<P>
   That's what winter beers are for, after all, and not just on
Christmas Eve. These are beers for firesides on a cold evening,
heartier and stronger than what you'd drink at a picnic. And if
snowmen and chimneys puffing white aren't a part of where you live,
well, sometimes you have to use your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of Wassail, a festival that predates the
Christian era, many are also spiced. Ancient pagans, celebrating
the solstice and toasting one another, would add cinnamon, nutmeg
or clove to their wine or beer.
</P>
<P>
   But spices alone do not make for a good winter or holiday brew.
The best seasonal beer you're not going to taste in Georgia _
Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale _ is simply a super India Pale Ale,
enormously hoppy (60 International Bitterness Units or more) with a
complex malty backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, though, at a smidgen more than 6 percent alcohol by
volume, it's too much for Georgia, where the 6 percent legal limit
keeps out many of the world's great beers. Among them are not only
beers fractionally higher than the limit but also barley wines,
extra-strong ales that reach 10 percent and 11 percent alcohol.
What a cognac is to the grape, a barley wine is to the grain. But
you cannot buy one in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   What you can buy are annual classics like Anchor's Our Special
Ale, a spiced brew whose recipe changes each year. Most years you
can detect spruce in it (which is why people say it's like drinking
a Christmas tree), and sometimes ginger and nutmeg. Flavoring a
beer is usually a mistake, but this singular ale _ which was not in
the market at the time this was written _ is the benchmark for
exquisite seasonals.
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest seasonal has to be _ as it is every year _ Samuel
Smith's Winter Welcome. But you can't drink the label. Against all
reason, the famous old brewery from the Yorkshire town of Tadcaster
persists in bottling its exceptional ales in clear glass, exposing
them to light and thus to oxidation. (Not to mention the fact that
an imported beer will almost never be as fresh as a domestic beer.)
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasant surprise, then, to find this year's Winter
Welcome in such good condition, the toasted malt flavors perfectly
set off by East Kent Golding and Fuggles hops. It only makes you
imagine how good it must taste in a Yorkshire pub.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Solstice Winter Ale is an excellent version of an
English Strong Ale, fuller bodied and higher in alcohol than its
tamer cousin, a brown ale. Made for Denver's Wynkoop brewpub by
Broadway Brewing Co., also in Denver, Solstice Winter Ale has a
more roasted maltiness than Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome and
slightly more hop character.
</P>
<P>
   Other seasonal beers worth trying:
</P>
<P>
   Winterhook. The annual seasonal from Redhook of Seattle,
Winterhook has been consistently rich and full-bodied, with a
porterlike character. The 1998 version is one of the best in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Goose. Back in the Atlanta market after a three-year
absence, Snow Goose, now made by Frederick Brewing Co. in
Frederick, Md., has always been a ``look for'' beer. Strong and
rich, it doesn't seem to have quite the character it had when it
was made by Wild Goose Brewery. But a good winter beer, even so.
</P>
<P>
   Snowball's Chance. An ordinary winter beer. Not at all bad, but
not exceptional either. Also made by Frederick Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Aass Juleol. Founded in 1834, Aass is Norway's oldest brewery.
The bottle and the label are more charming than the beer. A
slightly sweet aftertaste that's surprising in a dark beer.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetwater Festival Ale. The hustling Atlanta brewery made an
outstanding seasonal beer last year, and has made another this
year. Not only that, but it's $2 cheaper. Sold in numbered 1-liter
bottles priced at $8, Sweetwater Festival Ale tastes a bit like a
Scotch Ale, but with hints of spice.
</P>
<P>
   Red Brick Winter Brew. One of Atlanta Brewing Co.'s best
offerings last year, Red Brick Winter Brew returns in pretty much
the same form. Not as full-bodied as the Sweetwater, and a little
more forward with the spice.
</P>
<P>
   Dogwood Winter Ale. Brewed from barley, wheat, oats and rye.
Hearty but not as silky as one might have expected from an ale with
oats and wheat in the grist.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Grant's Winter Ale. Brewed exclusively with Mount Hood
hops, this might have been the best of Bert Grant's four seasonals
last year. This year's also uses Mount Hoods, which impart an
earthy, herbal aroma and flavor. As with all of Bert Grant's beers,
the yeast has a ``house flavor'' that can be an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   I know Santa would appreciate the Samuel Smith's, the Solstice
or the Sweetwater. But I think what he really wants is Sierra
Nevada Celebration Ale. If this keeps up, he just might stop coming
to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Adams Winter Lager. In the past, Boston Beer Co. has made
both Winter Lager and Old Fezziwig, a spiced ale with a Dickensian
motif. The latter has been dropped this year, but the flavorsome
Winter Lager has perhaps greater versatility and appeal. This is
one of the few lagers among winter beers, and it can best be
compared to a German Dunkel (dark). Like everything from Sam Adams,
it's well-made and smartly marketed.

 &HT;    BUSH WRAPS UP VISIT TO ISRAEL
 &HT;    EDs: Bush is scheduled to leave at 5 p.m. EST (1 a.m. Tel Aviv
time).
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush was wrapping up his first
visit to Israel Tuesday night, after a helicopter tour that edged
slightly into the highly-sensitive world of peace process politics.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli government official, who asked not to be identified,
said that a request of U.S. Embassy officials prompted Bush and
three other Republican governors to cancel short visits to two
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements, Jewish neighborhoods spread throughout the
largely-Arab West Bank, are a source of controversy in the peace
process. Palestinians view them as encroaching on their land, which
was captured by Israel in 1967. Many Israelis believe that the
settlements help protect the country's security.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have asked that Israel stop expanding settlements
and occasionally ask visiting dignitaries to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Jewish Coalition, a Republican Party group that
supports the settlement policies of Israel's right-wing government,
organized the three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   The group would not release schedules, but an Israeli government
schedule listed two 15-minute stops at settlements that are often
used as observation points over the West Bank. The schedule
included no meetings with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians claimed that the visits, especially because of
Bush's potential candidacy for the president, would be used by the
Israelis as a small validation of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter tour did not make the stops Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter did touch down briefly at another settlement
where Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who was leading the tour, left
the group to board another helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tuesday, the group visited an Israeli Aircraft Industries
plant, toured the area around the Sea of Galilee and, further
north, the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the focus of attention from Israeli officials but has
repeatedly declined to make anything but brief comments to the
press during the trip. He has said he would hold his remarks for a
press conference in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. The group was
expected to leave Israel on a late-night flight Tuesday.

   MEYER-LEMON (Undated) _ Many people go through life with a
single, vivid taste image of a lemon _ one of something acidic,
clean tasting and unforgivingly sharp. Unlike an orange, which has
dozens of flavors depending on the variety, the lemon has just one,
reliable note that sticks firmly in their mind. That is, until they
taste a Meyer lemon. This fruit, thought to be a cross between
either a lemon and an orange or a lemon and a mandarin, looks like
a lemon but with tight orange-yellow skin when it's ripe. And it
tastes more like a lemon with a gentle streak. Its sharpness is
softened with a beguiling sweetness and an intoxicating perfume
that's both floral and herbaceous, a little like rosemary. By
Amanda Hesser.

   WITHOUT-RECIPES (Undated) _ Nearly a decade ago, we were staying
with two other couples in a rented beach house, and the agreement
was that each of us would cook one meal. For mine, I was carrying a
photocopy of a time-tested recipe. I spent a sunny, breezy day
racing down supermarket aisles collecting ingredients. In the
kitchen, I played fast and loose with garlic and pepper, but
nothing could raise my shrimp-with-rice dish above the bland. The
next day's lunch was another couple's turn. After a lazy morning,
the wife sauntered into the kitchen saying she would make use of
leftovers. She swiftly transformed the remains from my meal,
flavoring the rice and shrimp with a little cumin from an ancient
bottle on the shelf. She, of course, got the applause that I had
suffered for. How did she do it, we asked. ``I just listen to what
the food tells me to do,'' she said. That was when I decided that I
too would learn to cook without recipes. By Polly Frost.

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR WITH AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Quick! What computer titan recently said: &QL; 
``We share . . . a vision for the future in which consumers will be
able to access (our) brands anywhere, at any time, and from any
device.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. It sure sounds like good old Bill Gates pushing Windows
again, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. It was Steve Case, the head honcho at America
Online, commenting a few days ago on huge $4.2 billion AOL
acquisition of Netscape and the pair's agreement to work with Sun
Microsystems through the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The entire quote was, ``We share with Sun a vision for the
future in which consumers will be able to access America Online
brands anywhere, at any time, and from any device.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers were quick to predict that last week's
AOL/Netscape/Sun deal would create a computing and online megabeast
capable of giving that nasty ol' Microsoft a good beating.
</P>
<P>
   Before you start cheering, though, remember that age-old
warning: ``Be careful what you wish for . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The way Case is talking, the world could just be trading a nasty
ol' Microsoft for a nasty ol' AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The Dulles, Va., online behemoth has more than 14 million
customers and one of the top three or four most-popular Web sites
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the widely used Netscape browser, Navigator,
and add in the 20 million people who regularly visit Netscape's
existing Web site, and you've got yourself one heck of a 500-pound
gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know that old joke: ``What does a 500-pound gorilla
eat for lunch? Anything he pleases!''
</P>
<P>
   If you are an AOL customer, or if you ever have been, you know
that the browser in AOL's proprietary software is kinda stinky.
Even in the last year or so, when the AOL browser was supposed to
have been a version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, it still
failed, running slowly, badly or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   How long do you think that will continue now that this merger
has surfaced? I bet software developers the world over are already
retooling their products to better serve AOL and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be long before the world starts complaining about
the power of the AOL/Netscape gorilla, much like it now does about
the domination of Microsoft and its Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   That will only leave consumers, once again, with fewer choices,
despite what Case tells interviewers on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, we ought to take some of that worry we've
assigned to the Y2K problem and redirect it toward megamergers like
this one. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Your take on Microsoft &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I tossed out a request for people to write in
with their thoughts on the government's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some of you had to say:
</P>
<P>
   From Tom: ``I just wanted to write and comment on Microsoft,
mainly on the people who say they hate Microsoft and people that
say they won't use Microsoft products. Microsoft has created an
operating system as well as compatibility with hardware and
software that makes production quicker, jobs simpler and Web access
a breeze. It has also created hundreds of thousands of jobs
creating and supporting not only their software, but many other
applications. So what if their OS has a mind of its own, so do most
automobiles and VCRs. People, quit complaining and start enjoying
your computer on behalf of the best software company in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   From Floyd: `Questions that I would love to see Department of
Justice put to Microsoft:
</P>
<P>
   1. Why does Microsoft package and sell its Word, Powerpoint &AMP;
Excel products separately and NOT the browser Explorer?
</P>
<P>
   2. Put another way: Why was it necessary to integrate Internet
Explorer with the Windows operating system and NOT Word, Powerpoint
&AMP; Excel?
</P>
<P>
   I suggest the following answer: Because Microsoft could not put
Netscape out of business if they priced and sold Explorer
separately to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   From Jim: ``I believe they're a great company, but one that has
abused its power for the want of even greater control of anything
involving software for computers and/or computer communications. In
addition, I find Microsoft very devious in that you buy a product
with seemingly no connection to them and suddenly discover that the
program is dependent on Microsoft's browser. Unbelievable. This has
personally happened to me with two programs.''
</P>
<P>
   From David: ``I agree that Microsoft should be a little less
aggressive and a little more focused on product features and
quality. However, I would add that lots of us could be less
sensitive to the `bad' things Microsoft is supposedly doing. Just
use the stuff, and be glad we don't have to put up with the way
computers used to behave just a few years ago. I think Microsoft
has been a godsend, and I like most of their products.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
News from all over &QL;

</P>
<P>
   - IBM recently unveiled what it says is the world's highest
capacity hard drive for desktop PCs. The company calls the
25-gigabyte monster the ``Deskstar 25GP.'' To put that capacity
into perspective, IBM says the drive is large enough to hold ``the
double-spaced typed text on a stack of paper more than 4,000 feet
high, more than six full-length feature films or 20,000 digital
images.'' Hmm. That would take a while to fill! No word yet on what
this baby costs.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't know where the computing world is headed? Don't feel
bad. Apparently nobody else does, either. A recent conference in
Santa Clara, Calif., made that fact painfully obvious. Such
high-tech gurus as analyst Esther Dyson and editors of the
investment magazine ``The RedHerring'' were full of opinions on the
future. And many of them were contradictory. ``Herring'' editors,
for example, said that Internet access will be close to free within
10 years. Dyson, however, said top-quality Net access will continue
to cost money.
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed so nice . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's dose of humor comes from my friend Owen in Silicon
Valley:
</P>
<P>
   One day, a highly successful Wall Street executive was hit by a
bus and died. Her soul went to heaven, where she met St. Peter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Heaven,'' St. Peter said. ``However, before you get
settled in, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough,
we've never once had an executive make it this far and we're not
really sure what to do with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem, just let me in,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going
to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven and then
you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.''
</P>
<P>
   So, St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went
down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself
stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In
the distance was a country club where everyone was dressed in
evening gowns and formal wear. They all cheered, and welcomed her
warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them played an excellent round of golf and at night they
all met at the country club where she enjoyed an exceptional
dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy and
she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such
a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave.
Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly
Gates where she found St. Peter waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,'' he said. So she
spent the next 24-hours lounging around on clouds and playing the
harp and singing. She found it very comfortable and relaxing and
before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in
heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman paused for a second and then replied, ``Well, I never
thought I'd say this, I mean, heaven has been really great and all,
but I think I had a better time in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went
down-down-down back to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened
she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in
garbage and filth. She saw that everyone was dressed in tattered
clothing and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Devil came up to her, she said, ``I don't understand.
Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club
and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all
there is a wasteland of garbage and everyone looks miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil looked at her and smiled. ``Yesterday we were
recruiting you _ today you're staff.'' &QL;

IMMIGRANTS FILE LAWSUIT OVER FEDERAL DEPORTATION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Bairon Morales-Oliva is behind bars without bail
partly because he drove while drunk and partly because he was born
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Morales-Oliva, a longtime resident of Victoria, Texas, and a
legal immigrant, has spent nearly three months in a Texas lockup
while federal officials try to deport him because of a 1993 drunken
driving conviction, a felony offense.
</P>
<P>
   He was denied bail. It didn't matter that his wife and his six
children are American citizens, and that his boss of more than 12
years trusts him with the keys to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his ties to Texas, a federal law enacted in
October requires immigration officials to lock up criminal aliens
while their deportation proceedings move through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Morales-Oliva, in a lawsuit filed Monday, contends that the law
is unconstitutional. Locking him up while denying him a chance to
prove he poses no threat of fleeing or danger to his community
violates his right to due process of the law, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Omar Rodriguez, a Mexican national fighting
deportation in a 1993 marijuana possession case, Morales-Oliva is
suing Attorney General Janet Reno, as well as Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astounding that we have a law that says we can hold
people in detention indefinitely until we can decide if we can
deport them,'' said Simon Azar-Farr, the San Antonio attorney
representing the two men.
</P>
<P>
   He is asking that the lawsuit be classified as a class action on
behalf of all immigrants being held without bail while facing
deportation in the Western District of Texas, which stretches from
Waco to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Azar-Farr wants a federal judge to halt enforcement of the
mandatory detention law, which was passed as part of the 1996
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act but did not
take effect until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates argue that some immigrants may indeed be
flight risks or pose threats. But they say the defendants are
nonetheless guaranteed a court appearance to argue their cases
before they can be locked up for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders of the law say it added teeth to otherwise weak
immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said that 90 percent of immigrants
who were deported but not detained never actually left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we don't detain those who are ordered deported, we mock
immigration laws and allow 90 percent to avoid deportation,'' he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials, already struggling to hold an increasing number
of deportable immigrants, braced for the 1996 law by adding or
contracting for more cell space. The agency added 4,000 beds in
fiscal 1997 and another 2,900 in the fiscal year that ended in
September, bringing its capacity to 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials, however, estimate the agency will need at least
17,000 cells to hold all the people targeted by the mandatory
detention law. In the agency's Dallas region, which oversees 18
states, there are some 5,700 immigrants in detention _ about twice
as many as anticipated.

MUSEUMS LOSE THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - When I was a boy, with my curiosity still wide as a
barn door, I spent a lifetime at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York. It was a second home to me _ the true home for
my hungry brain. I went there every chance I got.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, a block-square monolith of sandstone and statuary,
housed in it what seemed like the complete set of everything in the
world. There were the dinosaur skeletons, the stuffed gorillas in
their African panorama, the tusks of mastodons, a full-size model
blue whale and an entire room of quartz specimens, with small faded
typewritten labels indicating from where they were collected.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what I was currently interested in, the American
Museum had the basic stuff to answer my questions. You could learn
the bare facts from a book, but you could only experience the
reality by seeing the specimens.
</P>
<P>
   I have gone back to visit the museum many times as an adult, and
each time, the museum has seemed diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the diminishment probably comes from the
comparison of the bland present with the rich broth of nostalgia,
but I know that does not account for the whole change.
</P>
<P>
   For some of my favorite exhibits have not been altered over the
years, and they still excite me as they used to. The ``soil
profiles of New York State,'' for instance, or the stuffed Alaska
Brown Bears, or the totem poles from the Northwest Coast Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Or the small altar to nature writer John Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the museum has changed, and it is in those changes I
sense the shrinking of the magic I used to feel.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs are a good example.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms containing those fossils are undoubtedly the most
popular in the museum. And changes in paleontology have rendered
obsolete some of the old exhibits. The new model for the dinosaurs
on display is no longer the lumbering Godzilla, upright with a
dragging tail, but rather the neck-forward-tail-straight blue jay.
The bones had to be reset and redeployed to make that change.
</P>
<P>
   I'm OK with that. I want my science up to date _ even though I
know that the current dinosaurs will be out of date sometime in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But the new exhibit is like many in modern museums: short on
bones, long on graphics and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The current dinosaur rooms are bright, uncluttered and
graphically concise _ not too much stuff to take in in a single
brief visit.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the museum was a place to come back to over and
over, because you could never take it all in.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the basic mission of museums has undergone a
epochal shift, as if we have passed from some Mesozoic to some
Cenozoic vision of a museum's raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   The old museum is itself a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, museums such as the American Museum in New York, or
the Smithsonian in Washington, or the Field Museum in Chicago
served as a kind of cultural Noah's ark, preserving examples of the
world we live in.
</P>
<P>
   They served to educate us in the process, but the preservation
of the vast variety of life and nature was the museum's purpose.
Scholars could count on that quartz, so they could look at a piece
from New Jersey and compare it to a chunk from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They could learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, museums have become part of the vast entertainment
industry, meant to keep us _ and particularly our attention-deficit
children _ from being bored.
</P>
<P>
   There are buttons to press and video screens to watch (although
the clips shown are never long, not wanting to try the visitor's
patience or attention span).
</P>
<P>
   So, that quartz exhibit, which used to contain hundreds of
rocks, is reduced to a single clear, white cobble with an
explanatory wall panel, most likely with a video screen showing
lava splattering from the tip of a volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it has to wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   Museum directors increasingly see their job as educators, and as
educators, they see that job best fulfilled if they are
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if, instead of taking on two of every species, Noah
booked a trained chimp act and marketed the ark as a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   As such, I am afraid museums have become a part of the
cheapening of American intellectual life, its thinning of content
and smoothing of the difficulties of learning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious. What museums do now is present a version
of the world that is prepackaged and gift wrapped, and thus,
presents only the ``official version'' of science and history.
</P>
<P>
   When the museums showed us a raft of specimens and very little
summation, we had to create our own versions of truth. We were
active participants in the understanding of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, museumgoers are a passive audience, fed a three-sentence
version of reality that distorts the contradictory variety for the
sake of coherent simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Television can do that just as well. &QL;

A PLAYER'S PAIN PUTS FOOTBALL IN PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ken Norton said he wasn't sure how Bryant Young
fractured his right leg Monday night. He said he just remembered a
collision, and ``a scream I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of scream football players know almost
instinctively, the kind they know can erode their own will to keep
playing this dangerous game if they get too close or stay too long.
It breaks down the iron masks and stony hearts football players
must wear to maintain their demeanor, which is why Norton did not
linger long near Young, the great defensive tackle whose season had
just ended and whose career had just been dramatically changed.
</P>
<P>
   Norton knew he was involved in the injury _ he dived at New York
quarterback Kent Graham late in the fourth quarter of the San
Francisco 49ers' 31-7 win Monday and in missing Graham his helmet
snapped Young's tibia and fibula grotesquely. He may even have
known how it happened, although nothing in football happens in real
time for the players involved. He was surely among the first
players to wave frantically for the 49er doctors to come onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he was among the very few. Graham cradled Young's head
and said something meant to comfort. Defensive linemate Roy Barker
ran onto the field from the sideline (``I ran out on the field
trying to get his attention to take his mind off it,'' Barker
said). Head coach Steve Mariucci walked on and let Young squeeze
his hand ``just to give him something to grab onto.''
</P>
<P>
   The other players on both sides watched from a good 10 yards
away, alternately staring at Young and looking away
self-consciously, trying to contain their own horror with the
comforts of distance without seeming too callous _ a difficult line
to straddle by any means.
</P>
<P>
   And when Young was carted from the field, to be taken to the
hospital for surgery to repair the damage, they resumed their game,
albeit halfheartedly. Graham, whose improvised dash from the pocket
led to Young's injury, tried and failed to coax the Giants into the
end zone, the fans roared their approval at another defensive stop,
and life sort of resumed in this surreal world.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's did, too, but when he came off the field, he walked to
the far 20-yard line to be alone with his misery. Special teams
coach George Stewart walked over to try to comfort him, but the
attempt was doomed to fail, and Stewart knew it. He was telling
Norton with a hand and a whisper that he would not be left alone,
that his compatriots understood.
</P>
<P>
   Norton knew the drill, too. He has played in the NFL for 11
years, and four years at the University of California at Los
Angeles before that. He has seen other men hurt catastrophically,
like Joe Theismann. He has seriously injured three players himself
with the fury of his play _ Los Angeles Raiders running back
Napoleon McCallum in the opening game of the 1994 season, whose
knee was essentially destroyed so that he never played effectively
again, and teammate Richard Dent a week later against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Young's injury, though, was particularly gruesome, because there
is no ambiguity about a leg snapped at the mid-shin and left at a
40-degree angle. The ABC ``Monday Night Football'' crew made a
point of not showing the injury repeatedly, as it had in 1985 when
Lawrence Taylor of the Giants snapped Theismann's leg, or in 1994
with McCallum. Still, once is enough, and more than enough for
Norton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I guess I don't want to see it ever again,'' he said
forlornly. ``The way he screamed, the pain I knew he was in, that
was enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a football matter, he explained Young's loss in
easy-to-understand terms: ``Losing Bryant Young is like losing
Jerry Rice or Steve Young. He is very strong, a force on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   As a personal matter, though, he could only fall back on the
kind of deal-with-the-devil philosophy that all football players
must agree to if they are to last in a game this haphazardly
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is so strange ...'' he said, ``and we're all so
fortunate to play it ... but I don't think people realize the
chances we take to play this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He may not have known it, but he was speaking to his fellow
players, many of whom have never seen an injury of this scope up
close. They've know blown knees, hyperextended elbows, concussions
all too well, but fractures that cause a visible change in a man's
silhouette strike them all to their souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell how we handle it,'' Mariucci said, looking
ahead so that he wouldn't have to look behind. ``I'm optimistic we
will all handle it properly, as we have had to handle things like
this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there will always be those screams. No player who hears
them once ever forgets them, because they say so much that players
don't want to hear. Surely Ken Norton will never forget them. He
has been too close to them too many times ever to forget.

 &HT;    LOCATION'S THE KEY TO EFFICIENT HOLIDAY SHOPPING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If reducing Christmas bills and shopping stress are
your goals this holiday season, two of the keys are making a list
and setting a budget, consumer experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Consumers Union, the group that publishes
Consumer Reports magazine, said smart shoppers know what they want
to buy and how much they're willing to spend. To balance selection
and expense, they said, it's important to know the strengths and
weaknesses of today's galaxy of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Department stores: For shoppers who place a higher priority on
quality than price, department stores carry the newest and latest
items. Although prices tend to be higher than at discount stores,
cost comparison between department stores is often unnecessary
because most carry the same merchandise at comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for electronics mega-stores, but inventory is
often very limited. Electronics are one of the hottest sellers
during the holidays, so if you find the item you want at one of
these stores, it's best to buy it then and there.
</P>
<P>
   But beware of store credit cards that lure shoppers with special
offers such as ``no payments, no interest for six months'' unless
you intend to pay off the entire balance on time. If you don't, a
whopping finance charge may apply.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discount stores: Chain stores that offer discount prices may
be worth the bargain, but selection is limited. To get the best
deals, you have to visit often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlet malls: Those seeking the lowest of prices this season
may consider taking a trip to an outlet mall. Prices at outlet
stores can be between 5 and 50 percent lower than full price at
retail stores, and shoppers often can find a greater variety of
designer brands. But the quality of the merchandise is slightly
lower at outlet malls, so check your potential purchases very
carefully before buying.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate your ability to bargain for a better price
at outlet stores. Shoppers who point out a defect in a piece of
merchandise or mention a competitor's lower price are more likely
to get a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online shopping: If you're turned off by crowded parking lots,
cash register lines and long drives to an outlet, online shopping
may be for you. The high-tech version of catalog shopping, online
purchases can be delivered directly to your home.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a wide variety of stores to choose from online,
finding the perfect gift in the sea of merchants can be a
challenge. To cut down on time and hassle on the Web, start with a
search engine such as like Yahoo or Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping on line, make sure you know when to expect
delivery and be aware of the shipping and handling charges. There's
little risk to consumers in using a credit card on a ``secure''
Internet site, but if you're nervous, start out by buying something
small or sticking to companies you know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you choose to shop, to avoid hassles after the
holidays, be aware of each store's return policies and keep all
receipts. Many companies are very liberal in what they will take
back, but sometimes such items as software, jewelry and certain
types of clothing are non-returnable.
</P>
<P>
   One last word of advice on shopping smart is to start early.
Prices near the end of the holiday season usually aren't any lower
than they are now, and procrastinators will only get a limited
selection to choose from, making it even more difficult to find the
right gift for loved ones.

Hassle-Free Holiday'' at

and expense, they said, it's important to know the strengths and
weaknesses of today's galaxy of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Department stores: For shoppers who place a higher priority on
quality than price, department stores carry the newest and latest
items. Although prices tend to be higher than at discount stores,
cost comparison between department stores is often unnecessary
because most carry the same merchandise at comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for electronics mega-stores, but inventory is
often very limited. Electronics are one of the hottest sellers
during the holidays, so if you find the item you want at one of
these stores, it's best to buy it then and there.
</P>
<P>
   But beware of store credit cards that lure shoppers with special
offers such as ``no payments, no interest for six months'' unless
you intend to pay off the entire balance on time. If you don't, a
whopping finance charge may apply.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discount stores: Chain stores that offer discount prices may
be worth the bargain, but selection is limited. To get the best
deals, you have to visit often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlet malls: Those seeking the lowest of prices this season
may consider taking a trip to an outlet mall. Prices at outlet
stores can be between 5 and 50 percent lower than full price at
retail stores, and shoppers often can find a greater variety of
designer brands. But the quality of the merchandise is slightly
lower at outlet malls, so check your potential purchases very
carefully before buying.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate your ability to bargain for a better price
at outlet stores. Shoppers who point out a defect in a piece of
merchandise or mention a competitor's lower price are more likely
to get a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online shopping: If you're turned off by crowded parking lots,
cash register lines and long drives to an outlet, online shopping
may be for you. The high-tech version of catalog shopping, online
purchases can be delivered directly to your home.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a wide variety of stores to choose from online,
finding the perfect gift in the sea of merchants can be a
challenge. To cut down on time and hassle on the Web, start with a
search engine such as like Yahoo or Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping on line, make sure you know when to expect
delivery and be aware of the shipping and handling charges. There's
little risk to consumers in using a credit card on a ``secure''
Internet site, but if you're nervous, start out by buying something
small or sticking to companies you know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you choose to shop, to avoid hassles after the
holidays, be aware of each store's return policies and keep all
receipts. Many companies are very liberal in what they will take
back, but sometimes such items as software, jewelry and certain
types of clothing are non-returnable.
</P>
<P>
   One last word of advice on shopping smart is to start early.
Prices near the end of the holiday season usually aren't any lower
than they are now, and procrastinators will only get a limited
selection to choose from, making it even more difficult to find the
right gift for loved ones.
</P>

Hassle-Free Holiday'' at

   The New York Times plans a 4-page package of stories on the
Exxon-Mobil merger.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-MOBIL (Undated) _ Ledeall: Exxon buys Mobil for $77.4
billion in stock, the biggest takeover ever. The companies say they
plan $2.8 billion in annual cost reductions but give no details
about layoffs; analysts expect that more than 10,000 jobs will be
cut. The combined company will have 22 percent of the nation's
gasoline market and will refine more oil than any other company in
the world. It will rank at the top of the Fortune 500. The merger
reunites the biggest pieces of John D. Rockfeller's Standard Oil
monopoly. Exxon's chief executive, Lee Raymond, will be chairman
and chief executive of the new company, and Mobil's chief
executive, Lucio Noto, will be vice chairman. By Allen R. Myerson
and Agis Salpukas.

clash: Uniting a collection of terse engineers and loquacious
energy ambassadors won't be easy. By Agis Salpukas.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Having already been the target in
two of the biggest antitrust cases in history _ the 1911 breakup
and the oil cartel cases of the 1950s and 1960s _ Exxon and Mobil
now face a three-dimensional legal fight: against state attorneys
general, federal regulators and the European Commission. By Stephen
Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-CONSUMERS (Undated) _ Unlikely as it may seem, the merger
of the nation's two biggest oil companies is likely to benefit
consumers more than harm them, consumer groups and other industry
watchers say. By Robert D. Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   EXXON-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ Nowhere will the merged company have a
vaster reach than in Asia, where the two own and operate oil
fields, refineries, pipelines, and gas stations from the arctic
chill of Sakhalin Island, Siberia to the tropical swelter of Natuna
Island, Indonesia. By Mark Landler.

<P>
   You have just sent out the invitations for your holiday party.
You have invited tons of people for drinks and hors d'oeuvres. But
you own a total of eight glasses and no punch bowl. And if you want
to make that spiked cider, you'll need to use all your pots, and do
it in batches.
</P>
<P>
   There, of course, is the rub when it comes to holiday parties.
You want it to be big, festive, too grand for paper cups. But few
people _ especially those who live in New York apartments _ have
the equipment to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious cooks plot it out weeks in advance, scurrying all over
town to borrow things from friends. By the time the party is over,
they have reduced their life span by several years. The smart ones,
on the other hand, will rent.
</P>
<P>
   There are warehouses in New York City filled with plates,
portable stoves, blenders, even pig spits, waiting to be rented.
</P>
<P>
   At BROADWAY FAMOUS PARTY RENTALS, in Brooklyn, plates, of
course, are the item most in demand. ``Everyone does it because you
don't have to clean anything,'' Gail Hillyer, a saleswoman, said.
``You just scrape the food off and put the plates back into the
container.'' The company cleans them. Linens and chairs come next.
You can also rent glassware, and not just wine glasses. They have
everything from shot glasses ($.55 a glass per day) to lead crystal
stemware ($1.25).
</P>
<P>
   But the company also rents equipment most people would never
want to buy, like a 50-cup coffee urn ($53), ice tubs ($5.50), a
large refrigerator ($250), a small convection oven ($50) and a
20-quart stockpot ($15).
</P>
<P>
   Though once you go the rental route, orders add up quickly:
Broadway's minimum holiday order is an unusually high $500 and
delivery fees are $18, regardless of the size of the order. So, if
you're going to do it up with this company, you will have to do it
up in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Famous Party Rentals is at 134 Morgan Avenue in the
East Williamsburg section, (718) 821-4000 or (212) 269-2666.
Appointments to tour the warehouse may be made, or orders may be
placed over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   SERVICE PARTY RENTALS , 770 Lexington Avenue (60th Street),
(212) 752-7661, rents a similar slew of equipment, from ramekins
($1.35) _ in case you dare do souffles for 20 _ to triple-tier
plate stands ($15) to 18-by-27-inch sheet pans ($2.50). The minimum
order is $250, and the delivery fee is $25 during the week for
orders under $500. Orders are by appointment only.
</P>
<P>
   KUTTNER PROP RENTALS, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 242-7969,
offers a large and precious array of antique kitchenware and
tableware. If you're planning on making a Babette's feast, you can
rent antique copper pots, a cast-iron cauldron, 19th-century wooden
spoons, serving platters and mortar and pestle. They're guaranteed
conversation pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Fees, which vary from item to item, are weekly, and there is no
minimum order. Because most items are antique, there is a high
deposit.
</P>
<P>
   THE PROP COMPANY KAPLAN &AMP; ASSOCIATES also rents decorative
kitchenware and their collection is more eclectic. They have
burled-wood cutting boards, copper pots, enamelware, pitchers and
country pine tables. Prices vary depending on the item and rental
is by appointment only, (212) 691-7767.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the realm of the esoteric is IDEAL CHEESE, 1205 Second
Avenue (63rd Street), (212) 688-7579, a cheese shop on the Upper
East Side. They rent fondue pots or grills for making Swiss
raclette, in case you want to add a spin to your party. Rates are
$10 a day, and $15 for a weekend, with the purchase of the
appropriate cheese, of course.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not want to deal with the stress of it all,
there is THE MAIN EVENT, a party agency. ``We fill a very unique
void in this world,'' Daniel Vater, an owner of the company, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do anything you need really. If you need rentals we can
arrange it, or waitstaff, transportation, clowns, jugglers.'' Think
of them as a contractor _ and they don't charge a fee to the
client. The Main Event is at 167 Madison Avenue (33d Street), (212)
213-9295. Orders may be made by phone or by appointment.

FORMULA FOR BABY'S HEALTH: GOOD `GERMS' (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention bacteria, and most parents think germs, infection and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in pediatric nutrition say live bacteria may soon be
added to infant formulas to help babies digest lactose, the sugar
commonly found in milk, and to prevent and treat diarrhea, to
improve carbohydrate digestion and to control intestinal
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Probiotics, or ``good bacteria,'' have also exhibited
anti-cancer, anti-allergy and cholesterol-lowering properties, says
Dr. Jose Saavedra, director of the Pediatric Nutrition Center at
the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already, in several parts of the world, including
Europe and Asia, formulas that are nutritionally adequate for
infants and children which do contain probiotics (good bacteria),''
Saavedra says. ``How much bacteria and which bacteria to put in the
formula is still open to question.''
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra has studied hospitalized children and healthy children
4 months to 18 months old who received supplemental live bacteria
in their formula, and she says the bacteria appear to regulate
bowels as well as relieve diarrhea and diaper rash. All the
children were receiving more than 10 million _ and close to 1
billion _ bacteria as a dose once or twice a day, with no adverse
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``probiotics'' _ bacteria that can be given orally to
an animal host to improve its intestinal health _ was not coined
until the 1960s, but the use of good bacteria to preserve fermented
foods such as yogurt and cheese has been around for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra served this month as course director for the Johns
Hopkins Advances in Pediatric Nutrition symposium, attended by more
than 200 health-care professionals concerned with the nutritional
care of infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of papers presented at the symposium were discussed
in a telephone media briefing, in which experts noted that breast
milk is the ideal, most nutritionally complete food for baby during
the first year of life. It contains the perfect balance of
nutrients and other important ingredients, evolves to meet a baby's
changing nutritional needs, protects baby from disease and fosters
an intimate mother-child bond, researchers agree.
</P>
<P>
   The best alternative or supplement to breast milk, say the
experts, is an iron-fortified formula that provides the recommended
percentages of vitamins, minerals, protein, fat and carbohydrates
necessary for healthy growth and development. Infant formulas
marketed in this country must meet nutritional requirements from
the Food and Drug Administration and are almost universally safe,
says Dr. Alan Lake, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns
Hopkins and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
committee on nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the studies being done with probiotic additives
to formulas, researchers are working on ways to customize and
enhance formulas with a host of functional additives, including
fiber, rice starch (to prevent spitting up) and nucleotides to
enhance the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our desire to maximize breast feeding, many of the formulas
are attempting to take advantage of some of the contents of breast
milk, even if supplements are begun,'' Lake says. ``The use of
bacteria or the use of other materials in breast milk that promote
bacterial growth within the intestine will all be addressed with
formulas over the course of the next year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on how much of each nutrient is recommended has
switched over the years from a focus on providing the minimum
required to prevent deterioration and acute disease, to the concept
of consuming much larger amounts in order to optimize health and
suppress the development of chronic diseases, many of which begin
in childhood, notes Dr. Ben Caballero, director of the human
nutrition at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   RDAs, or recommended daily allowances _ first created in 1941 by
the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Science _
are revised about every 10 years and are currently under
examination. The last revision was in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   For children, the revisions are based primarily on observational
data from children who are considered to be in good health and
growing at the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   For infants during the first year of life, breast milk intake is
the reference standard, and recommendations are developed by
analyzing the content of nutrients in breast milk and estimating
the volume of breast milk that healthy infants consume.

RR FANS HIT A MAJOR CROSSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Almost all of us had played with toy trains
when we were kids. The difference between me and the rest of the
crowd inside a giant white tent at Scottsdale Embassy Suites was
that at some point I stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I wasn't bidding in the auction portion of the
Desert Division of the Train Collectors Association's Turkey Meet
on Sunday afternoon. No offers from me on what could have passed
for the contents of the world's largest attic _ table after table
of toy engines, boxcars, tiny water towers, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I was watching the bidders, looking for whatever spark
ignites inside these men, turning a hobby into a full-bore
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   A swap meet was held the day before, but Sunday's auction was
where the real model railroaders held forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the collectors,'' Fred Hunter, the president of the
Desert Division, said as he eyed a 736 Berkshire engine he had
wanted since he was a child. ``These are the ones who are serious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy trains are interesting enough, but serious collectors are
fascinating. It's one thing to mount a license-plate frame that
says ``I'd rather be running my Lionel trains'' on your Ford F-150,
as someone in the parking lot had done. It's another to set up one
of the largest model-railroad layouts in the state in your home,
one so large it can run 11 trains at once.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of Tom Stange, collector extraordinaire. &QL; 
Rail addition &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the trains for their historical value,'' Stange
said. ``Not to say I don't like to see them run and operate. I do.
But I get as much pleasure seeing them on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Stange considers himself ``not necessarily obsessed,'' though he
allowed as to how some people might think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have added on to the house'' to make room for trains, he
said. ``The room is over 1,000 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I can see how people might use the O-word.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Gibbs doesn't consider himself obsessed, either. Oh, sure,
he does have the three layouts at home in a large train room.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I don't bring them into the house _ into the living
quarters _ I'm OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So why does he collect trains?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why stamps?'' he answered. ``By the way, I do have stamps and
coins, too. My wife says it's a gene you inherit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like she's onto something.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better word would be (begin ital) intense (end ital),'' he
said. ``Some people are more intense than others.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Matter of perspective &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in this crowd there would be no out-and-out confession
to obsession. But then I realized the problem. If you were in the
middle of a room full of midgets, it wouldn't do you much good to
ask which one was the short guy. In some ways, Gibbs was right _
it's all a matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jerry Morris wasn't obsessed with model railroading,
either, even though he and his friend, George Farkis (who wore a
striped engineer's hat while he thumbed through a well-worn
paperback guide to Lionel trains), drove from El Paso for the
auction. Just intense.
</P>
<P>
   Morris tried to explain the attraction of the trains, of what
might lead to an obsession _ not that he had one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I grew up, most travel was by train,'' he said, ``and I
lived near a railroad depot. Definitely, if you have a little
wanderlust, it imprints on you.''
</P>
<P>
   That imprint may fade, he said, but it doesn't disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put (the trains) away when you're 15 and you pull them
back out when you're 25, and you realize you missed out on 10
Christmases,'' he said. ``You find out you missed 10 different
engines when you were out of it. You've got to play catch-up
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So he has, and then some _ he's 60 now. Maybe he could argue
that for him model railroading is still a hobby, not yet an
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   But for my money, that train's already left the station. &QL;

   Sutter Home Moscato 1996, California. About $5.
</P>
<P>
   No that's not a misprint; the price of this wine is $5 _ and
that's the suggested price. You could probably find it somewhere
for even less, but why bother? It's a remarkable bargain at $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinchero family, who own Sutter Home, have been making this
remarkable little dessert wine for almost half a century. I first
discovered it at a tasting a few months ago and wondered where it
had been all my life. It has, to me, a citrus bouquet and a
delightful blend of peach and apricot flavors. Most important, it
has the acid it needs to balance the sweetness, so it isn't flabby
or sugary.
</P>
<P>
   If you are seeking a Sauternes-like subtlety, look elsewhere. If
the idea of a delightful, uncomplicated aperitif at a delightful,
uncomplicated price appeals to you, here is the wine.

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

LIGHT SOY SAUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've got a recipe calling for light soy sauce. What is this,
and how does it differ from regular soy sauce? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Soy sauce, that ubiquitous Asian condiment and cooking
ingredient, comes in many more shades than are commonly available
on supermarket shelves. Generally speaking, there are three broad
classes: light, medium and dark.
</P>
<P>
   Light soy sauce (not to be confused with reduced-sodium soy
sauce), which is amber in hue, is comparatively pale in color and
has a thin consistency and subtle flavor. Medium soy sauce _ the
standard kind found in markets and on the tables of most Chinese
restaurants _ has a deep brown color and a more intense taste. Dark
soy sauce, also called heavy soy sauce or tamari, which is the
Japanese version, is thicker and more potent than the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes that call for light soy sauce usually have a delicate
color or flavor, either of which could be slightly sullied by
regular soy sauce. But the difference is extremely nuanced, and
regular soy sauce, if you can't get to an Asian market to buy the
light kind, will yield a perfectly adequate dish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to reduce the amount of yeast in a bread
recipe and substitute a portion of baking powder? My grandson must
reduce the amount of yeast he eats, and I'm trying to make a bread
for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   A: Substituting is not possible, even for a portion (yeast and
baking powder have different chemical actions) _ but the good news
is that you can simply reduce the amount of yeast called for in
many bread recipes without having to replace it with anything.
</P>
<P>
   But, by using less yeast, you can still achieve a relatively
light loaf by letting fewer yeast cells work harder. That is, by
allowing the dough to rise for twice (or even four times) as long,
in most cases, you can use much less yeast.
</P>
<P>
   As a general guide, try cutting the amount of yeast called for
in a recipe in half and then allow three to six hours for the first
rise. (When the dough doubles in bulk, it's ready for shaping and a
second rise.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have time to start the bread the day before, you can even
cut the yeast by up to three-quarters and let the dough rise in the
refrigerator overnight. As a bonus, the bread will taste better,
since a longer rise allows more flavor to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, breads made with a high protein white wheat flour, such
as regular supermarket bread flour, will bake up into lighter
loaves than heavier doughs made with whole grain flours.

   They came in within days of each other. Each patient was young,
well dressed and employed. The malady they shared was simple, in a
sense, but not straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving
that morning, his right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't
speak. Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods, can you understand me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Yuh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeeze my hands.'' His right hand gripped my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I said. ``Does it feel stronger than it did a
little while ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he strained to speak. ``Yuh.'' Then he shook his head,
sad and disgusted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods,'' I continued, ``I need to ask you some questions.
Have you ever used cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for a 44-year-old to have a stroke, but with no
history of hypertension or smoking, it's decidedly unusual. Unless
cocaine is involved. Mr. Woods's head trembled a bit, then he
looked me in the eye. ``Uh, hm,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time?'' I asked. ``Th-this m-morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wife walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning?'' she cried. ``John ... you said you were
clean!''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to me. ``He did the program and said he was clean.
For six months.'' She spun back to face him. ``Oh, God, you
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woods felt duped, but she is by no means alone. Doctors,
especially we emergency room doctors, pride ourselves on squeezing
the truth out of rocks. But I work in New York City; it's boom time
here, and drugs chase money.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine was such an emblem of the go-go '80s that in 1985 the
United States reported 5.7 million users. In the dozen years since,
that number has dropped by more than two-thirds, but ominous signs
of a comeback are in the wind. In 1996 we ``imported'' 240 tons of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room cares for half a dozen young professionals a
day who rush in with all the symptoms of a panic attack. But
cocaine can trigger an identical sense of choking doom. We always
ask, and they always deny. And then I meet a Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, it looked as if his stroke would be transient,
as happens when the body's own system dissolves the clot in a brain
artery before permanent damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a stocky 40-year-old woman, outfitted in the
latest take-no-prisoners Wall Street fashion, came howling into the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The medics filled us in on what had happened. ``She's at her
office. Suddenly clutches her chest and keels over. She has no
heart problems, and as far as they know, doesn't smoke, drink, or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sims was out of control. It took six ER staff members to
undress her, start an iv and run an electrocardiogram, a recording
of the heart's electrical activity. A heart attack in a woman her
age _ with no other risk factors _ would be very unusual. Her ECG
wasn't giving us a clear answer, and there are many conditions that
can cause severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   My partner that day, Susan Woo, parked herself at the bedside
and shouted above the din, ``Ms. Sims, do you use cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' her patient shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important. You may be having a heart attack. To
treat you properly, we must know anything that might put you at
risk. Have you used cocaine recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I told you. No! Oh, God, the pain. Make it stop. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan ordered high doses of nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm treating her as if it's real,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``Beats me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should a healthy, young, nonsmoking woman have a heart
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, as everyone knows, is a stimulant. It achieves its
euphoric effects by prolonging chemical interactions in the tiny
gaps between nerves, or neurons, in the brain. The drug is
especially seductive because it heightens the response of the same
neurons that allow us to experience sensual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But while cocaine is best known for its mental effects, the
blood vessels take the hardest beating. Fill your system with
cocaine and you might as well drip acid in your arteries. Susan
found me a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ms. Sims?'' she smiled ruefully. ``She ruled in for a
heart attack. It was real. And her drug screen was positive for _
guess what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Megan. Blond, plump and 22, she looked like a
rosy-cheeked poster girl for the Dutch Dairy Farmers' Guild. She
sat on a chair, eyes darting about and chest heaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan Sutherland?'' I asked, reading off the chart. ``What's
the matter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I-can't-breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chest pain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's squeezing, like a tight _ Oh, Jesus, I can't breathe _
band around my ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick exam, my concern grew. She was on the pill and had
recently had an abortion _ two predisposing factors for a pulmonary
embolus, a blood clot to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're sure,'' I repeated for the fifth time, ``no
drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana. Over a year ago. Am I going to be OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I soothed. ``But I need to take blood from your
wrist artery and see how well your lungs are getting air.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan's blood gas, the measure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in
arterial blood, was borderline normal, as was her chest X-ray.
Still, not all pulmonary emboli show up on these tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen.'' All kidding and sympathy drained from my voice.
``I'm about to send you for some very expensive, invasive, and
possibly dangerous tests. Please tell me if you use cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan eyed the distance between us. ``A couple of lines. This
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' I pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couple more after I got to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then your heart started racing? And your chest got
tight?''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your symptoms are due to the cocaine,'' I said. ``They'll wear
off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about my insurance? I just started this job. What if
they find out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is confidential. But you've got to promise me
one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she sighed, expecting the usual ``just say no''
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever, ever lie to a doctor again.''

<P>
   They came in within days of each other. Each patient was young,
well dressed and employed. The malady they shared was simple, in a
sense, but not straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving
that morning, his right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't
speak. Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods, can you understand me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Yuh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeeze my hands.'' His right hand gripped my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I said. ``Does it feel stronger than it did a
little while ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he strained to speak. ``Yuh.'' Then he shook his head,
sad and disgusted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods,'' I continued, ``I need to ask you some questions.
Have you ever used cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for a 44-year-old to have a stroke, but with no
history of hypertension or smoking, it's decidedly unusual. Unless
cocaine is involved. Mr. Woods's head trembled a bit, then he
looked me in the eye. ``Uh, hm,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time?'' I asked. ``Th-this m-morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wife walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning?'' she cried. ``John ... you said you were
clean!''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to me. ``He did the program and said he was clean.
For six months.'' She spun back to face him. ``Oh, God, you
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woods felt duped, but she is by no means alone. Doctors,
especially we emergency room doctors, pride ourselves on squeezing
the truth out of rocks. But I work in New York City; it's boom time
here, and drugs chase money.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine was such an emblem of the go-go '80s that in 1985 the
United States reported 5.7 million users. In the dozen years since,
that number has dropped by more than two-thirds, but ominous signs
of a comeback are in the wind. In 1996 we ``imported'' 240 tons of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room cares for half a dozen young professionals a
day who rush in with all the symptoms of a panic attack. But
cocaine can trigger an identical sense of choking doom. We always
ask, and they always deny. And then I meet a Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, it looked as if his stroke would be transient,
as happens when the body's own system dissolves the clot in a brain
artery before permanent damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a stocky 40-year-old woman, outfitted in the
latest take-no-prisoners Wall Street fashion, came howling into the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The medics filled us in on what had happened. ``She's at her
office. Suddenly clutches her chest and keels over. She has no
heart problems, and as far as they know, doesn't smoke, drink, or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sims was out of control. It took six ER staff members to
undress her, start an iv and run an electrocardiogram, a recording
of the heart's electrical activity. A heart attack in a woman her
age _ with no other risk factors _ would be very unusual. Her ECG
wasn't giving us a clear answer, and there are many conditions that
can cause severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   My partner that day, Susan Woo, parked herself at the bedside
and shouted above the din, ``Ms. Sims, do you use cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' her patient shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important. You may be having a heart attack. To
treat you properly, we must know anything that might put you at
risk. Have you used cocaine recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I told you. No! Oh, God, the pain. Make it stop. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan ordered high doses of nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm treating her as if it's real,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``Beats me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should a healthy, young, nonsmoking woman have a heart
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, as everyone knows, is a stimulant. It achieves its
euphoric effects by prolonging chemical interactions in the tiny
gaps between nerves, or neurons, in the brain. The drug is
especially seductive because it heightens the response of the same
neurons that allow us to experience sensual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But while cocaine is best known for its mental effects, the
blood vessels take the hardest beating. Fill your system with
cocaine and you might as well drip acid in your arteries. Susan
found me a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ms. Sims?'' she smiled ruefully. ``She ruled in for a
heart attack. It was real. And her drug screen was positive for _
guess what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Megan. Blond, plump and 22, she looked like a

<P>
   ``On or about April 6, 1995, the defendant James Taftsiou
purchased a Tektronix Model Phaser 540,'' says the District of New
Jersey federal grand jury indictment. This top-quality laser
printer cost him $9,000. Taftsiou also paid $6,000 for a computer
and $600 for a paper cutter. In October he bought a second paper
cutter because, he said, he'd worn out the blade on the first one.
By then he was a self-made millionaire. He was also being watched
by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   The chase began on Memorial Day weekend, when a prostitute
walked into the Atlantic City police station complaining that a man
at a local Quality Inn had paid her with phony $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Secret Service agents raided the hotel and arrested
seven limousine-riding high rollers who had arrived from New York
City. They also confiscated more than $20,000 in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Agents traced the source to Bardul Taftsiou, James' father, who
lived in Brooklyn. They began watching his house in October. On
November 18, agents followed five family members to Atlantic City.
Inside the Tropworld Casino, the Taftsious inserted fake $50 bills
into slot machines, played a few times, cashed out, and exchanged
the tokens for genuine money. Agents let the family play for more
than an hour, then arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Taftsious printed and passed an estimated $1.2
million in counterfeit bills. Their case was the largest in
Atlantic City's history to date. It also raised eyebrows over the
method used to manufacture such quantities of money. Desktop
digital printing had already shown up on the counterfeiting
horizon, but it was not yet the medium of choice for large
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, officials worried mainly about photocopiers.
Tom Ferguson, acting director for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the agency that makes U.S. currency, remembers how
``everybody in this business, in the late '70s and '80s, was seeing
huge color-copying machines. Currency people were saying, `Uh-oh,
how can we defeat them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Copiers became smaller and more widely available. And sure
enough, in 1993 the National Academy of Sciences put out a
disturbing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total value of counterfeits produced by color copiers and
printers ... has been doubling every year,'' it said. In 1990
counterfeiters produced $1 million in fake banknotes on ``office
machines''-copiers, laser printers, and ink-jet systems. ``In 1991
this doubled to $2 million, and in 1992 the amount increased to
between $6 million and $8 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of growth marks the early stages of disease
epidemics. Projecting it into the future, the report concluded that
office-machine counterfeits might cause ``severe problems for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off this threat, the Treasury Department approved the
first noticeable changes to U.S. currency in 70 years. In this
``next-generation'' design, new features that are difficult to
reproduce, such as bigger portraits and watermarks in the paper,
will appear on all large notes. The redesigned $100 bill came out
in 1996 and the $50 in 1997, but consumers don't see many of those.
The greatest shock to eyes numbed by the familiar greenback is just
arriving now, with the new $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the new look, wait a few years. Currency
experts are already thinking about the next next-generation design,
which Ferguson expects will be needed in seven to ten years.
``There's now a need for rapid change,'' he says. If you were just
starting a career in currency manufacture, ``you couldn't pick a
more exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason his business has become so lively is that more and
more ordinary citizens now have an opportunity to share the thrill
of printing money. So far this year, according to the Secret
Service, the amount of counterfeit currency successfully passed
into domestic circulation has jumped 25 percent over last year's
rate. If the trend continues, $40 million in bogus bills will be
culled from the money supply, versus $32 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fake note that anyone reports, anywhere in the
world, eventually makes its way to the Secret Service-charged since
its formation in 1865 with protecting the integrity of U.S.
currency. At Secret Service headquarters, a block from the White
House, Dennis Lynch, special agent in charge of the Counterfeit
Division, coolly interprets the 25 percent jump in counterfeits
being passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting has not been, and is not now, a significant
economic problem,'' Lynch insists. Look at it this way: the 32
million counterfeit dollars pulled out of circulation last year, if
printed in twenties, would be 1.6 million notes, or an average of
4,400 per day. Meanwhile, during an average day the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing churns out 38 million legal-tender Federal
Reserve notes. Stacked straight up, they would stand 2.6 miles
high. Counterfeiters chimed in with 19 more inches. That's
practically nothing. This year they've raised their daily share a
few more inches-a mere blip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looked at more closely, the recent rise in counterfeiting
seems ominous. That's because it represents not more of the same
but a new technology coming into play. While other office-machine
methods hold fairly steady, the rate of ink-jet counterfeiting
skyrockets. Of counterfeit notes that entered domestic circulation,
the ink-jet proportion rose from 0.5 percent in 1995 to 3 percent
in 1996 to 19 percent in 1997, and so far this year it's running 44
percent. From that perspective, the blip looks explosive.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an ink-jet printer and you can't believe it's capable
of imitating the currency you have in your wallet, your printer is
outdated. For a few hundred dollars these days, you can buy a good
color ink-jet printer that does ``nice work,'' as Ferguson admits.
``Not perfect by any means, but certainly deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   For most purposes, ``deceptive'' is good enough. Lynch guesses
that 98 percent of all phony bills that get passed fail to
reproduce key security features-no watermark, no security thread,
no color-shifting ink in the lower right corner. Usually the
counterfeiters don't even try. And such uncraftsmanlike
nonchalance, he says, highlights the most important reason these
bills get passed: ``The American public is not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts a heavy burden on police to take up the slack. In the
good old days Secret Service agents could handle the challenge,
because counterfeiters belonged to an identifiable breed. They
spent many hours making plates, ran off huge numbers of fake
hundreds, fifties, or twenties to cover their considerable time and
expense, and then had to pass all those bills without raising
suspicions. Inevitably they left a trail-purchasing or gaining
inside access to specialized equipment; recruiting others to help
pass the bills; or selling trunkloads of bogus cash at a discount
to criminals. The Secret Service could catch those guys with
standard gumshoe work.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, desktop counterfeiters don't need a bill-passing
network. Instead they print cash as needed. And they certainly
don't need specialized equipment. As Lynch knows all too well, at
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. ``The nightmare,'' he says, ``is
when the system changes from 500 counterfeit printers passing
$100,000 each to 100,000 passing $500 each. We can't be everywhere.
We can't be in everybody's basement and den.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is happening now. In 1995 there weren't many
$9,000 Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color
ink-jet printers can be bought for under $100. What's more, there
are stand-alone scanners that don't need a computer; they plug
right into an ink-jet or laser printer. Hook them together, and you
have a color copier-all for as little as $200, compared with
$40,000 in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the digital revolution, why shouldn't
policing go digital, too? Indeed, several manufacturers of color
copiers have installed chips that recognize the world's major
currency notes and block attempts to copy them. Unfortunately, such
a chip might raise costs. Another suggestion is to modify printers
to add a unique, covert mark to every piece of paper, allowing
counterfeits to be traced to particular machines. The Secret
Service is looking into all these possibilities and more. ``The
technical issue,'' Lynch says, ``is really the linchpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is also eyeing new
technical fixes. Many promising countermeasures have already been
adopted in other countries. Australia, for example, is spearheading
a push to plastic money. Printing on plastic allows designers to
add translucent effects to foil counterfeiting. And plastic would
make a suitable base for holograms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. currency experts are following those experiments with keen
interest. ``There are advantages but also disadvantages in security
with plastics,'' Ferguson says. ``We're years away from making that
decision.'' Tests show that the bureau's huge, high-speed intaglio
presses can print money on plastic stock. But then, so can ink-jet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Over its long history, counterfeiting has
continually leapfrogged preventive measures, behaving like certain
diseases-like the flu, say. Yet all epidemics eventually run their
course. New variants spread explosively at first, but finally new
defenses kick in and the rate of infection levels off.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the idea is to deter the new breed of counterfeiters
with enough technical barriers and currency changes to restore
equilibrium. Yet the printing techniques used for both
counterfeiting and genuine currency are mutating faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson says, ``It's a very interesting period.''

at a local Quality Inn had paid her with phony $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Secret Service agents raided the hotel and arrested
seven limousine-riding high rollers who had arrived from New York
City. They also confiscated more than $20,000 in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Agents traced the source to Bardul Taftsiou, James' father, who
lived in Brooklyn. They began watching his house in October. On
November 18, agents followed five family members to Atlantic City.
Inside the Tropworld Casino, the Taftsious inserted fake $50 bills
into slot machines, played a few times, cashed out, and exchanged
the tokens for genuine money. Agents let the family play for more
than an hour, then arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Taftsious printed and passed an estimated $1.2
million in counterfeit bills. Their case was the largest in
Atlantic City's history to date. It also raised eyebrows over the
method used to manufacture such quantities of money. Desktop
digital printing had already shown up on the counterfeiting
horizon, but it was not yet the medium of choice for large
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, officials worried mainly about photocopiers.
Tom Ferguson, acting director for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the agency that makes U.S. currency, remembers how
``everybody in this business, in the late '70s and '80s, was seeing
huge color-copying machines. Currency people were saying, `Uh-oh,
how can we defeat them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Copiers became smaller and more widely available. And sure
enough, in 1993 the National Academy of Sciences put out a
disturbing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total value of counterfeits produced by color copiers and
printers ... has been doubling every year,'' it said. In 1990
counterfeiters produced $1 million in fake banknotes on ``office
machines''-copiers, laser printers, and ink-jet systems. ``In 1991
this doubled to $2 million, and in 1992 the amount increased to
between $6 million and $8 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of growth marks the early stages of disease
epidemics. Projecting it into the future, the report concluded that
office-machine counterfeits might cause ``severe problems for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off this threat, the Treasury Department approved the
first noticeable changes to U.S. currency in 70 years. In this
``next-generation'' design, new features that are difficult to
reproduce, such as bigger portraits and watermarks in the paper,
will appear on all large notes. The redesigned $100 bill came out
in 1996 and the $50 in 1997, but consumers don't see many of those.
The greatest shock to eyes numbed by the familiar greenback is just
arriving now, with the new $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the new look, wait a few years. Currency
experts are already thinking about the next next-generation design,
which Ferguson expects will be needed in seven to ten years.
``There's now a need for rapid change,'' he says. If you were just
starting a career in currency manufacture, ``you couldn't pick a
more exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason his business has become so lively is that more and
more ordinary citizens now have an opportunity to share the thrill
of printing money. So far this year, according to the Secret
Service, the amount of counterfeit currency successfully passed
into domestic circulation has jumped 25 percent over last year's
rate. If the trend continues, $40 million in bogus bills will be
culled from the money supply, versus $32 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fake note that anyone reports, anywhere in the
world, eventually makes its way to the Secret Service-charged since
its formation in 1865 with protecting the integrity of U.S.
currency. At Secret Service headquarters, a block from the White
House, Dennis Lynch, special agent in charge of the Counterfeit
Division, coolly interprets the 25 percent jump in counterfeits
being passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting has not been, and is not now, a significant
economic problem,'' Lynch insists. Look at it this way: the 32
million counterfeit dollars pulled out of circulation last year, if
printed in twenties, would be 1.6 million notes, or an average of
4,400 per day. Meanwhile, during an average day the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing churns out 38 million legal-tender Federal
Reserve notes. Stacked straight up, they would stand 2.6 miles
high. Counterfeiters chimed in with 19 more inches. That's
practically nothing. This year they've raised their daily share a
few more inches-a mere blip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looked at more closely, the recent rise in counterfeiting
seems ominous. That's because it represents not more of the same
but a new technology coming into play. While other office-machine
methods hold fairly steady, the rate of ink-jet counterfeiting
skyrockets. Of counterfeit notes that entered domestic circulation,
the ink-jet proportion rose from 0.5 percent in 1995 to 3 percent
in 1996 to 19 percent in 1997, and so far this year it's running 44
percent. From that perspective, the blip looks explosive.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an ink-jet printer and you can't believe it's capable
of imitating the currency you have in your wallet, your printer is
outdated. For a few hundred dollars these days, you can buy a good
color ink-jet printer that does ``nice work,'' as Ferguson admits.
``Not perfect by any means, but certainly deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   For most purposes, ``deceptive'' is good enough. Lynch guesses
that 98 percent of all phony bills that get passed fail to
reproduce key security features-no watermark, no security thread,
no color-shifting ink in the lower right corner. Usually the
counterfeiters don't even try. And such uncraftsmanlike
nonchalance, he says, highlights the most important reason these
bills get passed: ``The American public is not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts a heavy burden on police to take up the slack. In the
good old days Secret Service agents could handle the challenge,
because counterfeiters belonged to an identifiable breed. They
spent many hours making plates, ran off huge numbers of fake
hundreds, fifties, or twenties to cover their considerable time and
expense, and then had to pass all those bills without raising
suspicions. Inevitably they left a trail-purchasing or gaining
inside access to specialized equipment; recruiting others to help
pass the bills; or selling trunkloads of bogus cash at a discount
to criminals. The Secret Service could catch those guys with
standard gumshoe work.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, desktop counterfeiters don't need a bill-passing
network. Instead they print cash as needed. And they certainly
don't need specialized equipment. As Lynch knows all too well, at
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. ``The nightmare,'' he says, ``is
when the system changes from 500 counterfeit printers passing
$100,000 each to 100,000 passing $500 each. We can't be everywhere.
We can't be in everybody's basement and den.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is happening now. In 1995 there weren't many
$9,000 Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color
ink-jet printers can be bought for under $100. What's more, there
are stand-alone scanners that don't need a computer; they plug
right into an ink-jet or laser printer. Hook them together, and you
have a color copier-all for as little as $200, compared with
$40,000 in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the digital revolution, why shouldn't
policing go digital, too? Indeed, several manufacturers of color
copiers have installed chips that recognize the world's major
currency notes and block attempts to copy them. Unfortunately, such
a chip might raise costs. Another suggestion is to modify printers
to add a unique, covert mark to every piece of paper, allowing
counterfeits to be traced to particular machines. The Secret
Service is looking into all these possibilities and more. ``The
technical issue,'' Lynch says, ``is really the linchpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is also eyeing new
technical fixes. Many promising countermeasures have already been
adopted in other countries. Australia, for example, is spearheading
a push to plastic money. Printing on plastic allows designers to
add translucent effects to foil counterfeiting. And plastic would
make a suitable base for holograms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. currency experts are following those experiments with keen
interest. ``There are advantages but also disadvantages in security
with plastics,'' Ferguson says. ``We're years away from making that
decision.'' Tests show that the bureau's huge, high-speed intaglio
presses can print money on plastic stock. But then, so can ink-jet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Over its long history, counterfeiting has
continually leapfrogged preventive measures, behaving like certain
diseases-like the flu, say. Yet all epidemics eventually run their
course. New variants spread explosively at first, but finally new
defenses kick in and the rate of infection levels off.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the idea is to deter the new breed of counterfeiters
with enough technical barriers and currency changes to restore
equilibrium. Yet the printing techniques used for both
counterfeiting and genuine currency are mutating faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson says, ``It's a very interesting period.''

<P>
   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of biological evolution concern the acquisition
of useful traits. But evolution is also about losing traits.
</P>
<P>
   The long list of ancestral traits that were lost or reduced in
the course of human evolution includes tails, body hair and the
bony browridges over our eyes. Snakes lost their legs, and whales
lost most of their sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   The process is common enough to be unsurprising. But why would
any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won victories? What
evolutionary force drove their loss?
</P>
<P>
   Those turn out to be difficult questions. Darwin proposed two
alternative solutions but was unable to decide between them. One of
the explanations invokes normal wear and tear, which goes
unrepaired when a gene for a biological trait falls into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once ancestral apes were spending much of their time on the
ground, for instance, mutants with shrunken tails were at no
disadvantage, and eventually mutants whose tails were shrunk to
nothing became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The other explanation can be described as motivated wrecking for
profit. Any physiological structure occupies space in an animal's
body and costs energy to make and maintain. A mutant proto-ape that
lost its tail could have devoted the freed-up energy, protoplasm
and space to a larger brain. Hypothetically, the proto-ape got more
benefits from its newly enlarged brain than from its old lost tail.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's two competing theories would be nothing more than good
cocktail party conversation if we couldn't figure out how to test
them. To resolve this debate, we'll examine the story of a
remarkable Israeli animal that has nearly lost its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Spalax ehrenbergi resembles a muddy-colored, furry, fat sausage
about eight inches long. Once you have figured out which end is the
head (the end on which a mouth opens to show teeth that bite you),
you realize that all the rest of the head except for the mouth has
an uninterrupted covering of fur.
</P>
<P>
   But that strange appearance makes perfect sense functionally
because blind mole rats spend most of their lives in underground
tunnels, where eyes would be of even less use to them than a tail
would be to us.
</P>
<P>
   Blind mole rats are not entirely eyeless. Eyes the size of
pinheads lie concealed beneath the fur and skin of their heads.
Each eye is embedded in a thick gland; its lens is shriveled; and
it has no pupil, nor eye muscles to move or focus it. Not
surprisingly, if you flash a light at Spalax, it exhibits no
reaction whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spalax's eyes have not evolved completely out of
existence. What, if anything, is that tiny eye doing?
</P>
<P>
   Spalax exhibits photoperiodic responses _ daily and seasonal
cycles of sleep, activity, reproduction and other physiological
functions. Those responses disappear in Spalax from which the tiny
eyes have been surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently Spalax's eyes are still being used to recognize the
difference between light and dark whenever Spalax sticks its head
out of its tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   How has such drastic yet precise reduction of Spalax's eyes been
accomplished? The answer came from Israeli evolutionary biologist
Eviatar Nevo's collaborations with French scientists Howard Cooper
and Marc Herbin, who studied the microanatomy of Spalax's eyes and
brain, and his work with German scientists Reinhold Necker and Gerd
Rehkdmper, who studied brain electrophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of Spalax evolution, the original eye inherited
from sighted rodent ancestors was reconfigured very selectively.
The eye and brain structures that sighted animals use for forming
images are smaller by 90 percent to 99 percent in Spalax compared
with those of sighted rodents of the same body size.
</P>
<P>
   But the brain structure involved in controlling the
photoperiodic response is as large in Spalax as in sighted rodents.
The part of the brain cortex that in humans or sighted rats would
be devoted to vision and image formation is devoted to the body's
sense of touch in Spalax and has thereby expanded to be almost
twice as large as that of a similar-size sighted rat.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, Herbin and Nevo did some calculations to understand why
natural selection led to such a selective dismantling of the Spalax
eye. They estimated that by getting rid of most of the
image-forming part of the visual system, Spalax saves over 2
percent of its whole energy budget. This is a fantastic windfall
for Spalax: energy to convert into milk for rearing pups, into
searching for food or into tunnel construction to locate a mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason that the reduction of Spalax's
visual system produced a huge advantage: Spalax has better uses for
its brain space. Consider what other senses it needs for a life
spent in a labyrinth of unlit tunnels: an exquisite sense of touch,
a good sense of hearing and a keen sense of smell. It also has a
remarkable system of magnetic compass orientation.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple sensory modalities place a big burden on
underground rodents. Getting rid of the visual cortex and turning
its space over to the sense of touch is one way Spalax copes with
the problem of how to navigate blind without its brain becoming
even larger.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when spalax entered a dark world, its visual system
didn't just rust away. Natural selection favored mutants that
jettisoned the visual system piece by piece, depending on how
useful each part was.
</P>
<P>
   This message extracted from mole rats may resolve Darwin's
puzzle about how natural selection destroys as well as creates.
Let's take just one specific example: Why did our ancestors lose
their tails?
</P>
<P>
   The way to think of your hypothetical tails is as a
lost-opportunity cost. Ask yourself about the sacrifices that you
would have to make elsewhere in your body to free up protoplasm for
a tail. Fewer pounds of brain? Then you would revert to being a big
speechless monkey. Fewer pounds of muscle? Then you would be a
wimp, easy prey for lions. Fewer pounds of kidney? Then how do you
propose to make enough urine? No, tails are fortunately gone
forever, as far as we humans are concerned. Our ancestors didn't
use them, they did lose them, and we profited.

   Prausnitz, a chemical engineer, and Mark Allen, an electrical
engineer, both from the Georgia Institute of Technology, have
developed what they believe is a replacement, at least for some
uses, for conventional hypodermic needles: a small patch covered
with hundreds of microscopic needles that penetrate the skin
without causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   The skin's outer layer _ the stratum corneum _ is an excellent
barrier to the outside world, hence the need to poke a large needle
through it to get to the bloodstream. But Prausnitz and Allen
figured that very small needles could deliver vaccines and
medication to the tissue just below the stratum corneum. The
medications would then diffuse from the tissue into capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outer skin doesn't contain any nerve endings _ the
first extensive nerve layer is below the outermost capillaries _
the small needles wouldn't cause any pain.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz and Allen made their microneedles out of silicon, with
the same etching process used to manufacture computer chips. Their
400-needle array is a tenth of an inch on a side, and each needle
is just six-thousandths of an inch long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel something, as if you were wearing a Band-Aid,''
Prausnitz says. ``So you're aware that it's there, but it's not at
all bothersome or painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The holes left by the microneedles are much smaller than the
punctures left by conventional needles, thus lowering the risk of
infection. And since the patch is so easy to use, it could be a
boon for people, like diabetics, who have to give themselves
frequent injections.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz thinks it wouldn't be too hard to add a microprocessor
and a pump, making a watch-size device that could release drugs
over time or even monitor blood levels of various medications and
automatically keep them stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might actually make it a watch,'' Prausnitz says. ``It
would keep track of time and keep track of the amounts that were
delivered at different times.''

   The San hunter-gatherers of southern Africa establish social
networks by exchanging gifts, often glass or ostrich-eggshell
beads, strung into a necklace or sewn onto a bag or hat.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts help secure future favors, says anthropologist Stanley
Ambrose of the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. As one
San man told a researcher to whom he gave a gift, ``It's free! It's
yours! And don't you forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, such gift giving may have been established
more than 40,000 years ago. He has found ostrich-eggshell beads of
that age in Kenya, which rank among the world's oldest ornaments
and may have given early humans in Africa an edge over their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose has been working at a rock shelter called Enkapune Ya
Muto, or Twilight Cave, in Kenya's Rift Valley. There, among
thousands of stone tools, he discovered the remains of an
ostrich-eggshell bead workshop.
</P>
<P>
   He found nearly 600 shell fragments, as well as 13 complete
beads. The finished beads have a hole drilled in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, early Africans may have used beads the way
the San do now, as a social survival mechanism in a difficult
environment. Though the climate in East Africa was generally cooler
and drier 40,000 years ago than it is now, the period was also
marked by dramatic fluctuations in climate. Social ties,
established by gift giving, would have helped people in tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a drought and you have to move, the place you're
most likely not to get turned away from is the place where you have
stored obligations and relationships,'' Ambrose says. ``It's the
original social security system.''
</P>
<P>
   Support from neighbors would have helped early humans survive
while others failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave the African people an advantage over Neanderthals, who
may not have had a symbolic mechanism for social solidarity,''
Ambrose says. ``The bottom line is, in competition between species
in an unpredictable environment, the gift is mightier than the
spear.''

   While some physicists strive to understand the subatomic
building blocks of matter, Elisha Moses occasionally pursues less
grandiose mysteries. A student recently asked Moses, who teaches at
the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, the following question:
What makes a sheet of paper flutter back and forth as it falls,
while a business card tumbles end over end?
</P>
<P>
   To tackle the problem, Moses and Andrew Belmonte of Penn State
built a quarter-inch-wide aquarium and dropped thin strips of
plastic of various weights and lengths into the water to see how
they fell. The unusual thinness of the tank reduced the falling to
essentially two dimensions, making the subtle motions of the
tumbling plastic strips much easier to study.
</P>
<P>
   Using small aluminum particles in the water to illuminate the
water currents, Moses and Belmonte were able to observe tiny
vortices that curled around the edges of the strips as they fell.
These vortices provide lift to the falling sheets, much the way air
passing over an airplane wing creates lift.
</P>
<P>
   The vortices do this by slightly decreasing the water pressure
above the sheet. The higher pressure below supports the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is small, but it's enough to lightly support a broad,
flat sheet of paper or a large dried leaf. As one side of the sheet
rises above the other, a vortex begins to form at the rising edge.
This vortex soon breaks away; another vortex then forms on the
opposite end of the sheet. This shifting of vortices may contribute
to the characteristic seesaw motion of fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   With increasingly dense or shorter strips, the rising end tips
up farther and farther. Eventually the strips begin to fall end
over end.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of sharp transition exists in all sorts of periodic
motion, even walking. There's a maximum speed a person can walk. To
go any faster, you need to start running. Walking is like
fluttering, Moses notes, and running is like tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a pendulum that swings higher and higher,'' he says.
``If you have enough momentum, it will go over the top and down the
other side.''

   The volunteers in Mark Prausnitz's experiment probably didn't
believe him when he told them they wouldn't feel a thing. After
all, he was proposing to jab 400 tiny needles into their skin. But
indeed the subjects reported feeling no pain, even though they
weren't anesthetized.

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

   They came into the emergency room within days of each other.
Each patient was young, well dressed and employed. The first was a
44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving that morning, his
right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't speak.
Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 9-1-1. Three days later, a stocky
40-year-old woman, outfitted in the latest take-no-prisoners Wall
Street fashion, came howling into the emergency room. ``My chest,''
she screamed. Their malady? Cocaine addiction. ``In 1996, we
`imported' 240 tons of the stuff,'' reports Tony Dajer, who treated
the aforementioned patients. Dajer, formerly associate director of
the emergency room at New York Downtown Hospital, now lives in
Paris.

   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail. The long list of ancestral
traits that were lost or reduced in the course of human evolution
includes tails, body hair and the bony browridges over our eyes.
Snakes lost their legs, and whales lost most of their sense of
smell. Why would any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won
victories? What evolutionary force drove their loss? Jared Diamond,
a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences, reports.

   The Romanesque entrance is flanked with streaming banners at
Eli's Manhattan, 1411 Third Avenue (80th Street). It's Eli Zabar's
cathedral of food, which opened Tuesday, the latest and grandest
addition to a 10-block strip that has more than its share of big
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Though the goods for sale are pretty much the same here as at
the Vinegar Factory on East 91st Street, Eli Zabar's other huge
market, the elegant buff-colored Jerusalem stone interior, with its
arches and soaring vistas, offers a sharp contrast to the rustic
uptown store.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fresh food is on the lower level, including 280
linear feet of prepared foods, fish and meat departments, a huge
pickle barrel, an oyster bar, a rotisserie and a cheese section
where cheeses, some aged on the premises, will be cut to order.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight is the produce, which is banked against one wall
and kept cool with a new gravity system: cold air naturally
replaces warm, a nice change from the sprayers that drench the
lettuce in many supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   On the main floor are breads, pastries, sandwiches, candy,
flowers and a coffee bar and cafe. A 150-seat restaurant with an
open kitchen is planned for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Zabar said he was not concerned that he was adding a market to
an avenue already overflowing with food. ``This neighborhood is so
dense, there's room for everybody,'' he said, adding that the
prices at Eli's Manhattan will be the same as at the Vinegar
Factory. &QL;

   Restaurants and chefs have been putting their names on bottles
of extra-virgin olive oil for some time now. But not Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, the chef whose restaurant empire includes Jean
Georges and Mercer Kitchen. Instead, he has just introduced a
signature grape-seed oil, a product that he has spent four years
developing.
</P>
<P>
   Why grape-seed oil, a relatively unknown ingredient in America's
kitchens?
</P>
<P>
   French chefs like it for its high smoke point (485 degrees) and
its relatively neutral flavor, making it preferred for many saute
jobs and sauces. It is also rich in mono-unsaturated fat and is not
highly processed like canola oil or corn oil.
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten's oil, made from California wine grapes, has a
subtle hint of nuttiness and comes in a handsome one-liter tin.
It's $15.95 at Citarella, 2135 Broadway (75th Street) and 1313
Third Avenue (75th Street). The same oil, produced in San Francisco
by the California Grape Seed Co., is also available at
Williams-Sonoma for $16, but without Vongerichten's name on it. &QL;

   Michael Jordan's steakhouse and gift shop in Grand Central
Terminal sells more than autographed basketballs for $1,500: there
are also sets of four steak knives for $50. The knives may be more
useful than the basketball, now that the restaurant has started
selling its steaks. They come packed in a special insulated sueded
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Four 16-ounce boneless strip sirloins are $100, and four
12-ounce filets mignons are $84. The best buy of the lot is the
four 28-ounce double rib-eyes, at $108. These are hefty hunks of
meat, tender and flavorful, and though they come with fat and bone,
each provides two ample servings.

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could do worse than to look at the world through the camera
of Jacques Henri Lartigue.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what you see there: Lartigue's family and friends
during the first decade of this century, engaged in all manner of
play and invention. There are men flying huge box kites, and women
romping in the surf in their long dresses. Later, there are the
first flying machines _ ethereal contraptions that seemed to rise
into the air on the wishes of the men who made them.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the charm of these photographs is serendipity _
Lartigue's family was wealthy, eccentric and ingenious (several
members were inventors), and provided wonderful moments to capture.
But more important was the fact that Lartigue, who was born in
1894, was a photographic anomaly: a child prodigy. He made his
first photographs when he was only 6, learned to develop them the
following year and continued to take pictures all of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 12 years after Lartigue's death, you can buy a sumptuous
monograph on the beloved Frenchman that includes 126 duotone
photographs and an introduction by New York Times photography
critic Vicki Goldberg. ``Jacques Henri Lartigue, Photographer''
(Bulfinch, $95) is one of the best books in a Christmas crop that
covers everything from beer and baseball to the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the more interesting ways to spend your money
this season:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pulp Culture: The Art of Fiction Magazines'' by Frank M.
Robinson and Lawrence Davidson (Collectors Press, $39.95). For many
years, they were the chief source of entertainment in a country
that was starved for it. The ``pulps'' were wildly popular during
the Depression and had all but disappeared by the 1950s. This is a
collection of magazine covers that gave their audiences what they
wanted to see _ sex, violence, lurid insinuation and most of all,
drama, so thick and suggestive that it made readers forget their
troubles for a while. Look at them, and you might wish they were
still around.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bird's Eye Views: Historic Lithographs of North American
Cities'' by John W. Reps (Princeton Architectural Press, $65). In
the years following the Civil War, people hungered for images of
their communities, and their favorite way of seeing them was from
an imaginary viewpoint high in the air. Before the demand for such
views waned in the early decades of the 20th century, artists _
many were itinerants who recorded the places they saw on their
travels _ had produced images of some 2,400 cities and towns. These
views are delightful not only for the contrast they offer (C.J.
Dyer drew Phoenix and Prescott in 1885, when both were sparse), but
for the idiosyncracies of the artists who created them.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Into Thin Air'' by Jon Krakauer (Villard, $40). An
illustrated edition of Krakauer's bestseller about the disastrous
day on Mount Everest in 1996 when five climbers died after they
were caught in a snowstorm near the summit. Included are more than
250 black-and-white photographs, many taken by members of the dead
climbers' expeditions, and a new postscript by Krakauer in which he
addresses the controversy that followed original publication of his
book last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Halsman: A Retrospective'' (Bulfinch, $75). This book
coincides with an exhibit of photographs that will open at the
Center for Creative Photography in Tucson next March. It includes
Halsman's famous portraits of Albert Einstein (taken as the
melancholy scientist talked about the atom bomb, and how his work
had made it possible), Marilyn Monroe, Alfred Hitchcock and John
Steinbeck. Also here are ``jumpology'' photos, for which Halsman
had dumbfounding luck in convincing subjects to jump up and down
for his camera. Among those who complied: Richard Nixon, Edward
Steichen, J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The American Century'' by Harold Evans (Knopf, $50).
Beginning in 1889, this is an engaging overview of how America and
its international influence has evolved over the last 100 years
(the Clinton years are a frustrating omission, even if Evans did
run out of time and space). It is illustrated with lesser-known
archival photographs, and includes side stories on participants in
world and national events. Once you've hauled this onto your lap
(it is a hefty 700 pages), you won't want to put it down.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Louvre: Portrait of a Museum'' by Nicholas d'Archimbaud
(Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $60). ST&AMP;C puts out beautiful books, and
this one had a head start _ its subject is one of the most
extraordinary museums in the world. D'Archimbaud and a team of
writers profile the Louvre, a city of art within the grand city of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Naked &AMP; the Dressed: 20 Years of Versace by Avedon''
(Random House, $50). You won't even notice the clothes. Or the
words _ there aren't more than 50 in the whole book. These are
flamboyant, ribald, in-your-face photographs of nude people,
vamping people (Elton John is on the cover, in drag), painted
people, contorted people, people you know (The Artist Formerly
Known as Prince, Jon Bon Jovi, Claudia Schiffer) and people you
wouldn't want to meet in a million years. But aren't they great to
look at? And aren't they having the time of their lives?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Story of Opera'' by Richard Somerset-Ward (Abrams,
$49.50). With chapters on the great Italian, German, French,
English and Russian operas and personalities, this volume marks the
400th anniversary of the first performance of the first opera
(``Dafne,'' in Florence in 1598). With a brief foreword by Kiri Te
Kanawa.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Baseball's Greatest Players'' by Ron Smith (The Sporting
News, $29.95). Babe Ruth is Number One. After that you're welcome
to quibble. Here are the 100 best players of all time, chosen by
the staff of ``The Sporting News.'' With a foreword by Willie Mays,
who is happy to be Number Two. In addition, the ``Sporting News''
has teamed up with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on ``Celebrating
70,'' a record of Mark McGwire's pursuit of the single-season home
run record.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tributes: Celebrating 50 Years of New York City Ballet''
(Morrow, $50). A handsome collection of photographs, artworks and
essays inspired by New York City Ballet, its stars and the driving
forces behind it. Contributors include Susan Sontag, Henri
Cartier-Bresson, Ernst Haas, Richard Avedon, Alfred Eisenstaedt,
W.H. Auden, Marianne Moore, Joan Didion, Annie Leibovitz, Roy
Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg and George Plimpton. With a
preface by Peter Martins and a wonderful foreword by Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Illustrated Oxford Dictionary'' (DK, $45). The complementary
strengths of two publishing houses _ Oxford University Press on
language and Dorling Kindersley on illustration _ come together in
a handsome (if airy, for dictionary purists) reference manual. DK
also offers the 720-page ``Art: A World History'' ($59.95), and
Michael Jackson's ``The Ultimate Beer'' ($29.95), a different sort
of reference manual altogether.
</P>
<P>
   _ NASA and the Exploration of Space'' by Roger D. Launius and
Bertram Ulrich (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $60). The story of United
States space exploration, illustrated with paintings and sketches
from the NASA Art Collection. Among the artists are Peter Hurd,
Jamie Wyeth, Norman Rockwell, Robert Rauschenberg and Robert
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road'' (Penguin, $50).
Lots of photos crammed on the page and a text that is straight from
the band _ don't let your kids read it. Or try ``Songs'' by Bruce
Springsteen (Avon, $50), more than 300 pages of photographs, lyrics
and reflections on his music and career. &QL;

 &UR; Lee Lorenz (Artisan, $60)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loves William Steig for his drawings and cartoons, but
we love him for the title of his 1950 book, ``The Agony in the
Kindergarten.'' That volume conjured up the excruciating horrors of
childhood in drawings that were as simple as they were profound.
And yet, writes John Updike in an introduction to this wonderful
retrospective, ``Steig, for all his insight into stunted and
inhibited children, seems to be one of those adults in whom the
creative child has never met discouragement. He has the dauntless
energy of prelapsarian innocence. An Edenic nudity gaily haunts
him.'' Steig began his association with ``The New Yorker'' in 1930,
and over the years became indelibly linked to the look and the
personality of the magazine. Lorenz, who was its art editor for 20
years and cartoon editor until 1997, allows that Steig's
relationship with the magazine was not always an easy one (he
includes, in its entirety, a letter to editor Katharine White in
which the magazine's founder, Harold Ross, picks apart a series of
Steig cartoons). But all was smoothed out in the end, and we are
lucky for it. ``He was, in those citified, civilized pages,
something of a wild man,'' Updike writes, ``but one who knew things
better not forgotten, and whose freedom all could envy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SEXUAL MCCARTHYISM &QL; 
 &UR; Alan M. Dershowitz (Basic, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz says he got the idea for this book when he used the
term ``sexual McCarthyism'' during dinner conversation with Philip
Roth, and Roth insisted that he write something about it. Do you
believe him? Neither do we. We think Dershowitz thought it up all
by himself, from the depths of his media savvy. Having appeared on
television repeatedly to discuss President Clinton's alleged sexual
adventures, he knew there was more to gain by writing it down. But
if there's opportunism around every corner, Dershowitz, at least,
has good timing. While you await the outcome of the impeachment
discussion, read what he thinks about Monica Lewinsky (a ``young
blabbermouth . . . she really did want oral sex: she wanted to talk
about it''), Paula Jones (``a vindictive woman represented by
politically motivated lawyers''), and other attorneys (Robert
Bennett behaved like a ``rank amateur'' and William Ginsburg was
worse). And finally, there are the principles. ``Which is more
dangerous to our liberties?'' he writes. ``A president who may have
had a sexual encounter with a willing intern and then tried to
cover it up? Or a prosecutor who may have leaked secret grand jury
testimony in an effort to get potential witnesses to change that
testimony, and who hid his conflict of interest from the court?''
More important, perhaps: Do the two men deserve each other? After
you read this book, you'll have no doubt about what Dershowitz
thinks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A DIARY OF THE NAZI YEARS 1933-1941 &QL; 
 &UR; Victor Klemperer (Random House, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   March 10, 1933, Friday evening: ``Hitler Chancellor. What, up to
election Sunday on March 5, I called terror, was a mild prelude.
Now the business of 1918 is being exactly repeated, only under a
different sign, under the swastika. Again it's astounding how
easily everything collapses.'' Victor Klemperer, a German and a Jew
by birth, had kept a diary since he was 17. By the time Hitler
began his rise to power, Klemperer was a scholar, a literary
journalist and the husband of a Protestant woman, and it was this
final, fragile stroke of luck that helped him survive the
Holocaust. In 1945, he was one of 198 registered Jews left in
Dresden _ since 1941, more than 1,000 others had been deported to
concentration camps, many murdered upon arrival. Klemperer's
diaries of the Nazi years record the momentous, the horrific and
the mundane, including random acts of goodness and conscience by
ordinary Germans that serve to rebut the indictment made by Daniel
Goldhagen in his controversial book ``Hitler's Willing
Executioners.'' Klemperer's remarkable diaries were found by one of
his students after his death in 1960, and were published in Germany
in 1995 to great acclaim. They will be released here in two
installments _ the second, covering 1941 to 1945, will be published
next year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUNDRED DOLLAR HOLIDAY &QL; 
 &UR; Bill McKibben (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $12)
</P>
<P>
   We are, McKibben writes (``The End of Nature''), ``a species
hemmed in by stuff.'' Christmas for our children has become a loot
fest, the holidays a time to ``get through.'' This little book is a
pep talk, of sorts, a call to reverse the process and celebrate in
a more meaningful way. It grew out of a project that began nearly
10 years ago at McKibben's church in rural New York. Participants
encouraged their friends and families to limit the amount of money
they spent on the holiday to $100. As McKibben traveled to
neighboring churches to enlist them in the program, he realized
that they were not searching for a simpler Christmas. ``We wanted a
more joyous Christmas,'' he writes. ``We were feeling cheated _ as
if the season didn't bring with it the happiness we wanted.''
McKibben's suggestions are gentle and non-threatening, and he
admits that it might take years to work your family down from the
materialistic heights. Even if you never make it to $100, it's
worthwhile to stop and think about what you have, and about what
you're missing. &QL;

AN ORANGE-CHOCOLATE CANDY BECOMES A CAKE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I can't remember just when I decided to pump up the
muscadine into a full-size cake, but I do remember the reaction of
my French colleagues: surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the muscadine is a candy, always chocolate and
orange, always about the size of a Tootsie Roll _ and always as
popular as a truffle. This confection is meltingly smooth on the
inside and ever-so-slightly crackly on the outside, the result of
its being brushed with chocolate, which hardens into a shell. The
outer chocolate is kept rough and craggy so that when it is rolled
in powdered sugar, it looks like the bark of a snow-dusted tree.
Enlarged from candy to cake, it makes an untraditional but ideal
buche de Noel.
</P>
<P>
   In my rendition, I play with the chocolate and orange base in
several ways. The heart of my muscadine, which is essentially a
jellyroll, is a feather-light rectangle of ladyfinger cake, whose
crumb is designed to sop up liquids and creams. Here, it soaks up a
Grand Marnier sugar syrup and is rolled up with a bitter-chocolate
ganache studded with store-bought candied orange zest. Then it is
finished in the same way the candy is _ with chocolate and sugar.
If you want to give it a straight-from-the-patisserie look,
decorate it with caramel spikes or buy (or make) a few meringue
mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   This cake is great whether you make it the day you serve it or
whether you prepare it _ up to the chocolate coating _ a month in
advance and keep it stowed in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   MUSCADINE YULE LOG
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour 40 minutes' refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces bittersweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped candied orange zest (at specialty
food stores)
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   } cup confectioners' sugar, plus extra for sprinkling and
dredging
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 3 tablespoons cake flour
</P>
<P>
   Caramel spikes, optional (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare chocolate ganache: Finely chop 6 ounces of the
chocolate, and place in a mixing bowl. In a small saucepan, bring
cream to a boil. Whisk hot cream into chocolate until smooth, then
add orange zest and stir to mix well. Set aside to cool and
thicken, or chill 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare Grand Marnier syrup: In a small saucepan, combine
sugar with \ cup water. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
Stir in the Grand Marnier, then set aside to cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 15-by-10-inch jellyroll
pan with parchment paper, allowing paper to overlap slightly at
ends.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a mixer, whisk egg whites until foamy. Gradually add {
cup of the confectioners' sugar, and beat until whites form firm,
glossy peaks. In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks by hand with \ cup
confectioners' sugar. Add vanilla, and whisk to blend. Turn mixer
to lowest speed, and add yolk mixture to whites, mixing only to
combine; do not overmix. Place flour in a sifter, and sift over
mixture. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the flour. Scrape
mixture into jellyroll pan, and smooth the top. Sprinkle cake
lightly with 2 tablespoons of confectioners' sugar. Let it sit 5
minutes; sprinkle with 2 more tablespoons confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake cake until lightly golden and springy to the touch,
about 10 minutes. Slide it on the parchment paper onto a rack, and
cool to room temperature. Place a piece of parchment paper on the
counter, and invert the cake on the paper. Peel away the baking
paper. Brush Grand Marnier syrup over the surface of the cake.
Using an offset spatula, spread the chocolate ganache evenly over
the syrup. Starting from one of the shorter ends of the cake, using
the paper for assistance, roll up the cake. Cover with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. (The cake can be chilled, and
when set, wrapped airtight and frozen for 1 month.)
</P>
<P>
   6. Just before serving, spread a generous amount of
confectioners' sugar on a baking sheet. Chop and melt the remaining
4 ounces of chocolate. Unwrap the cold cake, and brush it with a
coating of melted chocolate, then roll it in confectioners' sugar.
Return cake to refrigerator for 5 minutes to set the chocolate,
then transfer to a serving platter. If desired, decorate with
Caramel Spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

RICE ACCEPTS DIMINISHED ROLE WITH 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice made a great cutback move on Monday
night. He was wearing a gray flannel suit and a bright smile when
he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the season I have to play a different role,'' he
said in the locker room after the San Francisco 49ers beat the New
York Giants, 31-7. ``You've got to swallow deep and live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the new, mellow Jerry Rice, the antidote to the
perfectionist Jerry Rice, the flip side of the petulant, frustrated
superstar who stalked out of the locker room a week before.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the two guys looked the same, making three catches
each week, unable to shake the cornerbacks who would have knotted
themselves into ineffectual pretzels trying to cover the Jerry Rice
of yore.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Rice needed to shake off more than pesky
defensive backs. He had a selfishness rap to lose.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, he threatened retirement. This week, he said he
planned to savor what remained of his career. Last week, he was the
picture of misery. This week, he almost made fun of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he went up to Terrell Owens after the young receiver
went 79 yards for a touchdown and said: ``I remember doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't imagine why defensive coordinators would
still bother double-teaming him. After all, he is a gimpy old dude,
playing on a reconstructed knee and borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he'd like to prove otherwise. On Monday, he couldn't,
even though 11 passes went his way, six of them in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He caught three all night, for just 25 yards. The good ones, the
high-flying footballs, fell short or long or right out of his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the Niners still won big, while Rice tended to his other
mission. He knew that after last week's outburst, everyone was
watching him. The ABC cameras followed him constantly, panning to
him on the sidelines whenever possible, gauging his response.
</P>
<P>
   He knew this would happen. He had become national news, bigger
even than officials who don't know heads from tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard I was on the Internet, I was all over the place,'' he
said, smiling, aggressively jovial.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice, the receiver, may have lost a step this year. But
Jerry Rice, the consummate star, the immaculate dresser, still
knows how to tidy up a mess.
</P>
<P>
   When Owens scored, he raced down to offer congratulations. He
did it again when Irv Smith scored. The cameras would not catch him
being anything less than the ideal teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Even when guard Kevin Gogan ran into him late in the first
quarter, he turned it into a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he weigh? 320 pounds?'' Rice said, wide-eyed, in
mock horror.
</P>
<P>
   Gogan managed to wrench Rice's neck slightly, putting him on the
bench with an ice pack for a good part of the second quarter. Gogan
thought he was doing Rice a favor when he ran toward a stack of
Giants gang-tackling the receiver. They were standing Rice up, and
Gogan anticipated a cheap shot. He went barreling in to disperse
the Giants, and got Rice by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was laughing about it later, but I think he was kind of
bitter at first,'' Gogan said. ``The guy I was playing against
said: `You know, if you hurt him, they're probably going to cut you
at halftime.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rice spent a lot of time after the game trying to clarify what
he had said last week. He said he was hurt to hear people calling
him selfish, and he insisted that he hadn't gone into a snit over
catching only three balls against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Rice repeated his midweek argument that he was only trying to
rejuvenate the offense, push it to be better. The news media, he
contended, blew his remarks out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said: ``I was unhappy about catching three balls,
but who wouldn't be, as a competitor?''
</P>
<P>
   He kept smiling the whole time. Someone asked whether he might
break out during the playoffs. He agreed that it was a possibility.
Or maybe, he said, ``next year, come out more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rice said he could accept a lesser role this year, while his
knee perks up, and while Owens and J.J. Stokes grow into
accomplished veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to enjoy myself, smile, watch these young guys
make plays and do what I can,'' he said. ``I don't want to lower my
standards, but I've got to enjoy (football) because it's going to
end soon.''
</P>
<P>
   This had to be a hard admission for Rice. He and Steve Mariucci
met this week, and perhaps the head coach helped him see that he
has a lot to contribute, as long as he doesn't insist on doing
everything.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process every superstar faces in the final years of a
long career. Rice may have a lot of time left, and a better season
ahead. But every game brings the end closer.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Niners were reminded of their professional mortality
when Bryant Young's leg snapped late in Monday's game. Almost a
year ago, on another Monday night, Rice lay in the end zone, his
knee cracked, the very knee that had blown out in September.
</P>
<P>
   He came back too early for his own good, trying to set healing
records that aren't meant to be broken. He was Icarus that night,
with melted wings. For most of this season, too, he has expected
too much, from himself, from a team in transition.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he said he had arrived at acceptance. It's not quite
the end zone, Rice's usual habitat. But he had to show that he
could get there.

 &HT;    Unruly topic, critics won't derail a writer
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Ann Waldron, writer and very special human being, is
having a time with critics these days. Some like her new book on
Eudora Welty, ``A Writer's Life'' (Doubleday, $25.95), and some are
tearing it and the author apart.
</P>
<P>
   Annie herself says that writing it with no help from Miss Welty,
in fact total hindrance from the author, was ``pure hell.'' But
having known Annie for most of her life, I know she isn't wringing
her hands and weeping somewhere in Princeton, N.J. She is taking
praise and mean criticism in good heart and probably even now
planning her next book.
</P>
<P>
   Ann came to The Atlanta Constitution fresh out of the University
of Alabama shortly after I got here in the early 1940s. I didn't
cotton to her at first because she filed things. I never knew a
newspaper reporter who had files. I do now. But then I thought it
was a business office attitude and sheer pretension.
</P>
<P>
   So I wasn't taken with the bouncy dark-haired Alabama kid until
a great thing happened. She couldn't decide whether to file 4-H for
the 4-H clubs of Georgia under ``F'' for four or ``H'' for what is
it, head, heart, hands and health? I knew she couldn't be all bad,
and I warmed to her immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, she came to live at my house on 13th Street,
transforming the little sun parlor into a bed-sitting room suitable
for receiving company. She did complain that the street light on
the front sidewalk was a deterrent to romance.
</P>
<P>
   Her dates, mostly young fellows from the newspaper, were
reluctant to kiss her good night under that bright beam. One,
however, took the street light in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Young Martin O. Waldron from Pelham was so devoted to Ann that
when my youngest child, all broken out with mumps, crawled in his
lap and hugged him, he didn't complain. He didn't even suggest
postponing their wedding, although friends told him if he caught
Mary's mumps he would be rendered impotent. I guess he wasn't,
because they had four children.
</P>
<P>
   We all went to their wedding in Birmingham, and I stood in as an
older female friend, driving Mr. Waldron's old car around to meet
friends at the airport, pick up the music for the soloist and
transport the wedding cake. The back door of the car kept popping
open, and I nearly lost the cake and a couple of my children.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, called Mow for the initials he typed at the top of his
copy, became an outstanding reporter, winning a Pulitzer Prize for
his series on highway corruption in Florida. I worked beside him
when we both covered the James Earl Ray trial for the killing of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the murder trial of novelist
Jesse Hill Ford in Humboldt, Tenn. While her husband was doing
that, Ann was writing books and working on The Tallahassee
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   I met her on the Lady Bird Johnson campaign train. She invited
me and Claude Sitton of The New York Times to go home with her for
baths when the train overnighted in Tallahassee. You couldn't get a
bath on the train.
</P>
<P>
   Ann has written a lot of books. The two immediately preceding
the Eudora Welty biography were on Caroline Gordon, wife of poet
Allen Tate of the celebrated Fugitives, and Hodding Carter Jr., the
liberal Mississippi newspaper editor. I'm sorry Miss Welty didn't
realize that she had a fine biographer in Annie and cooperate, but
when you're that old _ 89 _ and that accomplishing, I suppose you
can choose.

EGYPTIAN-REOPENING (Los Angeles) _ When the Egyptian Theater opened
in 1922 it was the poshest theater in Hollywood, premiering both
``The Gold Rush'' and ``Ben Hur.'' It fell into disrepair over the
years, closing in 1992. But in 1996, the American Cinemathique

Garland warbling ``Over the Rainbow''? Shirley Bassey belting out
``Goldfinger''? Her impersonations are so good that the producers
of her showcase film, ``Little Voice,'' felt it necessary to add a
prominent postscript at the end of the movie declaring that the
actress did indeed do all her own singing. By Glenn Whipp.

   LOS ANGELES _ It was 1922, and this was the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Red carpets, klieg lights and screaming fans set the mood as
Tinseltown's brightest stars stepped out for the first-ever
Hollywood premiere at the exotic and mysterious Egyptian Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``On premiere nights, you couldn't move for the people,''
recalls philanthropist Lloyd E. Rigler, who in the 1940s lived just
a block and a half from the famed movie palace. ``Everybody in the
world would come out to see the stars walk down the red carpet. The
police would have to hold them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Hollywood Boulevard movie house, which wowed
pharaoh-frenzied moviegoers when it opened, is getting ready to
take another bow _ 76 years later.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 75 years to the date after Cecil B. DeMille's ``The
Ten Commandments'' premiered there, the red carpet will be unrolled
again as Hollywood's glitterati gather for an invitation-only gala
marking the reopening of the theater, which has been restored and
largely rebuilt to be the first permanent home of the 14-year-old,
nonprofit American Cinematheque film society.
</P>
<P>
   After the VIP gala, featuring a showing of DeMille's silent
classic accompanied by a full orchestra, the film will be shown to
the public (accompanied by organ music) the next four nights in the
ornate old theater.
</P>
<P>
   Rigler, who donated $1.5 million toward the $14.2 million
project and for whom the 630-seat main theater is named, said the
reopening is a vital step in the revitalization of a Hollywood
whose glimmer has dimmed as porno palaces and souvenir stands have
replaced posh restaurants and high-end clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   When Rigler moved to Hollywood from New York in the early 1940s,
Tinseltown seemed to have a permanent prewar hustle and bustle
about it. And so did the theater, which was a stopping-off point
for tourists and local folk alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never went to a premiere there myself,'' said Rigler, 83.
``I couldn't even always afford a ticket back then. But I used to
be there to see the (premiere) festivities, usually watching from
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even going to a regular show there, it was an exciting theater
to attend. It was different than any other theater in town.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through its forecourt, past high stone walls, is akin to
approaching an Egyptian temple built of block after block of
desert-weathered sandstone. A giant wooden door, topped by the
painting of a stylized eagle with wings spread wide, is flanked by
two giant sculptures, the heads of some nameless pharaohs. Four
giant pillars covered by Egyptian characters usher moviegoers into
what almost appears to be a low-ceilinged tomb, dark and quiet
after the brilliant sunlight outside, its ceilings and beams
covered with mysterious hieroglyphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater's on the National Register of Historic Places, so
we have to be historically accurate,'' said Margot Gerber,
spokeswoman for American Cinematheque, on a recent tour of the old
theater. ``We're restoring it as much as possible to the way it
looked in 1922.''
</P>
<P>
   That has included restoring damaged original artworks and
sculptures, repainting and replanting papyrus and palms in the
forecourt. It has also meant major structural restoration and
rebuilding to repair damage to walls and the ceiling caused by the
1994 Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But American Cinematheque was thinking of more than restoration
when it bought into a piece of Hollywood history. The plan is to
bring back the crowds of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   So along with the Egyptian architecture, there are also new,
state-of-the-art sound and projection systems, a combination
bookstore and souvenir stand, a new balcony that's accessible to
movie buffs in wheelchairs, plush reclining seats and new wall
panels to enhance the acoustics in a theater originally built to
show only silent movies. The main theater is also equipped with a
1922 Wurlitzer organ to provide accompaniment for silent movies. A
second, 83-seat theater, named after director Steven Spielberg,
will provide viewing for small groups and students.
</P>
<P>
   As the date for the reopening night gala draws near, the racket
of workers' drills, the thump of hammers and the sound of shouted
directions fill the rebuilt theater as crews work feverishly to
finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Even the workers are caught up in the excitement of the old
theater's rebirth, said Ron Lindsay, senior project manager for
Turner Construction, which began renovating the Egyptian 13 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about the first five months, people started seeing it
come together,'' Lindsay said. ``All of a sudden, the craftsmanship
really kicked in, and even the plumbers and the electricians feel a
part of it. They're very proud of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the theater _ which triggered a wave of Egyptian
revival theaters across the nation _ was to have a Moorish-Spanish
theme.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1922, Americans became fascinated by the dusty doings in
Egypt's far-off Valley of the Kings, where archeologists searched
tirelessly for untouched tombs. As fascinated as everybody else,
theatrical entrepreneur Sid Grauman, who in 1927 would move on to
build the Chinese Theatre two blocks down the street, scrapped the
original design and decreed that instead of minarets, his new
theater would have kingly sarcophagi, that ancient hieroglyphics
should cover walls and that sculptures of the pharaohs themselves
should greet moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt business, either, when _ almost as if the master
showman had planned it _ a month after the October 1922 opening of
the grand new movie house, King Tutankhamen's tomb was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Egyptian that the Hollywood premiere was born on
Oct. 18, 1922, as Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks held court
before the debut of Fairbanks' film, ``Robin Hood.'' Preceding the
film, Grauman presented the Egyptian-themed opera, ``Aida.''
Tickets for the premiere were $5, a price far above the means of
ordinary Hollywood residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian, which had several owners, also underwent many
changes during its lifetime, getting a new marquee, box office and
courtyard renovation in the 1940s and '50s. In 1955, showman Mike
Todd ripped out pillars, sphinxes, the proscenium arch decorated
with hieroglyphs and the 30-foot stage on which live acts were
performed between movies so he could install a massive curved
screen for the road show engagement of ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes that altered its original character, the
movie house remained an enormously popular venue. Unlike other
theaters, where the bill changed from week to week, some movies
played there for years, as successful live shows do on Broadway.
Both ``South Pacific'' and ``My Fair Lady'' ran for more than a
year, and ``Ben Hur'' ran for two years. The last premiere was
staged in 1968, for ``Funny Girl,'' which also ran for a year.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the theater fell into disrepair and eventually found
itself playing third- and fourth-run films, with tickets selling in
1992 for the same $1.50 moviegoers paid 60 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Redevelopment Agency bought the theater for $1.7
million in 1992, intending to restore it and lease it out, but the
damage from the 1994 earthquake made it a financial liability. So
American Cinematheque, which was looking for a permanent home,
bought it from the city in 1996 for $1. The city provided a grant
of $3 million toward its repair and loaned another $2 million in
earthquake recovery funds.
</P>
<P>
   Others have donated funds, too. In addition to Rigler's
contribution, AC received a donation large enough (but the amount
still undisclosed) from Warner Bros. to name the smaller theater
after Spielberg; other individuals and studios have also pledged
cash.
</P>
<P>
   But AC is still about $4 million short of being able to pay off
the loans it took out to finance reconstruction. To make up the
difference, it's selling practically anything you can carve a name
into between the sidewalk and the front door: a paving stone in the
foyer can be had for $5,000 to $50,000; for $75,000, donors can
have their names engraved next to one of 12 palm trees in the
forecourt; and donors of $100,000 to $500,000 can have their names
permanently placed on one of the glass panels in the theater lobby.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's grand reopening will be short-lived. After the
festivities, the doors will be closed again while crews who
struggled to make the old movie house presentable renovate six
small shops along the theater's forecourt and a rooftop area above
that eventually will become a 130-seat restaurant and bar, said
Gerber.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is expected to open permanently _ this time without
fanfare _ next spring, offering nightly showings of Hollywood
classics, including silent movies, and independent films. During
the day, the theater will be open to tourists, who'll be able to
see a documentary film about the history of Hollywood, with a
musical prologue on the Wurlitzer organ and historic newsreel
footage.
</P>
<P>
   Rigler said he can't wait until the Egyptian is part of the
Hollywood landscape again, open to sightseers and moviegoers and
visitors who just want to drop by to shop or enjoy a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can make Hollywood safe to walk through again, for
people to come out and have a good time like they used to,'' he
said, ``that will be my legacy.''

KGIL'S `MUSIC OF YOUR LIFE' WINNING FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whoever said music is ailing on the AM dial surely
hasn't heard KGIL-AM (1260), whose syndicated ``Music of Your
Life'' format is winning fans across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The format _ generically known as adult pop standards _ features
such core artists as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Barbra Streisand,
Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole, plus contemporary singers like
Natalie Cole, Diana Krall, James Taylor and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``An hour will not go by without hearing one of our core artists
if not all five,'' promises Chuck Southcott, KGIL's programmer and
afternoon host.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter Arbitron survey, KGIL appeared for the first time
in almost three years. Even though ``Music of Your Life'' did not
become KGIL's format until March 2, the strength of its ratings for
that single month was enough to put the station into the survey for
the entire three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the essence of the old KMPC and KGIL formats,''
Southcott explained. ``We've kept that tradition alive and brought
it into a new era on a national basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The format has 111 affiliates with stations in seven out of the
nation's 10 major radio markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to today's technology, many of the station's disc jockeys
work out of their homes. Southcott, for example, tapes his show at
his Granada Hills home studio, then overnights the digital
audiotape to Denver where the satellite uplink is located.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Southcott on KGIL's airwaves are such veteran
broadcasters as Gary Owens and Wink Martindale. In addition,
entertainers Patti Page and Pat Boone both host weekend shows.
</P>
<P>
   EASE ON DOWN THE ROAD: Talk outlet KRLA-AM (1110) breaks new
ground this weekend when the curtain goes up on what's billed as
the first radio program devoted to Los Angeles driving and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour ``Traffic Jam,'' co-hosted by Kenny Morse and
Reed Berry, will focus on such topics as road rage, how to fight a
ticket, teen and elderly drivers, buying a car and road safety.
</P>
<P>
   The show airs at 10 a.m. Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Morse and Berry have taught at the Improv Traffic School, which
offers comedy along with the serious side of driver education.
</P>
<P>
   `ROCKLINE' COMING BACK: After a two-year break from the local
airwaves, the music-interview show ``Rockline'' will return Jan. 6
to rock 'n' roll oldies KCBS-FM (93.1) _ aka Arrow 93. Arrow's
afternoon jock Bob Coburn hosts. ... Ex-KLOS-FM (95.5) afternoon
driver Geno Michellini signs on as vice president/radio operations
for the Ion Radio Network, a new syndication company. Michellini is
producing several shows and co-hosting the blues program ``That's
the Blues,'' which might surface on KLOS.

PLAYING IT BY EAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ English actress Jane Horrocks can do a dead-on
imitation of just about any singing diva you can name. Judy Garland
warbling ``Over the Rainbow''? No problem. Shirley Bassey belting
out ``Goldfinger''? Can do. Marilyn Monroe cooing her way through
``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend''? Easily done.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, maybe a little too easily done. Horrocks'
impersonations are so good that the producers of her showcase film,
``Little Voice,'' felt it necessary to add a prominent postscript
at the end of the movie declaring that the actress did indeed do
all her own singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get asked about it all the time, though,'' Horrocks
says, laughing. ``I don't know why. I would have to be a brilliant
mime artist if I had actually lip-synched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Horrocks will have to content herself with being hailed
as a brilliant impressionist _ and not a bad actress, either. In
``Little Voice,'' she plays a fragile young woman who barely speaks
but can uncannily imitate the singing voices and personas of stars
like Garland, Bassey, Monroe and Marlene Dietrich. It's a role
Horrocks originated six years ago at the London National Theater in
Jim Cartwright's popular play, ``The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The play created such a fantastic atmosphere,'' says producer
Elizabeth Karlsen. ``What appealed to me most was the way it turned
the story of someone finding her own voice into at once a `Wizard
of Oz'-style fable and a moving drama presented with brilliant,
contemporary music. It was very clever and I thought it had the
potential to make a wonderful film.''
</P>
<P>
   That potential languished for a long time, to the point where
Horrocks, who performed the role on stage for eight months, became
kind of bored with the whole thing. ``Too much on-again, off-again,
on-again stuff for me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Several playwrights and screenwriters had a crack at turning it
into a movie, while Horrocks moved on to television and movies,
most notably, playing the quarrelsome bulimic in Mike Leigh's
``Life Is Sweet'' and a flighty PR assistant on ``Absolutely
Fabulous.'' Just when she had all but forgotten about LV, she got a
call from writer-director Mark Herman, saying he was going to make
``Little Voice'' into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, who adapted and directed the hit play ``Brassed Off''
two years ago for Miramax, concedes adapting the play to the big
screen was no ordinary task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can easily say it was the hardest writing job I've ever done
because, in essence, the play is about a girl who never leaves her
room, and that's not very cinematic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best resource we had was Jane,'' Herman continues. ``I
wouldn't be doing the film without her. She has lived with the
character for so long that it really is a part of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds producer Karlsen: ``What makes Jane so perfect is that she
is physically very tiny with this wonderful, childlike face and
haircut. Yet out of this fragile figure comes this unbelievably
huge voice.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long layoff, Horrocks had to reacquaint herself with the
dynamics of belting out Bassey. She started doing singing
impersonations when she was 10 years old, singing along with her
parents' record albums to entertain guests at parties. When
playwright Cartwright heard the imitations while doing a show with
Horrocks, he decided to write an entire play around her talents.
Thus, ``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice'' came into existence.
</P>
<P>
   For the movie, which co-stars Brenda Blethyn as LV's
ear-splitting mother and Michael Caine as the small-time talent
agent who hopes to cash in on her talent, Herman decided to film
Horrocks' big musical performance entirely live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want anyone to think there was any trick to it,''
Herman says. ``I thought it had to feel like it was happening in
the here and now. It was extremely difficult to do, but I think it
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did. Horrocks' dynamic singing and stage presence
prove to be so raw and immediate that the audience almost needs
that postscript during the final credits to assure themselves that
the whole thing isn't some elaborate trick. Horrocks is just happy
the performance finally has been captured on film. She's five
months pregnant and has a 1-year-old son already in tow, so her
schedule doesn't allow her much time for performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have time to listen to music anymore,'' Horrocks
says, sighing. ``And as for my singing, I did try to sing some Judy
Garland to my boy once when he was 5 months old. He screamed bloody
murder. I'm afraid my singing career _ at least around the house _
is over and done.''

A SIMPLE SOUP TURNED ELEGANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipes at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many soups have extraordinarily simple origins, none more so
than the ancient peasant dish of southern France called, in
dialect, l'aigo boulido _ ``boiled water.'' At its most
impoverished, this is no more than garlic simmered in water to give
it flavor, with a few crusts of bread added for bulk.
</P>
<P>
   But ``boiled water'' is the perfect example of how an almost
absurdly simple preparation can be quickly and easily converted
into one that is nearly grand; all it takes is the addition of a
few common ingredients, and a quick technique or two.
</P>
<P>
   By gently cooking the garlic in olive oil, you add the
complexity and color of the browning process and turn the soup into
a flavorful, dark broth; by crisping the bread in the same oil, you
immeasurably increase its appeal. Using stock in place of water is
a no-brainer; this is a great place for canned stock, as the
garlic-scented oil will raise it to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, after all of this tinkering the resulting soup remains
on the meager side, but it requires only one more ingredient to
turn it into a meal. That ingredient, which will dominate the soup,
can be almost anything you can cut into bite-size chunks, from
carrots to boneless pork. My choice is almost always shrimp, for
two reasons: it adds great flavor of its own, and the shells can be
used to make shrimp-shell stock.
</P>
<P>
   Making this stock is the work of a moment: put shrimp shells in
a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil and simmer about five
minutes; then strain. The liquid can be used in many shrimp dishes,
or in place of fish stock in most recipes. You can accumulate
shells and freeze them over a period of months if you like, and
there's no need to defrost them before making the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of stock made by the pound or so of shrimp I use in
this recipe isn't enough to complete the soup, but its volume can
be increased with water or chicken stock. If you have some of the
latter, it's worth using, as the combined flavor of the shrimp and
chicken stocks is really quite magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   To make the soup even more flavorful, brown a little spice in
the oil after removing the bread and before adding the stock. I
especially like a combination of cumin and paprika (about a
teaspoon of each), which gives the soup a decidedly Spanish
feeling. But curry powder, mild chili powder, a pinch of cayenne or
a few rosemary leaves are all possibilities; this is a good place
to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess that I almost always double the amount of bread
given in the recipe here, or at least make an extra slice or two
for myself; I find the allure of bread crisped in garlic-scented
oil irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC SOUP WITH SHRIMP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   \ cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8 to 16 medium to large cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 thick slices French or Italian bread
</P>
<P>
   6 cups shrimp stock, chicken stock, water or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1{ pounds shrimp, peeled (deveining is optional)
</P>
<P>
   Minced fresh parsley leaves for garnish (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine olive oil and garlic in a deep skillet or broad
saucepan and turn heat to medium. Sprinkle cloves lightly with salt
and pepper, and cook, turning occasionally, until they are tender
and lightly browned all over, about 10 minutes; lower heat if they
seem to be browning too quickly. Remove garlic with a slotted
spoon.

   2. Turn heat to low and add bread (in batches, if necessary);
cook on each side until nicely browned, about 4 minutes total.
Remove bread, add stock and raise heat to medium high.
</P>
<P>
   3. When stock is nearly boiling, add shrimp and salt and pepper
to taste. Cook until shrimp are pink, about 4 minutes. Place a
piece of bread and some garlic cloves in each of 4 bowls; then
ladle in a portion of soup and shrimp. Sprinkle with parsley and
serve.

MEMORIES OF MEXICO, SEASONED BY TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The memoirist approach to cookbook writing is winning out.
Increasingly, cookbooks are autobiographies instead of mere
collections of recipes. There are two recent books of this kind,
both about Mexican cooking by women who were not born in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosa Mexicano'' by Josefina Howard (Viking, $29.95), is the
first book by Ms. Howard, the owner of the Upper East Side
restaurant Rosa Mexicano in New York City. Punctuated with recipes,
it sketches the details of her life. ``My Mexico'' by Diana Kennedy
(Clarkson N. Potter, $32.50), the sixth book about Mexican cookery
by Ms. Kennedy, one of the world's foremost experts on the subject,
is her most autobiographical work.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, ``Rosa Mexicano'' offers a more compelling personal
story. But its recipes are no match for Ms. Kennedy's.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Howard was born in Cuba of Spanish parents who were involved
in the arts. She lived in Spain, and fled the country with her
mother during the Spanish Civil War after her father, who opposed
Franco, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually made their way to New York, where Ms. Howard
finished school, studied interior design, then married an American,
Charles Howard. The cookbook-as-autobiography can be vague about
certain details, one of which here is Howard's profession.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the couple and their infant son moved first to
Cuba, then to Mexico City, where Ms. Howard started an interior
decorating business and gradually became interested in, then
fascinated by the food of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then the story _ which is interspersed with a collection of
fairly basic recipes _ shifts constantly from autobiographical
details, including the breakup of her marriage, her eventual return
to New York and her start in the restaurant business, to historic
explanations of essential foods, to how these foods eventually
became part of the menu at Rosa Mexicano.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Howard begins with tortillas, the very basis of Mexican
cookery, and quickly moves on to cuitlacoche, the delicious but
fairly esoteric corn fungus, accompanied by a truly revolting
photograph of bloated, blackened ears of corn. Next on the menu is
the maguey worm, another delicacy. There are sections covering
beans, mushrooms, moles, sweets and, finally, chilies, which are
described in excellent detail. She offers lively glimpses of life
in Mexico and especially in Mexico City in the 1960s and 70s. The
recipes worked reasonably well, but the dishes hardly break new
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kennedy, who was born in England, moved to Mexico in 1957,
after marrying Paul Kennedy, who was a correspondent for The New
York Times. She has lived in Mexico ever since, and now makes her
home in Zitacuaro, west of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mexico'' gives an account of travels that take her all over
Mexico, mainly to ferret out cooks and their regional specialties.
She does not mince words, whether describing the ``grossly
overcooked'' fish at restaurants in Campeche or calling for
ecological respect for the land.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring the reminiscences are the recipes, many of them
unusual, rustic and delectable, like a type of pozole, or hominy
stew, made with fresh corn; skillet-roasted potatoes with chili;
zucchini with sausage; shrimp in green sauce, and steamed tacos
filled with shredded skirt steak.
</P>
<P>
   She describes some things, however, that you might not be in a
rush to make. Flying ants (the mere mention of which makes her
mouth water), for example, or the first ant eggs of the season
fried with chilies. Black wasps make their way into her accounts of
gastronomic adventure. Who can top a recipe for mole of black
iguana (``But take heart, you can also use pork'')?
</P>
<P>
   She is (and always has been) uncompromising. The first recipe in
the book, for tamales with corn tassels that also requires the
fermented drink pulque (use light beer instead), gives you some
idea.
</P>
<P>
   In another, she says, ``Open the steamer and bless it with a
double sign of the cross.'' Substitute one chili for another at
your peril. (There is a useful chart on chilies in the back of the
book.) And do not (italics)ever(end italics) use canned hominy in
your pozole (something that does not appear to trouble Ms. Howard).
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to understand how either of these books, and
especially ``My Mexico,'' could have been published without a map.
Keep an atlas at your side as you read them. &QL;

WINE TALK: HOW HIGH CAN THE BURGUNDY MARKET GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, a handful of top chateaus like Latour and Margaux
set the pricing pattern for the rest of the region. Each spring,
when they announce their prices for the previous vintage, everyone
else soon follows, taking their cues from the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy it's done at an auction. Every year, on the third
Sunday of November, the Hospice de Beaune, a hospital that is
supported by charity _ and that happens to own some very fine
vineyards _ auctions off its wines. The prices those wines command
set the pattern for the rest of the burgundy trade.
</P>
<P>
   After four straight years of hefty increases, including a
jaw-dropping 47 percent rise last year, prices were expected to
fall this time. They did not. Though the 1998 vintage was not an
outstanding one, prices rose an average of 12 percent over 1997
levels. The increase for reds averaged 15 percent, and for whites 5
percent. Some red wines were up 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results were explained by the winemakers' trade organization
as a consequence of ``international demand,'' and the trade group
hailed them as ``a measure of the optimism of the world's
markets.'' But not everyone was pleased. Frederic Drouhin, of the
prominent old Burgundy wine house Joseph Drouhin, had warned that
unless 1998 prices dropped at least 15 percent, Burgundy would be
``in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Negociants like Drouhin, which buy wine or grapes from small
producers, fear that prices could climb beyond the reach of most
consumers, causing the market to collapse. The best wines of the
1998 vintage will not reach store shelves for another 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hospice de Beaune auction is a charity affair and
attracts wide public attention, its prices tend to be a bit
inflated. But in the normal course of business, prices are not that
much lower, because the demand for good burgundy is high,
especially in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, particularly Japan, is still an important factor in the
Burgundy wine business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a massive increase in our sales to Japan,'' said
Pierre-Henry Gagey, the president of the Louis Jadot company and
also of the Burgundy shippers' syndicate. Exports to Japan of
burgundy wines, both red and white, have more than doubled in
recent months, surpassing exports to both Germany and the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So eager were buyers at the hospice auction that a 300-bottle
barrel of Clos de la Roche, a red that sold for $13,500 in 1997,
brought almost $16,600 this year, while a barrel of
Batard-Montrachet, Dames de Flandres, which brought about $26,000
last year, went for about $27,600. That last number translates to
about $92 for a 750-milliliter bottle, before cellaring, bottling
and shipping. At retail, a bottle will sell for well over $200.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns of the negociants, these are euphoric times
for the growers and small producers in Burgundy. ``Never complain
that the bride is too beautiful,'' one of them told Le Monde. But
then he added, ``Even so, everyone knows there are going to be
tough times ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Burgundy has all but run out of space to produce fine
wine, while plantings of Burgundy's two principal grapes, pinot
noir and chardonnay, are increasing rapidly elsewhere in the world,
often resulting in high-quality, burgundian-style wines.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the temptation to increase yields has always been a
serious problem in Burgundy. But higher yields can produce insipid
wines, which once led to rampant and illegal strengthening with
heavier wines from the Rhone or the Midi. Quality is important to
Burgundy producers now, and few of them are willing to lower
standards. Which means even higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers and restaurants are just beginning to buy the
1997 burgundies. Al Hotchkin, of Burgundy Wine Co., a retailer in
New York, said he did not expect any ``ridiculous increases''
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that there will be increases,'' he said,
``but that they will tend to be at the lower end, for wines like
Hautes-Cotes-de-Nuits and Bourgogne blanc. The high-end wines, the
premier cru and grand cru, will tend to hold at current levels or
just show modest rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnnes, who is both an importer and the wine buyer for
Montrachet restaurant in New York, said he was not eager to buy
either the 1997s or 1998s, because he did not believe their quality
warranted the prices being asked. But he was not too concerned that
his wine cellar would run short of burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the 1995s and 1996s, both excellent years, and put
them away,'' he said. ``We're in pretty good shape.''

RIFFS, NOT RECIPES: IMPROVISATIONAL COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By POLLY FROST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a decade ago, we were staying with two other couples in a
rented beach house, and the agreement was that each of us would
cook one meal. For mine, I was carrying a photocopy of a
time-tested recipe. I spent a sunny, breezy day racing down
supermarket aisles collecting ingredients. But the basil and
saffron the recipe called for? None available.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen I played fast and loose with garlic and pepper,
but nothing could raise my shrimp-with-rice dish above the bland.
Everyone murmured thanks. After all the work I had done, however,
nothing less than a standing ovation could satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   The next day's lunch was another couple's turn. After a lazy
morning, the wife sauntered into the kitchen saying she would make
use of leftovers. I followed her into the kitchen to see if we
should telephone for restaurant reservations, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   But she swiftly transformed the remains from my meal, flavoring
the rice and shrimp with a little cumin from an ancient bottle on
the shelf. She chopped up scallions, julienned some red peppers,
stuffed it all into a couple of avocados, and topped it with a
vinaigrette enlivened with the pulp of a tomato that had been
hiding in the back of the refrigerator. A few chopped cocktail
peanuts finished off the dish.
</P>
<P>
   She, of course, got the applause that I had suffered for. How
did she do it, we asked. ``I just listen to what the food tells me
to do,'' she said. That was when I decided that I, too, would learn
to cook without recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But where to begin? The French are apparently born with
knowledge of the proper ratio of vinegar to wine that is needed for
a beurre blanc. It is not unusual for an Italian family to have its
own long-cherished way of making Bolognese sauce. But we don't have
a central cuisine in the United States, or a code of cooking passed
from one generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why we have such an extraordinary culture
of cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   We really need them. They beckon us to try the newest fads,
telling us that we, too, can be wonderful cooks. And sometimes they
are right. But as a consequence, we have become recipe-bound. And
cookbook dependence leads only to neurotic need, fear of recipe
abandonment, and worse _ the compulsion to prepare the same foods
over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   So when I decided to throw away my recipes, I had no idea of
what to put in their place. My first experiment took place when my
husband and I returned home from the movies starving, and he
suggested a fast call for a pizza delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Like that woman at the beach, I told him that the leftovers
would tell me what I should do. I rustled up a pasta sauce from
some zucchini and spinach, and set out two bowls. One bite
convinced us that this was why takeout was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly I needed help. But where would I get it? I began by
hanging out with my more food-savvy friends, shopping with them and
spending time in their kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to classes, I found a particularly helpful one that
emphasized French techniques. The teacher, unlike many of the
others with whom I had studied, refused to give us recipes.
Instead, he demonstrated dishes, seldom using measuring utensils,
and insisted that we write down our impressions and recreate his
dishes at home.
</P>
<P>
   At first, this was infuriating. But I was learning basic
principles. Just like a good college student, I kept a notebook of
my discoveries. At first they were quite simple. For a flavorful
stock, for example, use twice as many onions as carrots, and twice
as many carrots as celery.
</P>
<P>
   And I made note of those flavor combinations that were
apparently made in heaven and will never let you down: roasted red
peppers and goat cheese; chilies and cilantro; mushrooms and
potatoes. Eventually I began to make lists of flavors that I loved
and longed to find uses for: cardamom, star anise, pumpkin seeds.
</P>
<P>
   At that point I returned to my cookbooks, now using them in a
different way. I began setting them out side by side, comparing
recipes for similar dishes and taking note of common elements and
proportions. I would look at an Italian risotto dish next to an
Indian biryani, and then use some of one to make the other. I would
see if coconut could be substituted in a cream sauce. I would try
out standard crepe fillings in tamales.
</P>
<P>
   Last year I once again found myself sharing a vacation rental
house. Once again it was time to put together a meal.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a difference. I would do it without spending a
sunny day under the fluorescent lights of the local superstore. I
took stock of what was already in the larder. There was an
abundance of crisp apples and some pecans. A previous visitor had
left behind a bottle of balsamic vinegar. Lots of broccoli was
hanging about, as well as a few greens, potatoes and onions. There
was no Cuisinart, and no decent knives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I had changed. I now found these limitations exhilarating.
The salad became one of toasted nuts atop apples and endive with a
honey mustard vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   For the soup base? Onions and garlic sauteed in a little olive
oil and flavored with dried thyme and cayenne. I chopped up the
broccoli and potatoes, and simmered them with onions and garlic in
water and wine. Margarine and a little skim milk, plus a fistful of
Parmesan, became a soup-thickening bechamel, made tasty with a few
shakes from an old jar of nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   The meal was gobbled up. And this time I got my vacation day at
the beach house and an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great moment, but one that took a while to arrive at.
If you are new to cooking, it is important not to be too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Start with one useful and adaptable dish, and explore it
thoroughly. Limit yourself to cookbooks by masters of particular
cuisines. Some of my favorites are ``The Fine Art of Italian
Cooking'' by Giuliano Bugialli, ``Classic Indian Cooking'' by Julie
Sahni, and anything by Julia Child. The cuisines are vastly
different, but these books emphasize basic techniques and master
recipes _ which allowed me to cut loose while remaining grounded.)
</P>
<P>
   Tomato sauce is a wonderful dish to begin with because it is so
tasty yet is such a utility player, able to go from a soup to a
pasta topping. Compare different recipes, and cook them all. Don't
be afraid of boring anyone. The people you are feeding will likely
enjoy the chance to explore along with you. Write down what you
thought of the amount of onion in one dish, the hint of basil in
another, the thickness of a third.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using what you have learned, play with small, safe
variations. How would it be with rosemary? What would happen if you
threw in some chopped olives? Or mushrooms? Move on to another
solid master recipe, such as vichyssoise soup, and proceed the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   As you work your way through your experiments, you will not only
be eating some decent meals and getting used to the kitchen but you
will also be developing your senses _ just as musicians get to know
chord progressions and key changes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Cooks who are more experienced might want to try bolder
variations of the dishes with which they are most comfortable.
Instead of mashed potatoes, try a chestnut puree with a dash of
Calvados, or sweet potatoes with ginger. On a wintry day, leave
that ham bone and butter out of your split pea soup, and make a
health-conscious meatless potage seasoned with cumin and curry.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you will have flops if you cook without recipes. My biggest
fiasco was a bit of pesto derangement. I ground peanuts and
macadamia nuts with cilantro, lemongrass and jalapenos, and placed
my creation on top of linguine. Hello, fusion food from purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   But these days I have fewer disasters than I did when I was
recipe-dependent. When you learn to cook without recipes, you
develop not just your skills but also your common sense and your
ability to capitalize on what you would have previously considered
to be mistakes (although my peanut pesto refused to be
rehabilitated).
</P>
<P>
   Freeing yourself from recipes is likely to open up your
relationship to food. You will be able to express the bounty of the
season and the region. Last summer an impossibly sultry day
inspired a mango gazpacho. A recent trip to the Union Square
Greenmarket in New York on the first autumnal morning resulted in a
gratin of portobello mushrooms and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant you will find yourself figuring out how to
recreate at home that halibut with the trendy beet sauce for a
fraction of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Creating meals this way has opened up a sensual world of
memories and associations for me. Sometimes I will cook out of
homesickness for the Mexican and Asian influences of my native town
of Santa Barbara, Calif. I will put together tuna burgers with
wasabi, or an Alfredo sauce with chipotles, and the flavors will
carry me home for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I have even started dreaming about dishes I want to
create. One was an apple and beet soup laced with orange peel and
fresh mint. It turned out to taste as good in reality as it did in
sleepyland.
</P>
<P>
   Have I truly thrown away my cookbooks? Absolutely not. I collect
them now more avidly than ever and use them for suggestions and
ideas. These days my cookbooks talk to me. They don't order me
around.

A FRENCH GIN ASSERTS ITSELF AND LEAVES OUT LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   French gin? Mais oui. After all, the word itself is English
shorthand for genievre, the French word for juniper berry, which is
the dominant flavor in all gins. And if anyone needs historical
precedents, Alexandre Gabriel and Jean-Dominique Andreu _ the young
French hotshots behind Pierre Ferrand Cognac, Daron Calvados and
Cerbois Armagnac _ have a dossier full of them, compiled during
research expeditions in the Netherlands and northern France.
</P>
<P>
   It is the evidence in the glass, however, that makes the case
best. Citadelle, named in honor of an 18th-century distillery once
situated in Dunkirk's historic fort, is a crisp, full-bodied gin,
florid and assertive, even insolent.
</P>
<P>
   In historical terms, it represents a slap in the face to the
understated, recessive style known as London dry. The dominant note
is juniper, of course, with a citric snap from orange and lemon
peels, but the plot thickens very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel and Andreu, working from archives in Dunkirk and using
old-fashioned pot stills, set out to reproduce the full-flavored,
mouth-filling gin that Dunkirk's distillers shipped to England 200
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are 19 botanicals in the mix. Some of them, like licorice,
angelica and coriander, are often found in other gins. Others are
exotic, like cubeb, cardamom, cumin, violet root and grains of
paradise, a peppery West African berry.
</P>
<P>
   The team effort combines to produce a highly complex, deep gin
with floral, spicy and even earthy undertones. A bottle is about
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Now all it needs is a cocktail. But why shouldn't a commanding
personality with a name like Citadelle simply take one over? Armed
with an olive or a lemon twist, it can storm the martini and win it
for France. Behold the martinet.

COURT RULES BUSINESS GUESTS HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION
AGAINST POLICE SEARCHES WHILE IN ANOTHER'S HOME 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that business
guests, such as insurance salesmen or cosmetics dealers, enjoy no
constitutional protection against unreasonable police searches
while in someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the justices said people who enter another
person's house solely to ply their trade inside have no
``reasonable expectation of privacy'' entitling them to the Fourth
Amendment's safeguard against unwarranted searches. By contrast,
the justices, also by a 5-4 margin, indicated in their various
opinions that temporary social guests, such as friends who come for
lunch, would be constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the high court reinstated the drug convictions of
two men whom a police officer, while peering through a window
without a search warrant, saw bagging cocaine in another person's
apartment. The Minnesota Supreme Court had thrown out the
convictions, ruling that Eagan, Minn., police Officer James Thielen
violated Wayne Thomas Carter's and Melvin Johns' Fourth Amendment
rights by conducting a warrantless search of Kimberly Thompson's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Minnesota counterpart,
saying Carter and Johns were merely business visitors who lacked
the expectation of privacy _ and constitutional protection _ of a
home owner or overnight guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no suggestion that they had a previous relationship
with Thompson, or that there was any other purpose to their visit''
besides business, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the
5-4 majority. ``While the apartment was a dwelling place for
Thompson, it was for these respondents (Carter and Johns) simply a
place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was joined in his opinion by Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota prosecutor who argued the case hailed the decision
as a victory for law enforcement. However, the American Civil
Liberties Union called the ruling ``disappointing but not
surprising'' in light of the Supreme Court's recent narrowing of
Fourth Amendment protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news for the protection of public safety in
America,'' said Dakota County, Minn., attorney James Backstrom.
``It's good news for keeping our communities safe from drug dealers
and others involved in the commission of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Shapiro, the ACLU's national legal director, said the
high court misread the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a court that has not generally been responsive
to Fourth Amendment claims,'' he said. ``I think the court's view
of privacy in this case runs contrary to the expectation of most
Americans, who assume when they are invited guests in someone's
home they will not be subject to government snooping.''
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg assailed the
court for its narrow reading of the Fourth Amendment. She said the
decision will hurt home owners and renters who, while entertaining
business guests, will have no protection against police
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, when a home owner or lessor personally invites a
guest into her home to share in a common endeavor, whether it be
for conversation, to engage in leisure activities, or for business
purposes licit or illicit, that guest should share his host's
shelter against unreasonable searches and seizures,'' Ginsburg
wrote. ``As I see it, people are not genuinely secure in their
(homes) against unreasonable searches and seizures if their
invitations to others increase the risk of unwarranted governmental
peering and prying into their dwelling places.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter joined Ginsburg's
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer agreed with Ginsburg that the Fourth
Amendment should be interpreted broadly to include business and
social guests. But Breyer voted with the majority in reinstating
the drug convictions, saying the police officer did not need a
warrant before he observed Carter and Johns through partially open
Venetian blinds while standing in a public place.
</P>
<P>
   Any person in the same area as the officer could have seen
Carter and Johns, Breyer said, intimating that the two men should
have taken greater care in closing the blinds to guard their
privacy. ``One who lives in a basement apartment that fronts a
publicly traveled street, or similar space, ordinarily understands
the need for care lest a member of the public simply direct his
gaze downward,'' Breyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, agreed with the dissenters
that the Fourth Amendment protects social guests, who, he said,
generally have ``a legitimate expectation of privacy, and hence
protection against searches in their host's home.'' However,
Kennedy reiterated the majority's view that business visitors do
not enjoy constitutional protection.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, in a concurring opinion that Thomas joined, said the
Fourth Amendment protection in the home applies only to owners,
renters or overnight guests, who have taken ``temporary residence''
in another person's house. &QL;

THE ROAD TO COOKBOOK INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: WITHOUT-RECIPES)  
 (HLW)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you feel you have become a slave to Julia or Jacques, don't
abandon your recipes all at once. And remember: the road to freedom
begins with a familiar dish.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a favorite recipe, one you have enjoyed preparing, and
think about how you might vary it by substituting ingredients or
changing the proportions. (Do not try this, however, with cake or
pastry; baking without following a formula is only for experts.)
</P>
<P>
   To start a stew or casserole, for example, fresh fennel could
replace celery. If you like the direction the flavor has taken, you
could intensify it by adding a few fennel seeds or a splash of
Pernod, or even some fresh tarragon, which also imparts a subtle
note of licorice.
</P>
<P>
   Some tomato puree can enrich a sauce that previously called for
just chicken stock. Does the market have beautiful bunches of Swiss
chard? They might be used in a dish designed for spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to liberate yourself is to improvise with leftovers.
Turn a stew into a soup by cutting the meat into smaller pieces and
adding more broth and perhaps a starch, like cooked rice or
noodles. Consider turning a vegetable dish, like sauteed mushrooms,
into a pasta sauce. Use leftovers in a salad, topping greens with
cold pieces of grilled meat or fish. Or dress yesterday's starch,
like rice or pasta, with a sauce, which can then be baked to make a
casserole. Top it with bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other pointers to help you wing it:
</P>
<P>
   Always keep texture in mind when varying recipes or improvising.
The texture of the ingredients, not the taste, is what affects how
they cook. For example, to replace meaty fresh tuna, best served
rare, you need a fish with similar density, like swordfish, rather
than a more delicate flaky sea bass, which should be cooked more
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Taste and check seasonings as you go, but allow food that has
been simmering to cool down for a minute before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Do not hesitate to add a little salt _ sea salt is best _ to
bring out flavor. More salt is first aid for many recipes. If you
detect bitterness in a dish from an ingredient like mushrooms or
radicchio, salting tends to cancel it out. (About the only way to
modify heavy oversalting is to add starch, like potatoes.)
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of lemon juice can also work wonders to correct a
sauce, even one that may be slightly oversalted. Similarly, a bit
of butter or oil swirled into a sauce just before serving will add
a gloss and richness far beyond its measure.
</P>
<P>
   If a sauce is too thin, cooking it longer, uncovered, will
concentrate it. And if you are afraid of overcooking the main
ingredient, drain off the sauce, cook it down separately, then
recombine the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Introduce new seasonings one at a time, in small increments,
until you like the flavor. And when dining out, think about how you
might reseason or otherwise improve a dish you ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The internal temperature for rare, medium and well-done is the
same for all meats, game and poultry. Keep an instant-read
thermometer on hand for testing. But beware the guidelines that say
140 degrees is rare. It is not. Meat is rare at 120 degrees but it
is still risky at that temperature because all possible pathogens
are not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce liquid, sear meats or brown a casserole, do not be
afraid of high heat on top of the stove or in the oven. A few
minutes on a hot grill or broiler flame is the only way to burnish
fish fillets without overcooking them. But keep watch carefully.
Conversely, if you want melting tenderness, a slow simmer is best.
</P>
<P>
   As for quantity, measure. If you are not sure you have made
enough soup for six, spoon some from the pot into a bowl, calculate
how much you need, and add more ingredients if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Do not rush things. When you are cooking on your own, you will
need the time to experiment or repair a flat taste. Indeed, soups
and stews are usually better when prepared a day in advance and
reheated.
</P>
<P>
   And then, if all else fails, there is always another basic rule
to remember: adding bacon or chocolate will improve any dish.

   CALIFORNIA -- ARMED. Sen. Mary Landrieu was appointed Tuesday to
the Senate Armed Services Committee, signaling Landrieu's elevation
of defense interests over agriculture, at least in the short run.
Defense issues, such as terrorism and local spending items, figure
to play a more prominent role in Congress during the next two
years, congressional experts say. Stricherz

   COLORADO -- CLOUT (3-story package). In Congress, size matters
and time counts. With 435 members and a strict system of seniority,
the House of Representatives demands that congressmen band together
and use their years of clout whenever possible -- that is, if they
want to pass national legislation or work on local issues, such as
securing funding for roads, universities or federal buildings.
That's why the Colorado delegation has been scrambling to make up
for the loss of seniority when long-time Reps. Dan Schaefer,
R-Lakewood, and David Skaggs, D-Boulder, retire from office next
year. Three stories: one on the clout issue, one on Skaggs and one
on Schaefer. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- VIDEO. While the video game industry has created
an effective ratings system, children still have too much access to
``ultra-violent'' games, said Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.,
and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., at a Washington press conference with the
National Institute on Media and the Family. Story will include part
of the institute's list of kid-appropriate games and those that are
too violent. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN -- HOEKSTRA. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Holland, said
Attorney General Janet Reno should appoint an independent counsel
to investigate whether Harold Ickes, a former deputy White House
chief of staff, lied to a congressional panel last year. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY -- DSCC. Moving up a step among Senate Democrats,
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., Tuesday assumed the leadership
of the political committee charged with returning Democrats to the
majority in the 2000 elections. Kane
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- GEKAS. Rep. George Gekas, R-Harrisburg, voted
along with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to expand
the impeachment investigation of President Clinton to include
campaign finance. The committee voted to issue subpoenas seeking
campaign finance documents. (Brief.) Fine
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA -- PARSONS. It's especially critical for leaders
to always tell the truth, former University of South Carolina
women's basketball coach Pam Parsons said Tuesday to the
congressional committee considering impeaching President Clinton.

   TEXAS -- PRISONS. After four days on the lam, Martin Gurule is
so far an exception -- escape from death row is rare and almost
never successful. (Possible.) Brown

   WISCONSIN -- KOHL-VIDEO. Sens. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., released their annual report card on the video
games rating system at a press conference Tuesday. The senators
praised the video game industry for developing a comprehensive
ratings system, but said there was still a long way to go before

Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said his focus on keeping spending

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aasif Mandvi does not need to go to the gym anymore.
He has been losing weight just by performing night after night at
the American Place Theater.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Mandvi's one-man show, ``Sakina's Restaurant,''
is not about one man. It is about Azgi, a young man who leaves
India to work in an Indian restaurant in Manhattan. It is about
Hakim, the restaurant's proprietor, who is struggling to raise two
children in America and run a successful business on East Sixth
Street. It is about Farrida, Hakim's wife, who feels isolated and
misses home; Sakina, Hakim's teen-age daughter, who is pulled
between conformity and rebellion; Samir, Sakina's younger brother,
who is trying to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of a scarf or a telephone, Mandvi alternately
inhabits each of these characters. They populate his play, which
was highly praised by critics when it opened last summer. ``While
the characters are living through the Indian immigrant
experience,'' Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times, the play's
``revelations apply to anyone who feels the pull of two cultures
and to a thousand variations on a loss of innocence.'' Variety
called Mandvi ``a likable and arresting storyteller who seasons his
tale with a warming, infectious smile and an eagerness to please.''
</P>
<P>
   One-man plays that plumb personal ethnic experience are no
longer novel. Two of the genre's most successful artists started
out at the American Place Theater: Eric Bogosian, with his 1986
play, ``Drinking in America,'' and John Leguizamo, whose show
``Freak,'' moved to Broadway last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandvi's is perhaps the first in New York to explore the
experience of South Asians. And some of the city's Indians say they
are grateful for it. ``I could see so many of my friends' children
in those kids,'' said Aroon Shivdasani of the Indo-American Arts
Council, a new nonprofit group that tries to promote Indian
artists. ``It was really well done. You came out smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandvi, 32, was born in Bombay, grew up in England and moved to
the United States 16 years ago. In writing his play, he said, he
purposely tried to move beyond old stereotypes, to convey the
specific trials of Indian immigrants, as well as the universal
experience of outsiderness. ``I am an immigrant; I am the son of
immigrants,'' Mandvi said. ``I am on that fence, and that's what my
show is about.'' In developing the characters in his play, Mandvi
said, he drew largely on his own family. His own father is named
Hakim; Sakina has many of the personality quirks of his younger
sister; the young boy is based on Mandvi's sense of himself as a
child. ``Most of it is me,'' he said. ``They're all alter egos in
some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandvi said he took his parents' experience as immigrants and
put words to feelings they may not have been able to express. ``I
asked myself the question, `What would my parents say, and what
would they reveal about themselves if they had the insight and
capacity to do that?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents finally saw the play, Mandvi said they were
surprised to see him playing them. ``My mother had no words
really,'' he said. ``To see her own son portraying her as a young
woman when I wasn't even born yet was strange. My dad I think was
flattered that I've immortalized him in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of shaping these specific characters has made
Mandvi less tolerant of stereotypes. As a fledgling actor, he has
played his share of Indian cab drivers. Now that he has an agent
and has appeared in a few plays, movies and television shows,
Mandvi said he feels he can be more selective about what roles he
accepts.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Americans are simply not writing
multidimensional roles for Indians. That is part of what inspired
him to write. He began working on the material in ``Sakina's
Restaurant'' in his stand-up comedy act in late 1991, having turned
to comedy because he was not getting roles as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard about Wynn Handman, the artistic director of the
American Place Theater, as the person who gave Bogosian and
Leguizamo their starts. Mandvi auditioned for Handman's acting
class and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started bringing in these characters,'' Handman said. ``I
always felt, `When it's really ready, I'm going to do it at
American Place.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, Mandvi developed the play. He met Kim
Hughes, another of Handman's students, while he was on a catering
job, and she became his director. They did various workshop
productions of the play in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really wanted to do it,'' Mandvi said. ``They felt the
subject matter was too specific and wouldn't find an audience. They
didn't see it as universal.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mandvi's acting career made some progress. He got
parts in ``Suburbia,'' at the Lincoln Center Theater in 1993, and
in ``Death Defying Acts'' at the Variety Arts Theater in 1995. He
also got a few small parts in films and television shows. Last year
he helped start a sketch comedy group called the Associates that
has developed something of a following.
</P>
<P>
   Mandvi was not impatient. After attending the University of
South Florida on a theater scholarship, his first job was playing
Hollywood characters at Disney MGM Studios. He said he came to New
York ``to stand on line'' like everybody else, and he continues to
commute into Manhattan from an apartment in Long Island City,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in January, 1997, he performed ``Sakina's Restaurant''
at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida and, a few days
later, at the New York Theater Workshop. That's when Handman
decided the show was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I want to do it,''' Mandvi recalled. ``It was like a
dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The long road was not yet over. Mandvi said he and and Handman
spent the next year raising money from the Indian community,
corporate sponsors, board members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The play opened in June and is scheduled to run through the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aasif combines a keen intelligence and the ability to create
varied characters with great specificity,'' Handman said. ``So
there are nuances that are quite astonishing when he's doing six
characters at one time.''

`TIBET: THROUGH THE RED BOX' _ ONCE UPON A TIME IN A LAND OF
WONDER
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing you will notice about ``Tibet: Through the Red
Box,'' by the Czech-born artist Peter Sis, is the haunting beauty
of Sis' illustrations. We see labyrinths and landscapes of sere
beauty and mystery, the fabulous Potala Palace in Prague, Buddhist
mandalas and several views of a quiet study in Prague saturated in
night shade. These arresting and luscious drawings so dominate the
book that you almost fail to notice the text that they accompany,
but there is a text, almost an incantation, whose motif is a
child's wide-eyed rumination on the magical and strange stories of
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Here, from what one gathers from the text, is the story: In
1954, when Peter Sis was a small boy growing up in Soviet-dominated
Prague, his father, Vladimir, a filmmaker, left for Beijing to
teach filmmaking to Chinese students. From Beijing, Vladimir went
to Tibet with his students to make a documentary of a road-building
project through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, a landslide separated him from his Chinese
hosts, and he became lost in Tibet. After some wandering, he found
his way to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, where he met with the Dalai
Lama, then 19, and warned him of the invasion of his country being
engineered by Maoist China. Then a year late Vladimir returned to
Prague and to Peter and his family with a small red box in which he
kept a diary of his sojourn in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Peter, a successful writer and illustrator of
children's books living in New York, is summoned back to Prague by
his father. There Peter opens the red box, kept closed for all of
those years, and reads his father's diary. ``It's like an ancient
anthill or a grave of memories buried in the sweet smell of honey,
rosin and sandalwood,'' he writes, and then embarks on the slender
and mystical volume he has put before us.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a man stranded for a year in Tibet in 1954 and of a
faraway son who wonders about his fate is, quite simply, fabulously
rich in possibilities. ``Tibet: Through the Red Box'' is in this
sense a charming book and a visually beautiful one, but it is also
precious and unsatisfyingly cryptic. In appearance and textual
style it is a children's book, but it requires a good deal more
knowledge of political matters _ the Communist takeover of
Czechoslovakia, for example, and the Chinese invasion of Tibet _
for it to be fully grasped by children.
</P>
<P>
   The book is partly Sis' memoir of his father and partly an
imaginative (rather than historically real) evocation of a Tibet
that despite his father's warnings was invaded and transformed by
China. It is also a somber recollection and transformation into
images and words a childhood made sad by a father's unexplained
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is too childlike in tone and structure to
engage the adult mind even while its adult themes are not for
children. Sis' voice is intentionally naive and his story an
enchanted-forest tale, but it is one thing to be poetic and
philosophically suggestive and another to develop themes and
characters about which and whom we would like to know more. Indeed,
Sis' story is so promising that one wishes he had told it more
fully, even straightforwardly, rather than engage in all that
artifice, enticing us with fragments, lavishly decorated hints.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, my father is calling me home,'' is the
way Sis begins his tale. These opening lines are placed between two
marvelous drawings of a boy holding a satchel and returning down an
ancient cobblestone path to home, where the red box glows on a desk
in an upstairs room. What we do not know from the book, but learn
from interviews that Sis has given, is that his summons to Prague
came when his father fell ill with prostate cancer. The box itself
was kept closed all these years because his father, who is still
alive, was concerned that it could get him into trouble with
Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities, which is another detail we
know from interviews, not the book itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I unlock the box with a rusty little key,'' Sis continues, and
then unfolds the enigmatic fable of his father. The story includes
his becoming separated from the road-building team and some hints
of severe hardship, like getting lost in a snowstorm. It also
includes more fabulist matters: a boy dressed in red and wearing
bells who suddenly appears in a giant rhododendron forest and
inexplicably delivers a letter to the elder Sis from Prague; an
eight-foot-tall giant who takes him food in a cave; fish that have
human faces swimming in a turquoise lake.
</P>
<P>
   The fabulist elements seem symbolic of a Tibet that is about to
be altered forever by entirely nonfabulist Communist Chinese. But
Sis' more intense concern is the role that the red box always
played for him: a source of wonderment and puzzlement of a lifelong
curiosity about Tibet and the father who got lost there and,
perhaps, out of fear and hardship, allowed his imagination free
rein. So did Sis the younger, and we are beneficiaries of that,
even as he whets but does not satisfy our curiosity.

`THE LAND IS WHITE, THE SEED IS BLACK': MEMORIES OF MISERY UNDER
APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of Koto Bolofo's quietly moving documentary, ``The
Land Is White, the Seed Is Black,'' stands the filmmaker's father,
a black South African teacher who tells a familiar story of
persecution under apartheid followed by exile in England where he
lived with his family for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to South Africa in 1994 after Nelson Mandela was
elected president, he discovered that his family's land had been
confiscated and its house destroyed. The tale of his flight,
narrated in a soft, deliberate voice while standing beside the
rusted hulk of his old abandoned car, may be familiar, but it is
still a true horror story, worthy of Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Double-billed with this short black-and-white movie, which opens
Wednesday in New York City, is ``African Violet,'' a short, more
elliptical and elegant color film by the same director that evokes
the pressures and fantasies surrounding apartheid as experienced
through the eyes of five (mostly white) South African women during
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Although both films use overlapping voices, dissolving images
and still photographs, ``African Violet'' is a full-blown cinematic
collage in which excerpts from George Orwell's ``1984,'' read
aloud, take on an ugly new resonance when juxtaposed with pictures
of an icy white South African matron preparing a formal tea party
or with the fantasy of a woman confessing her sadistic feelings
toward a servant whom she admits she increasingly enjoys hurting
and humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   If ``African Violet'' is the bolder of the two films, ``The Land
Is White, the Seed Is Black'' is the more powerful. In sparse
language, choosing his words carefully, the filmmaker's father
recalls being relocated from his homeland to a place where all the
trees had to be chopped down for firewood.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was accused of being a Communist and dismissed from his
teaching job after his students discovered Karl Marx's famous
admonition for the workers of the world to unite in a
government-authorized history textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing to his homeland in the British colony of Basutoland
(which is now Lesotho), he found himself still pursued by racist
agents of the South African government, and his house was literally
burned down around him. Even after being welcomed in Zambia, he was
hounded out of the African continent by the same white South
African agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Land Is White, the Seed is Black'' would be just another
grim personal testament of racist inhumanity were it not fitted
into a broader cinematic design.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven with the teacher's reminiscences are still
photographs, overlapping voices, a stirring excerpt from a speech
by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a voice-over radio play
in which a woman waits with her children for her husband to return
for dinner hoping he will bring them some meat.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of pictures presents an impressionistic view of rural
village life under apartheid. While the filmmaker's father talks
about his lifelong struggle to combat the systematic ``mental
starvation'' of black South Africans, many of these images
illustrate the struggle to avoid physical starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``African Violet'' is best appreciated as a kind of ominous
photo essay conjuring a repressive social atmosphere in which white
women live in terror of rape and where the incendiary crosscurrents
of racial and sexual domination and submission create a dynamic of
latent sadomasochism.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a fly landing on a piece of pastry or of a spilled
pitcher of rose-colored punch can produce instant thoughts of
despoliation and bloodshed. ``African Violet'' depicts an entire
culture existing in a state of high anxiety.  &QL;

SPIRITUALLY MINDED CHILDREN'S BOOKS OFFER THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Different parents start with different books. In my case, it
began with Robert Munsch's ``Love You Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a precious baby boy _ is there any other kind?
_ and a stubborn mother. As the pages turn, the boy turns, too.
Into a mischievous toddler, a muddy boy, a limits-testing teen-ager
_ is there any other kind? But there's that mom ... still sneaking
into his bedroom to watch him sleep, to rock him back and forth,
back and forth, until she's too old to sing anymore, too old to
rock that 30-year-old man with a newborn daughter of his own. I'm
generally in tears by page 10. Over the years my oldest daughter
has learned to pick up reading where I trail off.
</P>
<P>
   There's another tenacious mother in Margaret Wise Brown's ``The
Runaway Bunny.'' And tenacity pays off in Dr. Seuss' ``Oh, the
Places You'll Go,'' too. These are picture books in the traditional
sense (easy words), but they tackle difficult concepts (life,
death, career traps).
</P>
<P>
   That's what good books do: teach. Some teaching books for
children can be described as religious in nature, and they relay
important Bible stories in words our kids can understand. Some,
like the ones above, aren't strictly religious, but can still be
defined as spiritual, tackling topics like discrimination and the
cycle of life and death. They explain the need for sharing,
understanding thy neighbor, and being kind in unkind situations. In
these books, the gentle guy gets the world.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought to teach my children from my own mistakes.
Instead, I read them books. And sometimes, at the end of a trying
day, that's enough for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the best books I've found that introduce big
subjects to little readers.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Molly's Pilgrim'' by Barbara Cohen (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shephard
Books, $15). In this 1983 classic, which has been reprinted, Molly,
a modern-day pilgrim, teaches her classmates the meaning of
Thanksgiving. The story is based on a true story of the author's
Russian immigrant family.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Tale of Three Trees,'' a traditional folk tale, re-told
by Angela Elwell Hunt (Lion Publishing, $14.99). Three little trees
grow side by side, each dreaming of a glorious future. One wants to
hold treasure, the second wants to be a mighty ship, and the third
wants to remind people of the power of God. Their wishes come true
_ in ways that will surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When the World Was New'' by L.J. Sattgast (Gold 'N' Honey
Books, $13.99). The Creation story is told in rhyming text for
children who are just learning to read and who will sing along with
you until Day Seven _ when everybody takes a rest.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Go Away, Dark Night'' by Liz Curtis Higgs (Waterbrook Press,
$14.95). Dedicated to ``anyone who has ever been afraid,'' this
book tells the story of Griffin, the boy who dreaded bedtime. A
reassuring read for the preschool set _ a must for any parent who
has ever performed a closet check ... twice.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Just in Case You Ever Wonder'' by Max Lucado (Word
Publishing, $14.99). In simple words, this San Antonio-based writer
shares the promises he has made his three daughters. Among them:
``I'll always love you. I'll always hug you. I'll always be on your
side.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mary's Treasure Box'' by Carolyn Walz Kramlich (Thomas
Nelson Inc., $12.99) and ``Mary, Did You Know?'' by Mark Lowry
(Waterbrook Press, $14.95). Two unconventional and enchanting
versions of the Christmas story.
</P>
<P>
   The following two books are suggestions from Sandy Wade,
director of religious education at St. Christopher's Episcopal
Church in Fort Worth:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Little Book of Prayers,'' selected by Caroline Walsh
(Kingfisher Books, paperback, $8.95). Simple yet profound lines
from the likes of Robert Browning, Ogden Nash and Mother Teresa,
along with traditional prayers.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Kids' Random Acts of Kindness'' (Conari Press, $8.95). This
book is small and square, but its concept is anything but. It's
prefaced by this little story that sold me.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little girl was late getting home from school and her mother
began to scold her, but then she stopped and asked, `Why are you so
late?'
</P>
<P>
   `I had to help another girl. She was in trouble,' explained the
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   `What did you do?' the mother asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I sat down and helped her cry.'''

EARLY START FOR THE TATE'S NEW MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several hundred people gathered recently on the south side of
the Thames River in London, around the hulking facade of a former
power station where Andy Warhol's 1964 film ``Empire'' was being
projected larger than life. Joggers stopped to watch. So did
neighbors on their way home from work, cyclists, film buffs and
hordes of contemporary-art mavens who had read about the free
screening.
</P>
<P>
   Call it curiosity or a cult happening or simply going to the
party 18 months early, but the site of the new Tate Gallery of
Modern Art, which is scheduled to open in 2000, is already becoming
part of the fabric of London's cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   Before the museum opens, there will be a program of
site-specific art installations around the power station and a
series of screenings of other films by popular contemporary artists
like Chris Burden, Gordon Matta-Clark, Julian Opie and Richard
Serra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the public used to going here and making people
aware of our existence,'' said Nicholas Serota, director of the
Tate Gallery and all its branches, of which the new museum is one.
``It's also about beginning to build links with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated at Bankside just opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, the new
$208 million Tate _ the first new national museum to be built in
Britain in 100 years and the first national museum in London
devoted solely to modern art _ is the biggest news in the London
art world for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement is also being felt in the United States, where
collectors _ like John and Frances Bowes of San Francisco, Donald
Bryant of St. Louis and Douglas Cramer of New York _ have already
agreed to give their support to the new Tate. So has the Annenberg
Foundation. These supporters ``tend to be people or institutions
whose principal commitment is to their local museums but who want
to be a part of this project,'' Serota said.
</P>
<P>
   Bankside, which has been one of London's most neglected areas,
not only is about to get a face lift but also is poised to become a
major cultural center. In addition to the Tate, the Globe Theater,
a $48 million re-creation of the original Shakespeare theater,
opened in the neighborhood last year and has received wide acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and the new Tate have prompted a host of other
projects. A new $27 million pedestrian bridge _ designed by Sir
Norman Foster, the London architect; Sir Anthony Caro, the
sculptor, and Ove Arup and Partners, an engineering firm _ will
link Bankside to St. Paul's.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a new subway station, designed by Richard
McCormick, a leading British architect, and a new apartment
development called Manhattan Lofts, as well as scores of new shops
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   An economic-development study prepared for the Tate estimates
that the new museum will attract about 2 million visitors a year,
create 2,400 jobs and provide direct economic benefits to London of
$48 million to $144 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A modern-art museum in London will add strength to an already
vibrant contemporary-art scene, where young British artists like
Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Waring and Douglas Gordon
are becoming internationally known. ``We have been experiencing
huge audiences when we show contemporary art,'' Serota said.
``There is certainly no shortage of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lars Nittve, who was appointed director of the new museum last
spring after having been director of the Louisiana Museum of Modern
Art near Copenhagen, Denmark, for three years, said it was not by
chance that the new Tate was being built now. ``There's a greater
self-confidence and international recognition among contemporary
British artists,'' he said. ``And this museum will surely trigger
more changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nittve and Serota envision the new museum as a serious rival to
both the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Pompidou Center
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate are already
joining forces to share shows even before the Tate opens. The
Jackson Pollock exhibition that opened last month at the Modern is
traveling to the Tate after it leaves New York on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot in common,'' said Glenn Lowry, director of the
Modern. ``It makes sense to collaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   London's art dealers and auction houses hope the new Tate will
attract more art buyers to London. London has been steadily losing
business to New York for the last two years because of rising
European Union import taxes and is in danger of losing even more
when the Paris auction market opens up to non-French auctioneers in
the future.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Finding Success in Raising Funds
</P>
<P>
   A museum devoted to modern and contemporary art was the
brainchild of Serota, who oversees all the Tate museums: the
original in the Millbank section of London, the new museum and two
satellite institutions, the Tate St. Ives and the Tate Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   An adept fund-raiser, he has been able to attract more than $160
million for the new museum, including an award of $80 million from
the government's Millennium Commission, along with $19.2 million
from English Partnerships, a redevelopment agency.
</P>
<P>
   Serota convincingly makes the argument that London needs a
modern-art museum. Right now the Tate is able to show less than 15
percent of its permanent collection, because of lack of space.
About 60 percent of its holdings will be on display once the Tate
Gallery of Modern Art opens.
</P>
<P>
   A museum for modern art also gives Serota the chance to refocus
the original site at Millbank, which will become the Tate Gallery
of British Art, offering works from 1500 to the present. The Tate
Gallery of Modern Art will concentrate on British and international
art since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But with an eye toward keeping its Millbank site an attraction
for the young museum goer as well as the old, Serota has decided to
keep the annual Turner Prize exhibition _ a much-talked-about show
of the work of the finalists chosen for the coveted $32,000 prize
awarded annually to a contemporary British artist _ at Millbank
even after the opening of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of keeping the place contemporary as well as
historic,'' Serota said. ``And that's something we very much want
to maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   (This year's winner, Chris Ofili, 30, a painter whose work
centers on issues of black culture and sexual stereotyping, was
announced at a dinner at the Tate on Tuesday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Strong Points of the Collection
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Turner Prize show, which has lured audiences to the
Tate, it has an outstanding permanent collection of British art by
masters like Turner, Constable and Bacon, in addition to its
well-produced special exhibition schedule.
</P>
<P>
   While its holdings of modern and contemporary art are a far cry
from those of an institution like the Modern in New York, which has
a classic collection of art starting in 1880, the Tate does have a
strong collection of modern and contemporary art with pockets of
strength in the work of, say, the surrealists and figures like
Bonnard, Rothko and Giacometti. It also has some outstanding
individual pieces by Picasso and Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   So Serota knows that his main tasks are to court collectors in
the hope of getting their art for the Tate, as well as to raise
money for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   He has already succeeded in snagging some important collections.
Janet de Botton, a London-based collector and Tate trustee, gave
the museum her collection of contemporary art last year. Cramer, a
trustee of the Modern who is head of its painting and sculpture
committee, also gave the Tate several works of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' Opinions on a New Site
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Tate officials looked to contemporary
artists for guidance in choosing a site for the new museum. The
officials learned that converted industrial buildings or galleries
in the beaux-arts style were preferred by artists over new
buildings because they felt their work looked best in them.
</P>
<P>
   Serota had thought of building an extension to the Tate at
Millbank, but space was limited and the planning problems became
too great. After considering various locations including sites near
the Kings Cross railway station in the South Bank section of London
and Vauxhall, just opposite Millbank, he deemed the power station
ideal, and the local council happily provided $1.6 million toward
feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was to turn a very closed building into an urban
landscape,'' said Jacques Herzog, whose Swiss architectural firm,
Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, was awarded the power-station project after an
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The original Bankside power station, built after World War II,
was an imposing five-story building designed by Sir Giles Gilbert
Scott, the architect of the Liverpool Anglican Cathedral and the
designer of London's red telephone booths.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated power station will be transformed into a
360-square-foot museum (a bit larger than the Modern in New York)
with a two-story glass structure running the length of the roof,
providing natural light for the upper galleries as well as
breathtaking views of London. The museum will be entered via a ramp
at the building's west end leading down to a covered plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Three Main Elements in the Design
</P>
<P>
   The building has been designed in three distinct elements.
Turbine Hall, a space 500 feet long, 75 feet wide and 100 feet
high, which once housed the power-station turbines, is a long
covered street intended to be the heart of the building. The old
boiler house on the river side of the building will be turned into
three floors of galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The old switch station at the rear of the building, which now
houses an electricity substation, will be transformed in the last
phase of the building's development into spaces for performance
art. There will also be space for a cafe, an auditorium and rooms
for films, seminars and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's permanent collection will be housed in three large
suites of galleries broadly arranged in chronological order. There
will also be gallery space for special exhibitions and loans. ``I
believe that galleries that are plain are the most powerful,''
Herzog said. ``But they will also be flexible to change as shows
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also about architecture that lures people inside.
``This building will be like a filter which people can walk through
in all directions,'' Herzog added. ``We want to attract people who
aren't necessarily going to the museum, to turn this once
hermetically sealed power station into an urban, totally
contemporary landscape where both art and people are embodied
within the architecture.''

`MY KNEES WERE JUMPING: REMEMBERING THE KINDERTRANSPORTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: prodution notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

<P>
   Melissa Hacker's documentary, ``My Knees Were Jumping:
Remembering the Kindertransports,'' is about the Jewish children
who were saved by emigrating to Britain (from Germany, Austria,
Poland and Czechoslovakia) 60 years ago. Since Ms. Hacker is the
daughter of one such emigre _ the costume designer Ruth Morley, an
Academy Award nominee for ``The Miracle Worker'' _ she approaches
her poignant subject matter in a particularly earnest, intimate
way.
</P>
<P>
   In this gentle documentary, Ms. Hacker's mother and others who
shared the young refugees' experience speak at length about its
impact. And they delve into their memories, sometimes in the
context of support groups or family gatherings. If the film is
narrow in range, it's also heartfelt in its search for the lasting
significance of what these children and their parents went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good life now,'' says one elderly woman. ``I have a
good husband. But I have a nightmare that I live with for the rest
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-refugees, mostly women, talk about their growing
apprehensions before leaving home, and about what one calls ``a
sense of the malice all around us.'' One aged interviewee can still
remember the anti-Semitic taunts of her Aryan schoolmates. From a
child's-eye point of view, the speakers recall the destruction
wreaked on Kristallnacht and experiences like going to school and
finding it closed. The speakers also remember how their parents
made the decision, as wrenching as Sophie's choice, to part with
their children, possibly forever, on the eve of war. Though old
newsreels show the children embarking for England without too much
obvious dismay, and with brave displays of composure from the
adults, 90 percent of these young travelers never saw their parents
again.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering England, in a film narrated by Joanne Woodward, the
speakers describe how the luckiest among them found foster homes
(Ms. Morley stayed in six of them in two years), while older
children had a more difficult time attracting help. (An English
newsreel from those days depicts the children and mentions ``the
Jewish refugee influx, which is providing the world with such a
ticklish problem.'') And they read, heartbreakingly at times, from
journals and letters describing that period. One absent father
wrote of trying to imagine his daughter as she grew up far away, in
what proved to be the last letter she ever received from him. ``The
way I plead for it, it must make a stone weep,'' Ms. Morley says,
looking over her own written pleas to see her parents again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morley dominates this affecting film as a strong, gracious
presence long before the viewer has any idea that ``My Knees Were
Jumping'' is dedicated to her memory. Now her story, and those of
others who suffered the same terrible upheaval, has been preserved
for the world to see.

TURKEY-ITALY FEUD CASTS PALL OVER SOCCER GAME  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The political feud between Turkey and Italy
hangs like a threatening cloud over an Istanbul soccer stadium
where Turkish and Italian teams are to face each other on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks are furious at Italy for its refusal to extradite to
Turkey a Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who was
arrested last month when he attempted to enter Italy with a false
passport. They have burned Italian flags, staged protests in front
of Italian diplomatic missions and called for boycotts of Italian
goods.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Italy has sought and won support from the European
Union. Italian leaders say they cannot extradite Ocalan for trial
in Turkey because Italy's Constitution forbids sending criminal
suspects to countries where they could face execution.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were running so high last week that the European soccer
federation granted an appeal by the Italian champion, Juventus, to
postpone its planned Nov. 25 match against the Turkish champion,
Galatasaray. Turkish newspapers reacted with headlines like
``Postponement Scandal!'' and ``Juventus Is Scared!''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers have cooled somewhat, but not enough for some Juventus
players. Several, including the star of this year's World Cup
competition, Zinedine Zidane, have said that they fear what awaits
the team in Istanbul and that they wish the match could be moved to
a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Galatasaray's two Romanian-born players issued a
public statement saying: ``Don't be afraid. Come, Zidane. We are
your guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these assurances, Juventus decided not to come to
Istanbul for a day of practice before the match, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will be risking our lives by going there, but
the situation will certainly not be anything normal,'' said the
Juventus goalkeeper, Angelo Peruzzi. ``We have been more or less
forced to go and play, but we are very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Turkish Soccer Federation, Haluk Ulusoy,
said he would personally welcome Juventus players at the Istanbul
airport when they arrive on Wednesday. The minister of sport, Yucel
Seckiner, said he would attend the match, and invited his Italian
counterpart to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as sports people, should not allow terrorism, the common
enemy of our nations, to tarnish the atmosphere of this match,''
Seckiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy offered to meet with his
Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz, before the match to seek ways of
reducing tensions but Yilmaz refused. ``If he wants to talk,''
Yilmaz said, ``let him come to Ankara.''
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul's major newspapers published appeals to fans on
Tuesday. ``Always remember that the slightest incident will bring
thunder from around the world,'' one paper wrote. Another published
an Italian-language banner headline on its front page that said
simply: ``Benvenuto Juventus.''
</P>
<P>
   A third said in an editorial: ``The world is watching Turkey
because of the match being played tomorrow evening. Let us
embarrass all of those who expect trouble. Let the world see the
common sense and maturity of the Turkish people.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect against incidents, the Turkish police plan a
mobilization they call ``zero-risk security'' that exceeds even
that given to visiting heads of state. Police commanders said
14,000 officers and cadets would be deployed in and around the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to leave, but we are not going calmly to play a
match which simply does not offer calm,'' said the Juventus general
manager, Luciano Moggi. ``We would like to have guarantees that we
are taking a group of young players to play a soccer match rather
than taking them into war.''

TEXAS MUSIC: LYLE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE TO LOVETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, a coterie of folk singers played a small group
of clubs on or near college campuses in Austin, Houston, College
Station, Arlington and other Texas cities.
</P>
<P>
   Their songs were studies of relationships (usually going
downhill, often extinguished entirely), mornings spent nursing
hangovers, the call of the open road, growing up in Texas, and
friends met along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Clark, Steve Fromholz, Fort Worth's own Townes Van Zandt,
Dallas' Michael Martin Murphey and the others were called
``progressive country,'' if they were called anything, and each
made some wonderfully small-scale records.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Lovett was a stringy journalism major at Texas A&AMP;M in those
days, and he listened hard. That music struck such a deep chord
with Lovett that this fall he released a two-CD set, ``Step Inside
This House,'' covering songs of Texas songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lovett is the most famous acolyte of those acoustic
mavericks, he certainly wasn't the only one. The legacy of such
performers is today's alternative country, the music of Lone Star
honky-tonkers such as Jack Ingram and Charlie Robison, and quieter
acoustic singer-songwriters such as John Gorka and David Olney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy and Townes are a huge influence on the current generation
of people in the way they wrote,'' says Peter Blackstock,
co-founder of the magazine No Depression, the alt-country bible.
``The way they approached playing music _ the `art is its own
reward' approach. The idea was playing songs you wanted to play.
And a lot of people took that to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The music was closely related to the redneck country of Willie
Nelson and Waylon Jennings. But numerous songwriters, such as
Olney, recall being impressed by the to-the-bone quality of the
lyrics, the directness of the sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   They also possessed a deep romanticism: They were singing in and
about the most mythologized state in the nation, and they seemed
like a little outlaw posse, bent on nothing more than honesty and
writing good songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They influenced how I grew up listening to music,'' says
Ingram, who went from being a solo folkie playing Deep Ellum bars
in Dallas to a well-known regional honky-tonk favorite. Like
Robison, he records for Sony's Lucky Dog imprint. ``It became a
fabric of my being. It's how they set up their songs. Guy was
writing about how he'd get through the morning after a one-night
stand _ he was writing about something that happened to him and the
emotions of a moment in his life. It was so real.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guys coming out of Austin and Houston went on to
decent, if not spectacularly popular, careers in the '80s and '90s.
Van Zandt died in 1997, but Clark, Fromholz and Murphey continue to
record and play small to medium-sized venues in the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And outside of Lovett and Robert Earl Keen, so do most of the
younger guys who followed their leads. Which suits Charlie Robison
just fine; if Guy and Townes and Steve taught him anything, it was
to do good work and not worry about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear these guys writing for themselves,'' he says.
``It was, `This is my art. I'm going to stick it out no matter
what.' The honesty of their songs was unbelievable. And their songs
were the first ones I heard that sounded like my life.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Tobacco farmers, health officials must strike
balance, meet goals
 &HT;    By Jimmy Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1985, the Carter Center brought tobacco farmers and health
groups together for the first time. As a farmer from a
tobacco-growing state, and as one who had lost family members
because of the ravages of tobacco use, I thought it was imperative
that tobacco farmers and health officials work to resolve their
conflicts through civil dialogue and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, tobacco growers and public health organizations have
been talking openly and honestly about the future of tobacco in
this country. But now tobacco companies again are exerting their
influence to stop these historic discussions.
</P>
<P>
   One tobacco company sent a letter to tobacco growers, warning
them, ``Despite the current courtship . . . by members of the
anti-smoking community, we believe that all of us have to realize
that at best, these are short-term friendships of convenience.''
One ally of the tobacco companies publicly called the cooperation
between health groups and tobacco producers ``dealing with the
devil.'' And tobacco companies helped kill a tobacco bill,
sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), that would have provided
billions of dollars in assistance to tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot let tobacco companies and their supporters interfere
with efforts to assist tobacco farmers and their communities in the
next century. Nor can we allow them to disrupt our efforts to
protect public health.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers in tobacco-producing states need to plan for the
economic future rather than merely preserve the status quo. The
interests of tobacco farmers and public health officials are
inescapably intertwined in tobacco-producing states, and these two
parties must continue talking to find mutually acceptable
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 40 agriculture and health organizations
signed a set of core principles outlining goals to both parties. I
have decided to endorse that effort by adding my name and that of
the Carter Center to this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   These principles acknowledge the need to ensure the future
economic viability of tobacco-growing communities. They include
provisions supporting:
</P>
<P>
   _ Production controls and price supports on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal funds to ``buy out'' and fairly compensate tobacco
farmers who wish to stop growing tobacco and for economic
development in a less tobacco-dependent environment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food and Drug Administration oversight over all manufactured
tobacco products, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the
Environmental Protection Agency having primary authority over
production of raw leaf.
</P>
<P>
   _ Effective controls over the sale, distribution and marketing
of tobacco to minors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funds to assist farmers and advance public health goals if
there is an increase in the federal excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   I encourage all the signatories to the core principles to
continue their efforts. They have established a process by which
diverse parties in this complex dispute can work together to
improve our society without compromising their fundamental needs.
</P>

   All's forgiven. Oscar Wilde is back in public, larger than life,
in the heart of London's theater district. A century after the
trial that crushed and jailed the Irish playwright for a homosexual
affair, Wilde's great-grandson, 19-year-old Lucian Holland,
unveiled a 9-foot-long monument to him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Maggi Hambling, titled ``A Conversation with Oscar
Wilde'' and situated near Trafalgar Square, the statue depicts
Wilde in bronze rising from a granite sarcophagus that forms a seat
where passers-by may sit.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription reads, ``We are all in the gutter, but some of
us are looking at the stars.'' At the unveiling, Culture Secretary
Chris Smith said, ``It's due to Oscar Wilde in many ways that we
today can celebrate a society that generally appreciates
diversity.''

   Many people go through life with a single, vivid taste image of
a lemon _ one of something acidic, clean tasting and unforgivingly
sharp. Unlike an orange, which can have dozens of flavors,
depending on the variety, the lemon has just one reliable note that
sticks firmly in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until they taste a Meyer lemon.
</P>
<P>
   This fruit, thought to be a cross between either a lemon and an
orange or a lemon and a mandarin, looks like a lemon, but with
tight orange-yellow skin when it's ripe. And it tastes more like a
lemon with a gentle streak. Its sharpness is softened with a
beguiling sweetness and an intoxicating perfume that's both floral
and herbaceous, a little like rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   The Meyer lemon has always been something of a California
secret, and every year when its brief growing season begins there,
as it has just now, eager cooks sigh with relief. The Meyer is not
as assertive as a Lisbon or a Eureka, the common supermarket
varieties, but it offers so much more in nuanced flavor that it is
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, the Meyer's secret is finally out. Chefs on the
East Coast and elsewhere are reaching for it as hungrily as those
in California.
</P>
<P>
   After tasting one, you get the sense that this is what a lemon
is supposed to be, and returning to one of those others after a
Meyer is like being dragged back to jug wine after learning about
Petrus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them so much,'' said Seen Lippert, the executive chef
at Metrazur, opening in Grand Central Terminal in New York City
this February. ``I use them for everything. I love to use them raw
in salads; I shave the skin into it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Meyer lemon contains about four times the sugar of a regular
lemon, but it can be used almost interchangeably with the Eureka
and Lisbon varieties, adding a smoother, rounder edge to both sweet
and savory dishes. The greatest difference, Ms. Lippert said, is
that with Meyer lemons you can use the whole thing _ from pulp to
peel. She marinates whole pieces with sardines, and ``ever so
slightly candies'' thin slices, she said, and adds them whole to
tarts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, her rhapsody gaining force, she will use
them with regular lemons in desserts, making ice cream from Eurekas
and serving it beside sorbet from Meyers. ``They're so fabulous,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Meyer lemon has left many chefs smitten. But perhaps none
more so than Lindsey Shere, the former pastry chef at Chez Panisse
in Berkeley, Calif. She is largely responsible for introducing the
fruit to American diners.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1980, the Meyer lemon came to Chez Panisse the way many
products did. Someone Ms. Shere or Alice Waters knew (they don't
remember who) had a tree in the yard. They were sold on their
taste, said Ms. Shere. It also helped that, coming from backyards,
they were organic. And organic supermarket lemons were difficult to
find then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't ever thought about as a way of introducing them
particularly,'' Ms. Shere said. ``It was more a statement of our
own philosophy.'' Just like organic chickens and mesclun greens.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shere began using the Meyer lemons in tarts and souffles,
and folding its wildly fragrant zest into batters and sauces. When
she wrote ``Chez Panisse Desserts'' (Random House, 1985), seven
recipes called for them. ``It's particularly appropriate for
dessert,'' she said, ``because it does have those sweet overtones
and that mellowness.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her Meyer lemon recipes, like a souffle, ice cream and
cream pie, are fairly simple, allowing you to appreciate the
nuances of its scent. It's much as you would treat a great tomato:
you wouldn't want to smother its goodness with other flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, unless you lived in California and had a Meyer lemon
tree in your yard, you almost certainly couldn't get them.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a convert. And before long, so were many other
California chefs. They got them the same way, from neighbors and
friends. It is an exchange that still exists. Chez Panisse, in
fact, still trades Meyer lemons for dinners. Friends of the
restaurant earn a free dinner for about every 100 pounds of lemons
they deliver.
</P>
<P>
   During the season _ which stretches from November to March _
chefs who know the fruit use it incessantly. Alan Tangren, now the
pastry chef at Chez Panisse, said the only time the Meyer lemon
failed him was when he made a lemon sauce. ``It was just boring,''
he said. ``For that kind of thing, you really need the acidity.''
</P>
<P>
   And when used as the acid in something like a vinaigrette, he
said, it is best to combine it with a mild vinegar like champagne
or rice wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a fuller, more heavily perfumed flavor in the mouth,''
said Ms. Lippert, who, by the way, is another alumnus of Chez
Panisse's kitchen. So, minor adjustments, like adding a little
vinegar or regular lemon juice to boost the acidity, simply require
tasting and making mental notes as you cook.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the lemon has a dedicated following. Before Ms. Shere and
others became devotees, though, the Meyer lemon had been primarily
an ornamental tree.
</P>
<P>
   The tree was brought to the United States from China in 1908 by
Frank N. Meyer, an influential plant explorer for the Agriculture
Department. Meyer had discovered it as a potted plant in Bejing and
introduced it here as an ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as productive as the devil, so it really caught on in
backyards,'' said Lance Walheim, an owner of California Citrus
Specialties, a grower of Meyer lemons.
</P>
<P>
   It might have caught on in kitchens earlier, too, had it not
been for a virus called tristeza (Portuguese for ``sadness'') that
was discovered in the plant in the 1940s. California agriculture
officials, concerned that the virus would be transmitted to larger
citrus groves, banned the Meyer in many of the citrus growing areas
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial growers didn't want anything to do with them,''
Walheim said. Then, the University of California at Riverside
interceded. By 1970, it had developed a tree without the disease,
which it called the Improved Meyer Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   There are still fewer than a dozen commercial growers of Meyer
lemons in California. And for many of them, ``commercial'' is
hardly the word that comes to mind when you see their groves and
packing houses. They are small and personal, more like boutiques
than malls. And they do not operate like the large citrus
producers, for which productive trees and profit margins are the
major priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley Meyer Lemons, owned by Charles and Marge Foskett, is
one of these small growers. In October in the Fosketts' backyard
grove in Napa, Calif., the Meyer lemons were at least a month
behind schedule. Chefs were beginning to fidget, but the Fosketts
were unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take them in and gas them to ripen them,'' Foskett
said, sitting in an easy chair next to a wood stove in his living
room. ``But we don't do that. We're just a mom-and-pop operation
here.'' The lemons will ripen when they ripen. And the chefs will
have to wait until they do.
</P>
<P>
   The Fosketts run their flourishing business entirely on their
own. Now that Foskett is retired from the Navy, they do it to keep
themselves busy, he said, and to pay a few bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marge does most of the picking,'' Foskett said. ``I do the
polishing and grading. Then we give out the best ones.'' They have
250 trees, all in a shallow basin behind their ranch house. Their
packing house is a small room about the size of a walk-in closet;
its walls are lined with old fruit-box labels and posters of
submarines. There are no machines.
</P>
<P>
   After harvesting, the Fosketts pour the buckets of lemons out
onto a carpet-covered table so they don't get bruised and, wearing
cotton gloves, they polish the fruits one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Foskett keeps meticulous records, too. During the 1996-97
season, she said proudly, reading her handwritten notes, they sold
precisely 32,483 Meyer lemons. That is an awful lot of polishing.
</P>
<P>
   Each Monday, Foskett calls up local restaurants, like the French
Laundry and Tra Vigne, for their orders. Then, they pick the
lemons, polish them and deliver them on Friday. The lemons may cost
a little more, but you can bet the Eureka lemons at the supermarket
aren't handled this way.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred miles south and seemingly a world away from the
Fosketts and their small grove is the Central Valley, California's
largest citrus growing area. From Stockton south to Bakersfield
stretches what looks like a plush green carpet of orange, lemon,
avocado and persimmon trees. The only thing that breaks up the
fabric is a grid of arrow-straight country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Fosketts' son Mike owns California Citrus Specialties,
with Walheim. With about 1,200 trees, it is one of the largest
growers of Meyer lemons, and it ships around the country. It may
not polish its lemons one by one, but it has a single family
harvest the lemons, and it takes them to a small organic-packing
house, where the fruit is treated more delicately.
</P>
<P>
   Its harvest last year of 65,000 pounds of Meyer lemons, though
huge compared with the Fosketts' in the Napa Valley, is still
peanuts next to the citrus growers surrounding them, with their
powerful machinery and factory-like packing houses.
</P>
<P>
   California Citrus Specialties grows varieties that the large
growers won't risk, so their groves feel as much like laboratories
as they do a working farm.
</P>
<P>
   On Walheim's property, for instance, blood orange trees
alternate with oroblancos (a cross between a grapefruit and a
pummelo), kumquats and Meyer lemons. He and Foskett were two of the
first California growers to plant blood oranges commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crap shoot with the specialty stuff,'' Walheim said.
``You never know what's going to happen.'' Lately, their bets have
been paying off. Their Meyer lemon crops have responded
prodigiously to the Central Valley's warm climate. And specialty
stores around the country are becoming more aware of these gems,
increasing their Meyer lemon sales by almost 20 percent every year
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Meyer lemon is far from becoming mainstream. It is
still largely a California product. ``If the acreage increased 10
more acres, it would flood the market with fruit,'' said Ben Faber,
a farm adviser for the University of California Cooperative
Extension in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   But the market for the fruit simply may never grow all that big,
and the network of small growers will likely remain. Several times,
Walheim said, the big citrus growers have made large plantings of
Meyer lemons, then failed to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fussy fruit. Its season is short. It must be clipped
from the tree, not pulled, and because it has a lot of juice and a
thin skin, it doesn't ship very well. To make matters worse, as the
season wears on and the fruit continues to ripen on the trees, the
Meyer lemons soften, making them as delicate to transport as eggs.
Few supermarkets are prepared to handle it in this ultra-ripe
state.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the tradeoff for something with such a
seductive fragrance and flavor. It must be hunted down at specialty
stores and it can be expensive _ between $1.99 and $2.99 a pound in
New York City stores, more than twice the price of a regular lemon.
</P>
<P>
   But think for a moment; you can taste the alternative in your
mind. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   1{ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   8 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces (about 2 and one-third cups) all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon plus [ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1\ pound (5 or 6) Meyer lemons
</P>
<P>
   5 large eggs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In the bowl of a mixer, cream together 8 ounces softened
butter (2 sticks) and { cup sugar. Add 1 egg yolk and the milk, and
beat to combine. In a medium bowl, combine the flour with \
teaspoon salt. Slowly add the flour to the butter mixture, stirring
until completely blended. Gather dough into two balls. Freeze one
for future use, chill the other for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heavily butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. On
a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a circle [-inch
thick. Transfer to the tart pan, press into the pan and trim the
edges. Prick the bottom with a fork, and place the shell in the
freezer for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While shell is in freezer, prepare lemon curd: grate zest of
lemons. Squeeze lemons to extract 1 cup of juice. In a medium
nonreactive saucepan, combine juice and zest. Add remaining 1 cup
sugar, remaining 5{ ounces butter and [ teaspoon salt. Place over
medium heat, stirring once or twice, until sugar is dissolved and
the butter is melted.
</P>
<P>
   4. In bowl of a mixer, combine eggs and remaining 7 egg yolks
until blended. Slowly add hot lemon mixture to eggs until blended.
Return mixture to saucepan, and place over low heat. Whisk
constantly until mixture thickens to a puddinglike consistency; do
not allow it to boil. Remove from heat, and continue to stir to
stop the cooking. Strain lemon curd into a bowl. Adjust sugar to
taste; the curd should be tart, but may need additional sugar if
the lemons were unripe. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it right
against the surface of the curd. Allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove tart shell from freezer,
and bake until lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat
and allow to cool slightly. Spoon lemon curd into tart shell, and
smooth the top. Bake until filling has puffed around the edges,
about 30 minutes. Cover edges with foil, if necessary, to prevent
over-browning. Cool to room temperature before serving.

</P>
<P>
   { cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus extra for coating the dish
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon cream of tartar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. &LR;  Separate eggs, placing 5 yolks in a small bowl, and 4
whites in the bowl of an electric mixer; discard the fifth white,
or reserve for another purpose. Whisk yolks just until blended,
then set aside. Set whites aside at room temperature, or
refrigerate if the souffle is to be served later in the day. Rinse
lemons with warm water, and grate and reserve the zest.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine 1{ tablespoons of the
sugar and the flour. Gradually stir in the milk, mixing until
smooth. Place pan over medium heat, and stir constantly until
mixture has boiled for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. While
whisking vigorously, slowly add several tablespoons of the hot milk
mixture to the egg yolks. Add yolk mixture to saucepan over medium
heat, and whisk just until the mixture is smooth and thick, and
light yellow in color, 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove saucepan from heat. Add butter, and stir until it has
melted. Stir in the reserved lemon zest, and set aside to cool. The
mixture may be refrigerated at this point for up to 4 hours; bring
to room temperature before baking.
</P>
<P>
   4. Half an hour before serving, preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Butter a 1{-quart souffle dish and coat it with sugar. Place the
bowl of egg whites over a bowl of hot water, and stir gently until
they are barely warmed. Using an electric mixer at medium speed,
whisk egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, and increase
speed to medium-high. Gradually add remaining 4 tablespoons of
sugar, whisking until whites are moderately stiff but not dry; they
should have smooth soft peaks with very fine bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add about \ cup of the beaten egg whites to the yolk mixture,
to loosen and smooth the yolks. Gently fold the yolk mixture into
the remaining egg whites, until barely mixed. Pour into the souffle
dish, and smooth the top. With the tip of a table knife, draw a
circle about an inch in from the side of the dish, and an inch deep
into the souffle mixture. Squeeze 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice
from one lemon. Trail juice over top of souffle, and sprinkle juice
lightly with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bake souffle until it has puffed and is golden brown on top,
about 20 minutes. If souffle is browning too quickly, reduce heat
to 375 degrees. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

RED TAPE KEEPS CHILDREN WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly three out of four uninsured children in New
York City are eligible for public health coverage, but barriers
built into the Medicaid application process and widespread
ignorance about another insurance program for low-income children
keep them unenrolled, according to a report issued Tuesday by the
Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on a series of focus groups conducted with
low-income families and Medicaid workers who screen families for
eligibility, found that parents were eager to get health insurance
for their children but were deterred by an enrollment process they
perceived as burdensome, confusing and even hostile.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, parents familiar with Child Health Plus, the other
program for low-income children, praised its ease of application,
but few families with eligible children had ever heard of it, the
report said. Even Medicaid eligibility workers were unaware that it
covered poor children ineligible for Medicaid, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The focus groups were structured to reflect New York City's
population and conducted in August and September by the Global
Strategy Group Inc. with the support of the fund, a large, private
philanthropic organization in New York. There are 370,000 uninsured
children in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandman, program officer at the fund, said the report
showed that the problem of uninsured children would not be solved
simply through the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and Child
Health Plus, scheduled to take effect in stages between Jan. 1,
1999, and July 1, 2000. The statewide expansions, financed with
$256 million a year in federal money, will ultimately cover
children in families with incomes of up to 250 percent of the
poverty line, or $41,059 for a family of four, potentially reaching
9 out of 10 children under 18 who now lack insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has decided that it makes sense, in both economic and
human terms, to provide health care coverage to low-income
children,'' Sandman said. ``But passing new legislation is only a
partial solution. The problem of hundreds of thousands of uninsured
children without health care in New York City will only be solved
by developing new outreach strategies and revamping the enrollment
processes for the programs we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of all children in New York City are now
uninsured, according to Department of Health figures. An earlier
study by the fund found that such children are far more likely than
their insured counterparts to go without preventive care,
immunizations and even acute medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The new report quoted parents who said they had lost family
insurance coverage when they went from full-time work to part-time
jobs, or from city employment to private industry, where they found
insurance premiums unaffordable and were unaware that their
children qualified for subsidized insurance. Others, who had left
public assistance, said they were not told that their children
still qualified for Medicaid, or said they had given up after
calling an automated Medicaid telephone line that provided
conflicting information about eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest complaints were about the Medicaid application
process. Parents said they must often miss several days of work to
gather and submit documents to Medicaid eligibility workers, whose
decisions strike many parents as arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents view workers as uninformed, unconcerned and rude and
believe they actively discourage enrollment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid eligibility workers from the city's Human Resources
Administration also expressed frustration with the enrollment
process, the report said, quoting workers who complained that they
were overwhelmed by paperwork and confusing rules.
</P>
<P>
   HRA spokesman James Whelan said, ``We have not seen the report
yet and therefore we cannot comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended retraining eligibility workers,
streamlining the Medicaid application process and reaching out to
low-income working families at schools, workplaces, day care
centers and coin laundries.

STATE DEPARTMENT JOINS CANADIAN GOVERNMENT SEEKING INTERVENTION IN
SCHEDULED EXECUTION IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The U.S. State Department has joined the Canadian
government in trying to persuade Gov. George W. Bush to spare the
life of a Canadian citizen scheduled to be executed next week for
the 1975 murder of a prominent East Texas woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Foreign Minister, as well as various human rights
organizations, have argued in recent weeks that 61-year-old Joseph
Stanley Faulder's death sentence should be set aside because he was
not told when he was arrested that he had the right to contact his
government _ a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on Consular
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consular-notification issues in this case are sufficiently
troublesome that they may provide sufficient grounds for according
discretionary clemency relief,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in a Nov. 27 letter to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is in the Middle East, has not seen the letter but
``will be briefed when he comes back to Texas,'' spokeswoman Linda
Edwards said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will read the letter and consider it carefully, as will the
Board of Pardons and Paroles,'' she said. ``The governor takes
capital cases very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy filed a
friend of the court brief in support of Faulder's final plea to get
his case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vienna Convention requires the `competent authorities' to
give prompt notice to detained foreign nationals of their right to
see a consular officer of their own government,'' the brief states.
``It is undisputed that the state of Texas denied Mr. Faulder's
rights of consular notification and access.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also argues that ``Texas refusal to comply (with the
treaty) is neither accidental nor aberrant'' and represents a
pattern of non-compliance throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Warren, an official with Amnesty International-Canada, said
there are 70 or so foreign nationals from 24 countries on death row
in the United States. ``The majority,'' he said, ``were never
informed of their Vienna Convention rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have maintained that Faulder had a U.S. driver's
license when he was arrested in Colorado more than a year after the
murder and, therefore, officers may not have known he was Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who has spent six years gathering material on Faulder's
case, said the documents clearly show that Faulder's nationality
was known to Texas investigators long before he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew he was born in Alberta and they even had his social
insurance number,'' he said, citing correspondence between
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's cause has been taken up not just by his government,
but by a number of private and official organizations. United
Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson, after meeting with
Axworthy last week, called for the lifting of Faulder's death
sentence and human rights groups have weighed in with fax
campaigns, Internet messages and press conferences. Others are
planning to descend on Austin from as far away as Toronto to lobby
for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most troubling death row cases in the
U.S.A.,'' said a fax distributed last week by Chicago-based
Citizens Alert, a ``humane law enforcement'' advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's appeal to the Supreme Court raises not only the
international treaty violation issue, but also the odd nature of
his prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on death row for 21 years for the 1975 robbery and
murder of Inez Phillips, 75, the matriarch of a wealthy oil family
in Gladewater, 110 miles east of Dallas. The Canadian government
and his family did not know of his whereabouts until 1992, when
they were notified by Sandra Babcock, a young attorney with the
Texas Resource Center, who had taken over his case.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Canadian government has attempted to have his
death sentence commuted to life on the grounds that had his
government and his family known of the charges, they could have
provided legal assistance and testimony that may have resulted in a
different sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At the punishment phase of the trial, Faulder's attorney,
Bernard Solomon, of Gladewater, Texas, did not call a single
witness to testify on his behalf _ a point that the prosecutors
emphasized in urging the jury to return a death verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the treaty had not been breached, there were people who
could have testified for Faulder,'' Warren said. ``The jury would
have known he was not a monster. The jury would have had an
alternative explanation of what happened that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The right to consular services for a foreign national, he said,
``rises to the level of Miranda (which requires arresting officers
to inform suspects of their rights). It raises the same issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Often described as a drifter, Faulder left his home in Jasper,
Alberta, in 1973, after his marriage went sour, and two years later
turned up in East Texas with some biker friends. In Gladewater,
just east of Longview, Texas, he and an accomplice, Lynda McCann,
broke into the home of Inez Phillips and killed her during the
course of the burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years later, he was arrested on an unrelated charge
in Colorado and returned to Longview to stand trial. His accomplice
refused to testify against him and there was no physical evidence
tying him to the crime, but Faulder was convicted and sentenced to
die on the strength of his own confession.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed the conviction
on the grounds investigators violated Faulder's Fifth Amendment
rights in obtaining the confession. Without it, the prosecution had
no evidence to present at a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was a rare, but legal, maneuver by the victim's son,
Jack Phillips. At a cost of $100,000, he hired two attorneys to act
as private prosecutors: Otis Hill, the former Gregg County district
attorney, and Phil Burleson, the Dallas lawyer who had achieved
fame by getting Jack Ruby's conviction for killing Lee Harvey
Oswald overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Burleson and Hill made a deal with Lynda McCann: If she would
testify against Faulder, they would grant her immunity in the case
and give her $15,000 to ``relocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Because an accomplice's testimony alone is not enough for a
conviction, it would have to be corroborated by a non-participant
in the crime. Lynda's husband, Ernie McCann, testified that the
murder happened just as she said. He was paid $2,000 by the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Babcock discovered in Burleson's files a
handwritten notation: ``Ernie in on all talking and planning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Brady material,'' she said, referring to a Supreme
Court ruling that requires prosecutors to turn over to the defense
materials that might be beneficial to the accused. That note was
not made available to Faulder's trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The note was critical, she said, because if it meant the husband
was a participant in the crime, his corroborative testimony was
invalid and, therefore, ``The state had no case.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the issue could be clarified, however, Burleson died in
1995 and the state's lawyers have since argued that the notation
was irrelevant and did not pertain to the husband's involvement in
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to the case, Warren said, was the fact that
Faulder's history was not made known to the jury _ particularly the
severe head injury he suffered at the age of 3, when he was hurled
from his family car after accidentally opening the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was severe enough that his brain was exposed,'' Warren
said. Growing up, Faulder suffered spells of manic hyperactivity
and blackouts, he said, and neurologists who examined him concluded
that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Had the jury known that history, he said, it might have decided
on a lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder has twice come within days of execution before being
granted stays. Each time, however, the courts were not swayed by
the issues of international treaty violation and questions about
the private prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Moore, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in
Washington, D.C., suggested that while the Foreign Ministry's
office has intervened in the Supreme Court petition, the most
effective route may be diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article 36 (the right to consular notification) is a very
important aspect of the Vienna Convention,'' he said. ``The
violation of it may have prejudiced his right to a fair trial.
Government's have to take that treaty seriously.'' &QL;

CLINTON PLEDGES NEW EFFORT TO HELP CHILDREN ORPHANED BY AIDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world marked AIDS Day for the 11th year,
President Clinton pledged Tuesday a new effort to help children
orphaned by the disease and more measures to help AIDS sufferers in
poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a poignant White House event attended by
children whose parents succumbed to the disease, also continued his
push for the development of an AIDS vaccine with a recommendation
for a 33 percent funding increase for research.
</P>
<P>
   New combinations of AIDS drugs and continued research have
helped drive down the rates of death from AIDS in the United States
and developed nations. But the disease remains rampant and deadly
in many developing nations where infection rates continue at
alarming rates and treatment is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When so many people are suffering, and with HIV transmission
disproportionately high, still, among our own young people here in
America, it's all right to celebrate our progress, but we cannot
rest until we have actually put a stop to AIDS,'' Clinton said. ``I
believe we can do it, by developing a vaccine, by increasing our
investment in other forms of research, by improving our care for
those who are infected and our support for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development estimated that 40
million children worldwide will be orphaned by the disease by 2010,
90 percent of them in developing nations with few resources. In the
United States, there currently are 80,000 children whose parents
have died from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the United States would provide $10 million in
emergency funding to community-based organizations overseas to
support orphans, to take steps to help prevent the spread of HIV
from mother to child and to improve medical care for children with
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot restore to them all they have lost, but we can give
them a future _ a foster family, enough food to eat, medical care,
a chance to make the most of their lives by helping them to stay in
school,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he will dispatch Sandra Thurman, his AIDS policy
adviser, to sub-Saharan Africa where 90 percent of the AIDS orphans
reside.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the National Institutes of Health dedicate $200
million to AIDS research, a $47 million increase from the current
funding level, for the next fiscal year. And, he proposed NIH
dedicate $164 million, a $38 million increase, to international
projects to help AIDS orphans and fight the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, at a separate event, also announced a
series of grants totalling $220 million from an existing program to
help fund housing for people with AIDS. Texas will receive $14
million in grants with Houston receiving more than half the amount,
$7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also pledged to a room
full of AIDS-funding advocates to put the AIDS issue on the
international agenda as she meets with world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to make progress, governments must understand what
you and your overseas counterparts already understand, and that is
that HIV-AIDS cannot be denied or ignored or patronized or put off
until tomorrow,'' Albright said. ``This is an urgent, deadly global
threat. It cannot be appeased; it must be confronted.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Slemmer, a Washington, D.C., woman who adopted an AIDS
orphan, spoke of the mother's anguish over who would care for her
daughter, now 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most painful conversations I've ever had was
discussing with Carla her wish that I raise Cynthia after Carla
died. Carla was desperate to be sure that Cynthia would have the
love and guidance to hang on to her dream. Knowing that Cynthia
would not be left alone gave Carla comfort and peace,'' Slemmer
said, who had been a volunteer working with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of children around the world just like Cynthia need a
second chance and do not get it. Millions of mothers around the
world just like Carla search for that feeling of peace just before
they die and they never find it,'' Slemmer said. &QL;

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY HEAD SAYS NO CONSENSUS ON REFORM
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a year of discussing Social Security and a
week before a major White House conference on the issue, Americans
have not reached a consensus on how to reform the federal old-age
insurance program, its director said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Press Club, Social Security
Administrator Kenneth S. Apfel said America cannot afford to miss
the opportunity next year to reform the program, which covers 45
million people, nearly a third of them disabled people or the
survivors of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is one of those defining moments for our
country,'' Apfel said. Referring to projections that the federal
budget will run a surplus for years to come, he asked, ``do we use
the surpluses for tax cuts, for spending increases, or for
strengthening Social Security?''
</P>
<P>
   Without reforms, Social Security benefits would exceed payroll
taxes in 2013, Apfel said. By 2032, the program's trust fund
surplus would be depleted, and taxes would cover only 75 percent of
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel's speech came amid a flurry of news conferences aimed at
setting the stage for the White House conference Dec. 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the conference will include presentations from
a variety of experts about the nature of the problem and potential
solutions. The second day, which will be closed to the public, will
involved discussions between Clinton and congressional leaders over
how to proceed with the reform process.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the first day of the conference will beamed by
satellite to sites around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to begin discussions with Congress early next
year, but Apfel would not indicate when _ or whether _ the
administration would offer its own plan to reform the system.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, William Shipman, co-chairman of the Cato
Institute Project on Social Security Privatization, suggested that
the public would be better served by allowing people to take 4 or 5
percent of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by workers and
employers and invest the money in individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Brookings Institute senior fellows Henry J. Aaron and Robert
Reischauer, at a news conference unveiling their analysis of
various reform proposals, said such a ``carve-out'' proposal would
weaken the existing system and impose an administrative nightmare
on businesses while failing to adequately protect retirement
income.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron and Reischauer suggested that Social Security could be
preserved by investing the trust fund surplus in private equity
accounts managed by a quasi-independent governmental agency, plus a
series of minor reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement among experts highlights what Apfel called the
``very big, very tough and very important issues. It's fair to say
that I have not heard a consensus among the American people about
how to protect and strengthen Social Security. Nor have I heard any
consensus here in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Apfel, who said that with the exception of a ``major increase''
in the payroll tax rate, all reform proposals are on the table,
noted that most carry tradeoffs which the American public generally
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Such tradeoffs include raising the eligibility age, raising the
tax rate by a smaller amount, or reducing benefits. Proposals to
allow individual investments are popular among young workers who
are willing to take more risks than older workers and retirees, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the Social Security system is not facing an
immediate crisis, Apfel said now was the time to act because any
changes could be gradually implemented and cause a minimum of
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he noted that the robust economy and the first
federal budget surplus in a generation set the stage for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House conference gives us an opportunity to start
talking about common ground for the common good,'' he said.

CLINTON TARGETS AIDS FUNDS FOR ORPHANS ABROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As death rates from AIDS have plummeted
dramatically at home, President Clinton announced Tuesday that the
government would provide more money and attention to help
developing nations defeat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All around us there is ... fresh evidence that the epidemic is
far from over, our work is far from finished,'' Clinton said at a
White House ceremony commemorating World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot forget our profound obligation for the heartbreaking
youngest victims of the disease _ the orphaned children left in its
wake,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton singled out Zimbabwe, where experts believe that 11
people are infected every minute. ``There are still too many
children orphaned by AIDS, tens of thousands here in America, tens
of millions in developing nations around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined Clinton and called
the spread of AIDS ``an urgent, deadly, global threat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do all I can to see that this imperative is raised as a
matter of international security at the highest levels, at every
opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a package of AIDS-related programs targeted abroad,
the president pledged $10 million to help care for foreign children
whose parents have died of AIDS, and he also said he would dispatch
to Africa his AIDS policy adviser, Sandra Thurman, to determine how
the United States can do more.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which will come from emergency funds and does not
require congressional approval, will be used for training foster
families and schooling orphans.
</P>
<P>
   The aid likely will have the most impact in Africa, where most
AIDS orphans live. The United States Agency for International
Development estimates that about 40 million children will be
orphaned by AIDS by 2010, with the vast majority living in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that the National Institutes of Health
would spend $200 million this year to develop AIDS vaccines, an
increase of $47 million over the previous year. The money is
already included in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Countries devastated by the disease will be major beneficiaries
of preventive AIDS vaccines, which currently are under development
at U.S. pharmaceutical companies and the NIH. An effective,
low-cost vaccine is eagerly awaited in destitute countries that
cannot afford the costly drug cocktails used to treat AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
   NIH also will spend $164 million this year, $38 million more
than the last year, to develop worldwide AIDS treatment and
prevention efforts, Clinton said. Some of the money will go for
training foreign scientists and devising new ways of blocking AIDS
transmission from a pregnant mother to her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcements came as AIDS organizations criticized
Clinton for not doing enough to slow the spread of the disease both
abroad and at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing skyrocketing infection rates and an AIDS
holocaust in Africa because of our failure to address prevention
and international efforts,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive
director of AIDS Action, which represents over 3,000 AIDS
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Government- and industry-sponsored research has resulted in
increasingly effective anti-viral drugs and a new class of
treatments known as protease inhibitors. As a result, the AIDS
death rate in the United States has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the number of deaths from AIDS fell 29 percent in 1996
and 47 percent last year, the largest decline for any major disease
in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   But because most developing nations cannot afford the drugs, the
disease is spreading in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   According to a United Nations study released last week, 2
million Africans will die of AIDS this year, four times the total
for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Africans also are infected at a higher rate that Americans.
About 33 million people around the globe are infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS _ two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa.
Worldwide, approximately 6 million people will be infected this
year with the human immunodeficiency virus, two-thirds of the cases
in Africa.

 &QL; 
ABUSE-ARIZONA (Undated) - Andy averts his eyes when he talks about
what happened to him in the shelter in Mesa, Ariz., in late 1996
and 1997. ``Basically,'' the 14-year-old says, sinking down in a
cushioned chair in his mother's office, ``I was raped.'' Now, he is
in the middle of a battle over how many Arizona children have
suffered sexual abuse after being placed in foster care. He is
among as many as 210 Arizona children who experienced such abuse
since the mid-1980s, court documents filed in Pima County Superior
Court in Tucson suggest. By KARINE BLAND. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WELFARE-WORK (Phoenix) - Desperate for workers to fill jobs in
their booming companies, some small businesses are turning to that
once-shunned group: welfare recipients. A look at who's hiring them
and how it works out. By JANE LARSON. Story will move in the ``F''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMPUTER COLUMN (Undated) - Quick! What computer titan recently
said: ``We share . . . a vision for the future in which consumers
will be able to access (our) brands anywhere, at any time, and from
any device.'' Oh yeah. It sure sounds like good old Bill Gates
pushing Windows again, eh? Guess again. It was Steve Case. By DAVID
HOYE. Story moved in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MUSEUMS (New York) - In the past, museums such as the American
Museum of Natural History, in New York, or the Smithsonian in
Washington, or the Field Museum in Chicago served as a kind of
cultural Noah's ark, preserving examples of the world we live in.
They served to educate us in the process, but the preservation of
the vast variety of life and nature was the museum's purpose.
Nowadays, museums have become part of the vast entertainment
industry, meant to keep us _ and particularly our attention-deficit
children _ from being bored. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the

 &HT;    CLINTON AND DOLE BROKE SPENDING LIMITS, AUDITORS REPORT
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 1996 presidential race, Democrat Bill
Clinton exceeded federal spending limits by more than $45 million
and Republican Bob Dole exceeded them by nearly $23 million,
according to federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Reports released Tuesday by the staff of the Federal Election
Commission note that in return for receiving federal money, each
candidate agreed in writing to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended the FEC order Clinton to repay $7
million and Dole to repay nearly $17.9 million to the U.S.
Treasury. The auditors also asked the commission to require Dole to
repay $1.1 million in overcharges to news organizations and $65,000
to the Secret Service for travel with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns dispute the findings, which led to a Justice
Department probe of the Clinton campaign and may lead to a similar
probe of Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign lawyers described the audit findings as
``grossly inequitable.'' Dole's denounced them as an attempt at
``circumventing enforcement procedures'' by trying to distort the
audit requirement into ``a punitive process or to recapture private
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The full FEC will start trying to sort out the dispute Thursday.
It takes four votes for a decision from the commission, which
consists of three Republicans and three Democrats. That process,
and subsequent appeals to the commission and within the courts,
could take years.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the simultaneous release of the reports on questionable
activities by both Clinton and Dole makes it harder for Republicans
to portray the Democratic president as the major violator of the
much-abused campaign finance laws during the 1996 campaign. That
could undermine efforts within the House Judiciary Committee to add
such violations to any bill of impeachment now under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said that in addition to uncovering an array of
minor discrepancies typical of past campaigns, they concluded that
Clinton exceeded the limits by $45 million in the primaries and
nothing in the general election, while Dole exceeded the limits by
$22 million -- about $9 million in thhe primaries and $14 million
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors reported:
</P>
<P>
   Though each candidate agreed to spend only $31 million in
private contributions and matching federal funds in the primaries,
Clinton spent more than $76 million and Dole spent more than $40
million. The excess consisted mostly of polls and TV ads that
helped the candidates but were paid for by the Democratic and
Republican national committees.
</P>
<P>
   Each would have to repay only the federal portion of that
overspending. That would cost Clinton $7 million and Dole $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   After each agreed to spend only $62 million in federal funds on
his post-convention campaign, Clinton abided by the limit, but Dole
spent about $76 million. Dole would have to repay the entire $14
million in over-spending, because general-election campaigns are
supposed to be financed 100 percent with federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The audits took more than 2 1/2 years to complete. Blaming
heel-dragging by the Clinton campaign, the auditors said they had
to resort to subpoenas more than 30 times to extract routine
records and other financial information from Clinton's
close-mouthed campaign aides and consultants.

HOLIDAY FUN FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS ALIKE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holiday books teach kids about the rituals of Christmas and
Hanukkah. Curling up on the couch with a favorite story year after
year also creates a family tradition _ a quiet time to reflect on
the deeper meaning of religious celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Here are highlights of new children's books for the season: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Christmas With Teddy Bear &QL; 
 &UR; Jacqueline McQuade (Penguin Putnam, $6.99)
</P>
<P>
   A brown cuddly Teddy Bear counts through the days till Christmas
in this delightful board book for toddlers. Teddy Bear walks young
children through the season's rituals: window shopping, building a
snowman, writing to Santa, singing carols, tree decorating,
wrapping presents, hanging his stocking, opening presents from
Santa _ and most important of all _ giving to others. The
illustrations of the Bear family and its pet kitten are
heartwarming, with familiar scenes little ones will enjoy. For ages
1-4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Maccabee Jamboree: A Hanukkah Countdown &QL; 
 &UR; Cheri Holland; illustrated by Roz Schanzer (Kar-Ben Copies, $4.95)
</P>
<P>
   The countdown to Hanukkah is celebrated by eight Maccabees who
disappear one by one as they polish the menorah, wrap gifts, twirl
dreidels, cook latkes, sing songs and light candles. When one
Maccabee is left alone wondering where everyone went, his friends
rush back with a big surprise! This and other Hanukkah books are
available through Kar-Ben, based in Rockville, Md. For ages 2-4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; The Mitten &QL; 
 &UR; Jan Brett (Penguin Putnam, $14.99 gift box)
</P>
<P>
   Very young children will get a kick out of donning a pair of
real mittens embossed with mole as they listen to this board book
gift edition of Brett's 1989 classic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a Ukrainian folk tale, the story is about Nicki, who
lost one of his white mittens in the snow. A mole found it and
crawled inside, followed by a rabbit, a hedgehog, an owl, a badger,
a fox, a bear, and a tiny little mouse, who made the bear sneeze.
Off went the mitten, flying back to Nicki. Brett's realistic,
detailed paintings of snowy winter scenes have a cozy holiday feel.
For the kindergarten set, Brett has illustrated a newly released
version of ``The Night Before Christmas.'' For ages 2-5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Max's Christmas &QL; 
 &UR; Rosemary Wells (Dial Books, $8.99)
</P>
<P>
   Max the bunny and his ever-exuberant sister, Ruby, experience
the excitement of Christmas Eve. Ruby insists on going to sleep
fast so Santa will come, but Max is determined to stay up late and
see the Big Guy himself. Wells, one of the most prolific authors of
children's literature, captures the zaniness with her goofy
characters in this board book. For ages 2-5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; The First Christmas &QL; 
 &UR; Adapted by Sindy McKay; illustrated by Mary O'Keefe Young (Treasure
Bay,
 &UR; $7.99)
</P>
<P>
   Parents and children can read together the Christmas story about
Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus in this holiday release from the
creators of the ``We Both Read'' series. Parents read the left-hand
pages, which contain more complex sentences and vocabulary, and
kids read the right-hand pages, written in simple language and
short sentences. Some words that carry over from the adult to child
page are highlighted in bold type for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent method to teach young readers, as well as
to encourage family togetherness. Other new titles are: ``The Three
Little Pigs''; ``Ben &AMP; Becky Get a Pet''; and ``About Bugs.'' For
ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Franklin's Christmas Gift &QL; 
 &UR; Paulette Bourgeois; illustrated by Brenda Clark (Scholastic, $4.50)
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas toy drive for needy families teaches Franklin the
turtle about the joy of giving . . . but not without considerable
internal struggle. He digs through his 60 jillion old toys and
decides there is maybe ONE he could live without _ a rusty truck
with a missing wheel. But his Dad says that isn't even close to
being ``gently used.''
</P>
<P>
   More struggle follows before Franklin decides to give away
something near and dear to him. Far from making him sad, Franklin
gets ``that good-all-over feeling.'' Clark's illustrations of the
animal characters going through human activities are charming. For
ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Dear Santa &QL; 
 &UR; The Best-Ever, Busiest Christmas Fun Book (Dutton, $16.99)
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is one of the best parts of Christmas. This
activity book contains 24 envelopes for kids to open each December
day preceding the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes on the left side contain notes from Santa, craft
ideas, ornaments and song lyrics. On the opposite page are short
stories about Christmas customs in other parts of the world _ such
as luminarias in Mexico and Boxing Day in Australia. Suggestions
for activities such as baking cookies and making gift tags also are
included. For ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; This Is the Star &QL; 
 &UR; Joyce Dunbar; illustrated by Gary Blythe (Harcourt Brace, $6)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Christ child, born to be king, while hosts of
heavenly angels sing. . . .'' Dunbar's rhythmic text guides readers
through the story of the Nativity, beginning and ending with a lone
star in the night sky. Blythe's museum-quality paintings are so
realistic they are like photographs with an artist's soft touch.
First released in hard-cover in 1996, the volume won a ``Publishers
Weekly'' Best Book of the Year award. Now, it is in a more
affordable paperback version. For ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; The Nutcracker &QL; 
 &UR; Story adapted by Natalia Merentseva and Michele Spirn; illustrated
by Azat
 &UR; Minnekaev (Harry N. Abrams, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas favorite, penned in 1816 by German author E.T.A.
Hoffmann, is interpreted by a Russian husband-and-wife team with
help from children's author Spirn.
</P>
<P>
   Minnekaev's illustrations of young Clara's journey through the
wondrous land of fairies and make-believe have an ephemeral quality
_ almost like the ballet. But unlike the ballet, the text includes
a sub-plot from the original story about a sausage-hungry Mouse
Queen who casts a spell on the young prince, transforming him into
the Nutcracker.
</P>
<P>
   Oversize pages and easy-to-read type make this authentic version
of the tale a bedtime treat. For ages 7-10. &QL;

VISITORS ESCAPE TO ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE, DISCOVERING BEAUTY,
MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHY FRISINGER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unbelievably, our 25th anniversary was approaching. To
celebrate, my husband and I planned a trip to Italy with our best
friends, also marking that anniversary. The four of us pored over
maps and travel books, plotting out an itinerary that would take us
through Rome, Florence, Venice _ all the usual tourist places. But
then I talked to my friend Carol, who had lived in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just going to the cities?'' Pause. I swear I could hear
a frown over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Capri is my favorite place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So we eventually found ourselves on the Circumvesuviana, the
train that rings the Bay of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   But things weren't going so well. There had been an unpleasant
misunderstanding about luggage at the Naples train station, a black
and gloomy place, and then a race to the train. By the time we
boarded, it was standing-room-only in a compartment where
passengers were packed like anchovies. And the air conditioning
wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while, the crowd inside the rail car thinned, and
outside the window we saw an intriguing sight: rows of trees heavy
with smiley-face-yellow fruit. Lemons!
</P>
<P>
   When the train made a stop on a bridge over a deep gorge where
picturesque homes dotted the sides of the rock and the blue of the
Mediterranean sparkled in the background, I breathed a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   That view turned out to be a preview of our experience in
Sorrento, where sheer cliffs drop off to the Mediterranean and a
gorge cuts through the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a place for darting about seeing churches and museums,
but rather a haven to kick back, sleep late in the morning, swim in
the afternoon and lounge at an outdoor bar for hours at night.
</P>
<P>
   Though not exactly inexpensive, hotels in Sorrento are a bargain
compared with tourist-thick cities like Rome and Florence. Our room
at the Hotel Caravel was by far the largest, most luxurious room of
a two-week Italy trip, but, at $120, cost less than any of our
accommodations in the northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   We slowed our pace to match the tempo of the town, sleeping in
in the morning and then taking a swim.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, after a hot, dusty day of sightseeing in
Pompeii, we found a trattoria _ a casual dinner spot _ not quite on
the water, but close enough to it that cool breezes came in through
the open doors and windows. A white cat came through one of the
windows. Maybe it was attracted by the seafood, which was perhaps
the best meal of our trip. We fondly remember the linguine mare, an
artfully displayed dish of pasta, mussels and clams in their
shells.
</P>
<P>
   POMPEII: Pompeii knocked our socks off.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get there _ the Circumvesuviana stops right outside
the entrance to the city (about 30 minutes east from Sorrento or
south from Naples). And it's a bargain, too. Admission is about $7,
and an audio tour is about $5.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting tourists enter the excavated ruins of the city _ buried
by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius _ via a tunnel through the
defensive walls that surround it, just as visiting traders did
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You can see Vesuvius in the background; its last eruption was in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins with the forum, which was the center of life of
the ancient city. It's surrounded by the remains of public
buildings, including the temple of Jupiter and Minerva, a market
and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   As you leave the public area, you enter into a maze of narrow,
cobblestone streets. I had seen pictures of rows of small, square
rooms that I had taken to be the homes of Pompeii's residents.
Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The well-to-do lived in large, multiroomed, sometimes
multistoried houses, with hallways, courtyards, murals, tiled
mosaic floors, gardens in the back, a form of indoor plumbing, and
even indoor pools. The rows of small rooms turned out to be shops
attached the fronts of the homes of the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The audio tours proved invaluable. The tavern owners were
considered to be disreputable women, we were told. People rose
early, and everyone, including slaves, finished work in the
morning, which made the baths popular afternoon recreation for all
Pompeii's residents, we learned.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ghoulish but intriguing prizes of Pompeii is the
excavated bodies of people who were buried in ash and stones from
the eruption in A.D. 79. Most of the 20,000 residents escaped the
eruption, but about 2,000 lingered and were buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies we saw seemed tiny. ``The fingers show the
characteristic curl of oxygen starvation,'' the tape noted.
</P>
<P>
   Farther on into the city, in the entryway of a dwelling dubbed
the ``House of the Tragic Poet,'' a black-and-white mosaic picture
of a dog bears a neighborly warning: cave canem, (beware of the
dog).
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Following cobblestone streets rutted by ancient wagons to the
far side of Pompeii brings visitors to the most impressive home of
the site, the Villa dei Misteri (the House of Mystery). The
palatial house is a maze of rooms, one of which contains a
beautifully preserved series of murals.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRI: The fabled beauty of Capri has drawn men and women of
wealth for thousands of years. When Augustus Caesar needed to get
away from it all, he escaped to Capri. Tiberius made his court on
the island. George Bernard Shaw and D.H. Lawrence found inspiration
on its heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now hydrofoil boats make the island in the Mediterranean a
convenient day trip for travelers of more modest means.
</P>
<P>
   The ride from Sorrento to Capri is a delight in itself. With
summer temperatures in southern Italy that almost rival Texas
scorchers, skimming across the sea on a hydrofoil with cool air
rushing across your face was a welcome experience.
</P>
<P>
   The towering island has three towns: Marina Grande, at sea
level, where the hydrofoils and ferries dock; Capri, partway up the
island, with the best views and the best restaurants and the best
shops catering to the ``best'' people; and Anacapri, higher up
still but with less lofty standards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unexpected pleasures of Capri was the fun of just
getting around from place to place. A funicular hoists people from
Marina Grande up to Capri town. We mostly traveled by bus, the
highest, narrowest buses I'd ever seen, on the narrowest roads I'd
ever ridden along.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous sight on Capri is the Grotto Azure _ the Blue
Grotto. But if Pompeii was the biggest success of our trip, the
Blue Grotto was the biggest disappointment. It's not that the
cavern isn't as pretty as reputed, or that it's hideously expensive
(about $10 per person) _ it's just that the whole experience takes
only about three minutes. Hoping to earn a tip, our boat driver
offered to sing for us. ``No, please don't,'' I said. He sang
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to have traveled all the way to Capri and not to have
seen the ethereal blue light in the grotto would be unthinkable. A
little rest and a little limoni (a liqueur that looks like liquid
sunshine and tastes like liquid fire) revived us.
</P>
<P>
   Capri, like much of Europe, takes a nap in the afternoon. But in
the early evening, when the daytrippers have departed and the
temperatures have dropped, the place gets gussied up.
</P>
<P>
   Then the upper-crust visitors _ men decked out in white suits,
women in summer evening dresses _ stroll the streets of Capri town,
admiring an Armani suit in a shop window, stopping in at Cartier to
pick out a little bauble as a souvenir of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Our traveling companions went to Capri for the evening, but we
decided to stay in Anacapri and walk out to a scenic overlook on
the far side of the island.
</P>
<P>
   We headed down Via Magliara, a street that is little more than a
paved path. It took us through what I decided must be the most
intensely farmed spot in the world. Each gate that we passed led
into a two-level garden. At the ground level there were rows of
beans or potatoes or some other garden staple. But each yard also
had a second story, about 12 feet above ground level, thick with
grapevines.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't imagine that the understory vegetables would get
enough light to grow successfully, but all the doubledecker gardens
seemed lush and green.
</P>
<P>
   The yards we passed had high walls in front, but we could see in
through the gates and we could hear cooking sounds and voices
coming from inside the homes as we strolled past. Behind one gate,
an elderly woman, her head wrapped with a kerchief, sat reading to
three small children. Her voice rang clear in the quiet of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Via Magliara ends at a gorgeous overlook with a view of the Puta
del Tuono lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   After an admiring pause, we turned around and headed back a few
hundred yards to Da Gelsomina, a recommended trattoria, where we
stopped for dinner. There were a half-dozen other tables occupied,
all by stylish young Italians. How had all those other people
gotten to this place, I wondered? We'd walked for 40 minutes and
had only passed one other couple along the path.
</P>
<P>
   As we sat there sipping wine, pondering _ but not too hard _
this mystery, I decided I agreed with Carol. Mixing a little of
Mother Nature's artwork in with our tour of the Renaissance
masterpieces was a wonderfully romantic idea. And, yes, I think
Capri is my favorite place in the world, too.

QUEBEC ELECTION DOES LITTLE TO EASE UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A joke has it that what Quebecers really want is an
independent Quebec in a strong unified Canada.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly the contradictory message that emerged Tuesday
as the smoke cleared from Monday's closely-watched provincial
elections.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, voters in the only Canadian province with a
French-speaking majority handed Premier Lucien Bouchard's
separatist Parti Quebecois a strong reelection victory: 75 seats in
the 125-seat National Assembly, or provincial legislature. Plus,
the Parti Quebecois may capture another seat in a special election
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the same voters refused to lay electoral
waste to the federalist challengers, led by Jean Charest, with
anything like the savagery pollsters and pundits so confidently
predicted right up until ballot tallies showed a tighter race than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of either crushing federalism in Quebec or giving the
separatist movement irrestible momentum, the elections did little
more than reinforce the political uncertainty that has bedeviled
Canada for four years, since the Parti Qubecois vaulted to power in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of secession is still pressed against the nation like
the muzzle of a loaded gun. For now, the separatists don't have the
strength to pull the trigger. But Bouchard has five more years in
office to work on bulking up that trigger finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Parti Quebecois victory, although impressive, failed to
become the landslide that Bouchard had so fervently wished. At the
same time, the drubbing taken by federalists stopped short of total
rout.
</P>
<P>
   One bizarre result: the victors wore mostly scowls, while the
losers couldn't stop strutting and grinning into the television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard ducked and weaved around questions about the prospects
of another referendum on independence, promising only that Quebec
would ``carry on in pursuit of its destiny. We are committed to
stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he admitted, ``winning conditions for a referendum do
not exist at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest, meanwhile, was happily holding court with supporters
and journalists, assuring everyone that federalist defeat was
really a ``moral victory,'' while separatist victory was defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Quebec and the people of Canada all want this
country to work together,'' he told a news conference. ``The
members of the Parti Quebecois today have to be very uncomfortable
with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if he'd engineered one of the great upsets in
political history. He hadn't. All Charest had done was confound
analysts by losing somewhat less spectacularly than projected.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances count for a lot in politics. And Charest did
score one indisputable victory by garnering a slightly larger share
of the popular vote _ about 0.7 percent larger _ than the
separatists. Because of the composition of electoral districts in
Quebec, however, the Liberals still captured only 48 seats in the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Charest's ``popular victory,'' as jubilant
supporters described it, owed little to the federalist campaign.
Instead, the separatists suffered as a larger-than-anticipated
number of votes were siphoned off by a tiny third party, Action
Democratique-Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Led by 28-year-old Mario Dumont, Action-Democratique is a
right-leaning party, opposed to secession, that won surprising
support from young people disaffected by the endless bickering
between federalists and separatists. Although Action-Democratique
won nearly 12 percent of the vote and was arguably the only true
``moral victor,'' Dumont was the sole party member to actually win
a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Action-Democratique was the only Quebec party to gain supporters
since the 1994 election, roughly doubling its ballot tally to
454,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebecers want constitutional peace,'' Dumont said. ``More and
more Quebecers are sick and tired of the old squabbles of the old
parties.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful storm will buffet the Pacific Northwest on
Wednesday, bringing inclement weather to northwest California and
western sections of Oregon and Washington. Windswept heavy rain
will douse coastal areas as moist Pacific air is lifted by an
approaching cold front. As ocean air is further lifted and cooled
by the interior mountains, rain will turn to heavy snow above 4,000
feet with over a foot of fresh snow blanketing the southern
Cascades and Klamath mountains by Thursday morning. Meanwhile,
showers and higher elevation snow will accompany a small jet stream
disturbance crossing the interior Southwest, bringing showers and
mountain snow to northern Arizona and western New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually warm air will continue to cover much of the eastern
and central states Wednesday as the jet stream retreats northward
into southern Canada. Amid ample sunshine, afternoon temperatures
will rise into the 60s from the Front Range of the central Rockies
to the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic states. Farther north,
patchy light sleet will precede the arrival of warmer air across
northern New England. Sunshine and mild conditions will also
prevail in the Great Lakes, though a few clouds will accompany a
weak cool front across the upper peninsula of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool start, abundant sunshine will boost daytime
readings to above normal levels over the Southeast. Farther south,
partly cloudy and warm conditions will cover Florida with isolated
showers forming near the east coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Making A Connection
</P>
<P>
   A tardy freeze in the southern Plains is related to record rains
in the Pacific Northwest. At Oklahoma City, Tuesday marked the
latest date on record without a freeze, eclipsing Nov. 30 (in 1934)
as the latest date for the season's first occurrence of 32 degrees.
Persistent jet stream winds from the west over northern-tier states
have impeded the plunge of cold air from Canada. This steadfast jet
stream also energized and steered a parade of wet disturbances into
the Pacific Northwest, where rainfall at Astoria, Ore., reached an
all-time November high of 19.60 inches Tuesday.

IN THIS LONDON 'HOOD, THE BOYZ HAVE MANY ACCENTS AND SHOPPING IS
ECLECTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
and NICHELE HOSKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's Saturday morning, and the sun is shining as we
board the underground (subway) in Paddington, a predominantly
white, middle- to upper-middle class section of London. We're
headed for the 'hood _ Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   As African-American children of the '80s, we couldn't NOT go to
Brixton, immortalized by singers like Eddie Grant and second-wave
ska bands like the Specials.
</P>
<P>
   In south London, Brixton is a 20-minute tube ride on the
Victoria Line from our Paddington hotel. When we step onto Tunstall
Road, one of the neighborhood's main drags, its sidewalk is crowded
with people heading to or from the indoor/outdoor bazaar on
Electric Avenue. A Rastafarian we encounter on the way gives us a
handbill advertising a rally to protest police actions in the case
of Stephen Lawrence, a black man slain by racist thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The cloying smell of incense and the occasional whiff of rotting
garbage are a sharp change from deodorized Central London. Brixton
is a 180-degree change from the formal splendor and British Tourist
Authority appeal of Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace and
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With its small shops, eateries and neighborhood feel, it's
reminiscent of the Shaw neighborhood in Washington, D.C.
Ironically, both were the sites of urban unrest, ignored by the
establishment for years, and then finally resurrected through
economic development and gentrification.
</P>
<P>
   We step into an Italian coffee bar for some strong joe and flaky
croissants. As we sit at the bar, we eavesdrop on an animated
conversation between the owner and his friend. They're speaking
Arabic, not Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified, we leave in search of the bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Brixton is to London what Brooklyn is to New York. Blacks have
lived in the U.K. for centuries, but in the 1950s, Brixton became
the center of migration from former British colonies such as
Jamaica, India and Nigeria. Today, it has become a haven for
refugees from war-torn countries: Vietnam, Somalia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Brixton's Electric Avenue bazaar caters to this ethnically and
culturally diverse clientele. Electric Avenue was made famous in
the 1980s by the eponymous Eddie Grant song; the street got its
name when it became the first shopping street in London to get
electricity, in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a shopping hub ever since. Located behind the tube, or
subway, stop, the bazaar is packed with browsers and vendors. The
entire city of London is so crammed that people often bump into
you. But only in Brixton do they say, ``Excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar's shops _ some no larger than booths _ are an
eclectic mix, selling everything from vintage clothes and vinyl
records to synthetic hair for braids and novelty lighters.
</P>
<P>
   In one booth, a Nigerian seamstress takes a modern turn on
traditional clothing. The fitted, hip-length jackets have wide,
embroidered drop collars, and they come with skirts that skim the
leg line. Nice, but not at $100 American.
</P>
<P>
   Janette finds a West Indian bakery that specializes in Jamaican
beef patties and coco bread. She buys two of each for about $4.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the bazaar are signs praising the Reggae Boys, the
Jamaican soccer team that made it to the World Cup. The borough
where Brixton is located has the highest proportion of
Afro-Caribbean residents in London, and the third highest of
Africans. The local business community is heavily Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   Produce, fish and meat, as well as dry goods, dominate the
bazaar. There's fresh coconut and cassava as well as fenugreek and
whole nutmeg. The scotch bonnet peppers are twice as big as your
eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   The tangy-sweet smell of mango mingles with the chemical stench
of hair straighteners.
</P>
<P>
   We raid the ATM machine, which gives us the best exchange rate.
Then we buy hand-painted glass candlesticks for $15 a pair; a
silver-and-garnet snake armlet and a rainbow sweater for $30 each
and some African-looking fabric from a West Indian woman for $1.60
a yard.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of shopping, we duck into Joseph's Bar and Cafe.
Our waitress disappears after seating us, so we order our food at
the bar. The nouveau Jamaican food arrives via dumbwaiter.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth the wait. Delicious salt cod and ackee and a side
dish of fried plantain cost $14; salmon with a lime beurre blanc on
a bed of calaloo, or cooked greens, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is Red Records, where a member of the Fruit of
Islam tells one of us he knows she is American because she's
friendly and wears her hair natural. Red's is known as the place to
buy everything from jazz and R&AMP;B to ska and reggae. We purchase
some Nina Simone albums that we've been unable to find in the
States.
</P>
<P>
   Brixton is also known for its night life, but we are too tired
from an earlier foray in Central London to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days earlier in Central London, we'd tried to get
into Heaven _ the one on Charing Cross Road known as the city's
largest gay/straight dance club. Unfortunately, Heaven is closed
for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   There's a country song in there someplace.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we chat up a ``gypsy'' cabdriver and we're off to
his favorite haunt, the Tube. Located on Falconberg Court in Soho,
the club has low ceilings, black lights and hand-painted
fluorescent decorations. The groove is thumping techno-funk.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2 a.m. Friday, we find a licensed cab easily. No such
luck the next night in Soho. After a long walk along The Strand
through Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square, we arrive at
Charing Cross Hotel. About 100 people are lined up waiting for
cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a drunken fellow with a shaven head who looks as
if he just lost a fight; dried blood cakes his nose and jeans. When
one driver loads a group of posh women into his cab, the drunk
calls him dirty names. Loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Not the best tactic. The cabby who finally picks us up says he
chooses weekend fares carefully to avoid the drunks.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbies in the roomy black cabs are friendly, and unlike the
independent ``gypsy cabs,'' they must pass ``The Knowledge'' _ a
rigorous test to prove they know London's streets by heart. The
Public Carriage Office, or PCO, which is run by the London police
department, tests drivers, issues licenses to those who pass and
makes sure their vehicles are road ready.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Like any first-time visitors to the city on the River Thames, we
also visit sites like the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington and
the royal jewels at the Tower of London.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tower, we first watch videos of the pretties and the
ceremonies in which they are used. Then a conveyor belt glides us
past glass cases containing the loot: crowns, scepters, ceremonial
spoons and other sparklies.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, George the Yeoman Warder, is the best part of our
Tower visit. Yeoman Warders once guarded the Tower, which is
actually several towers built over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In a booming voice, George tells us why the well-fed ravens hang
around. The romantic legend is that if the ravens ever leave, the
Tower of London and the Crown will fall.
</P>
<P>
   The tale gets grisly and involves ``soggy bits.'' Back in the
old days, folk got beheaded at the Tower with gruesome regularity.
George tells us how the noggins of the unfortunate were stuck onto
pikes near the Thames, where fat, happy ravens dined upon their
soggy bits: eyes, tongues, lips, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We recommend spending the $14 to see the Tower. The Big Bus Tour
Company of London is also worth the $18 ticket. You can hop buses
and routes to travel throughout Central London for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The bus puts us off on Piccadilly Circus. We stroll past St.
James's Palace, cut through calming Green Park and arrive at
Buckingham Palace in time to catch the changing of the guard with
about 900 other tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The show in front of the queen's crib is overrated, but it's
free. And we do see Emperor Akihito of Japan ride through the
palace gates.
</P>
<P>
   The Keeper of the Chrysanthemum Throne waves. We wave back.
</P>
<P>
   We go to Harrods in Knightsbridge, just to say we did.
</P>
<P>
   There, we skeptically look for a lawn mower in the famously
swank department store _ and find one. We're taken with the
Egyptian Hall until we realize that the sphinxes bear a freaky
resemblance to Harrods' owner, Mohammed al Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the store's restrooms are exclusive. If you're a mere
window shopper, expect to pay $1.60 to answer the call in Harrods.
The loo is free only if you've bought something.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On our last night in London, we buy tapas at a restaurant near
our hotel, unwrap the beef patties and coco bread and uncork a dry
riesling. We drag some chairs out on the balcony, put on thick
sweaters and enjoy the view of Norfolk Square. We feel like
characters in a Merchant and Ivory film.
</P>
<P>
   Then we hear a voice from below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to speak to you,'' says the voice.
</P>
<P>
   We look down and introduce ourselves to a young black man named
Yusef. He tells us he lives in a two-bedroom flat and is one of the
few blacks residing in Paddington. The apartment was a gift from
his Senegalese father; that's the only way a 26-year-old struggling
musician could afford such a tony neighborhood. We banter
flirtatiously about music, race relations and how much we love
Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Yusef tells us he visited the United States but returned to the
U.K. because it's home; this despite harassment by bobbies who
constantly stop him and ask him what he is doing in Paddington.
</P>
<P>
   Yusef says he is surprised that we ventured into the 'hood. He
says most tourists and even some London residents don't visit.
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced Brixton for ourselves, we honestly can't
imagine why not.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As the global oil industry regroups to
confront the continuing slump in crude-oil prices, Total SA, the
giant French oil company, said Tuesday that it would acquire the
Belgian petrochemical company Petrofina SA in a stock swap worth
$13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offer _ which came as the ink was still wet on the agreement
by Exxon to acquire Mobil in a record $77.2 billion takeover,
creating the world's largest oil company _ was seen as the first
step in a consolidation of the European oil industry, which has
been characterized in large part by national companies serving
narrow domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Petrofina, which employs 14,700 people worldwide, is Belgium's
biggest industrial group, with refining and distribution operations
in Europe and the United States, including Fina of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Total, France's No. 2 oil company after Elf Aquitaine, employs
54,400 and has expanded its crude-oil and gas businesses in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a stock swap that initially gives Total, which is
the world's ninth-biggest publicly traded oil company by revenue, a
41 percent stake in Petrofina. It will buy 9.6 million shares from
five large stockholders by issuing nine new shares of its own for
every two Petrofina shares.
</P>
<P>
   The offer values Petrofina at 19,482 Belgian francs, or $557, a
share based on Friday's closing stock prices, a 37 percent premium
before word of the agreement leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Petrofina's shares will be bid on at a later
date, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the deal, which must be approved at a joint
shareholder meeting on Jan. 14, would not lead to sweeping cuts in
employment. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the price of North Sea Brent, the European
benchmark crude oil, has tumbled by half to a little more than $10
a barrel, and oil companies are struggling to cut costs to keep
profit growing as oil demand stagnates.
</P>
<P>
   Since British Petroleum's $48 billion bid for Amoco Corp. in
August, which would create the world's third-biggest oil company,
speculation had been widespread about a possible sale of Petrofina,
whose growth prospects were limited outside its niche as a European
fuel maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move is part of a global change,'' said Thierry Desmarest,
the chairman of Total, which is based in Paris. Noting in a
statement that oil prices had practically been cut in half over the
last year, he said, ``All companies are seeking to survive in this
new situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrofina said in a statement that the takeover would lead to an
increase in operating profit of 2 billion French francs, or $553
million, within three years. The combined company, to be called
Total Fina, will have about $52 billion in revenue, roughly the
same as Italy's Eni SpA, which is Europe's third-largest oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors on the Paris stock exchange, evidently judging the
premium Total offered out of line with the potential for cost
reductions, reacted skeptically. Total's share price tumbled by
more than 11 percent, or 78 French francs, to 627 francs. In
Brussels, Petrofina's share price surged as much as 26 percent, or
3,700 Belgian francs, to 17,950 francs.
</P>
<P>
   But Susie Mayne, who follows the oil industry at BT Alex. Brown
in London, called the investor reaction ``highly unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this diluting earnings over the short term,'' she said,
``but it strengthens the hand of both.'' Total, she added, had
proved to be an extremely well-managed group and Petrofina, unlike
many of its rivals, had remained profitable in the core
petrochemicals business through the downside of recent cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Total predicted that the merger would lift per-share earnings by
10 percent in three years and that operating profit would rise
beyond previous forecasts by 2 billion French francs, also in three
years. Ms. Mayne said she thought the estimate was ``on the low
side.''

 &HT;    SUN WITNESS: MICROSOFT SEEKS TO MONOPOLIZE JAVA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft is seeking to ``fragment'' the promising
Java software technology in order to protect its Windows monopoly,
its creator charged in antitrust testimony released by the
government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 34-page brief, Sun Microsystems Inc. vice president James
Gosling warned that ``if Microsoft successfully fragments the Java
technology, the cross-platform benefits to vendors, developers, and
users ...will be damaged and any threat that (it) poses to
Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system (for personal
computers) will be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Since software written using Java can run independently of
operating systems, developers refer to it as a ``write once, run
anywhere'' technology. Fearing that the rise of Java could reduce
the importance of Windows, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates once wrote
in an e-mail message that the Java cross-platform threat ``scares
the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its wide-ranging antitrust suit, the government
contends that Microsoft Corp. has illegally encouraged developers
to write software using a Windows-only version of Java while
ignoring Sun's universal standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead attorney
in the landmark trial, called the government's charge that
Microsoft tried illegally to maintain its Windows dominance ``the
core of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosling's testimony was released only after U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the case without a jury,
blew up at Microsoft's legal team for stretching out its attack on
a government expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be brought to a halt,'' Jackson told Michael
Lacovara after the company's lawyer sought to extend his
cross-examination of economist Frederick Warren-Boulton into a
seventh trial day.
</P>
<P>
   As the next move in the legal chess game, Boies plans to play
about two hours of Gates's videotaped testimony on the Java issue
before the Microsoft team challenges Gosling on the witness stand
for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   As Gosling sees it, Microsoft, Sun's arch-rival in the software
business, ``has used its ubiquitous operating system to flood the
market with its Microsoft-dependent implementation'' of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's actions threaten to make its implementation, called
Java Direct, ``the de facto standard, thus eliminating the threat
posed by the Java technology to Microsoft's operating system
monopoly,'' Gosling wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a federal judge in a related lawsuit issued a
preliminary injunction against Microsoft that prevents the company
from selling any version of Java incompatible with Sun's so-called
``pure Java,'' which is both a programming language and a set of
mini-applications that run mainly on Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling, in his testimony, also said he was told in February
1997 by a Microsoft official that the software giant ``wouldn't be
cowboys'' and develop a Windows-specific version of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the widespread availability of products that distribute
Sun's Java technology, its relative lack of success in the
marketplace cannot be blamed on Microsoft,'' the corporate
defenders said in a statement aimed at refuting Gosling's testimony
before he is sworn in as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun set unreasonable marketplace expectations and failed to
deliver on its promises. Further, it is Sun that is attempting to
foreclose developer and customer choice by insisting Java cannot be
used efficiently to develop applications that take full advantage
of a particular operating system, despite the fact the majority of
developers today are using Java in this way,'' the Microsoft
statement concluded.

   LUMBINI, Nepal _ Some 2,500 years ago, on a spring day under a
full moon, Siddhartha Gautama was born in Lumbini. His mother had
gone into labor while on a stroll in a verdant grove, smelling the
flowers and listening to the songbirds. The baby would grow up to
be the Enlightened One _ the Buddha _ and this village would become
holy soil to millions of Buddhists who, for the most part, would
these days never think of coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the flat, steamy lowlands of southwestern Nepal,
Lumbini is not only off the beaten track, it is away from an
adequate supply of sewer pipes, telephone lines, electric lights,
clean sheets and mosquito control. Thirty years of planning to
develop the site have thus far failed to make it the Buddhist
counterpart of a Mecca or Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The royal government of Nepal would like to change that. On
Tuesday, it convened a two-day conference of religious leaders and
political officials from 19 nations, trying to promote Lumbini as
``the fountain of world peace'' and open the way for a torrent of
pilgrims and tourists to this impoverished country of 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The conference began with prayerful chanting, a peace march and
a plea for help. ``His Majesty's government will leave no stone
unturned to cooperate with individuals, organizations and friendly
nations to develop Lumbini into an international complex for all
the world human community,'' Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
promised.
</P>
<P>
   At best, such cooperation has been inconsistent in the past, a
sad matter for many of the devoted. As if working through some
inescapable karmic process, the development of Lumbini seems
required to overcome sorrow, greed, egotism, despair and countless
other human frailties before it can attain its realization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five and a half years ago I found so much jungle that it made
me weep,'' said Thay Huyen Dieu, a Vietnamese scholar who is
building a monastery here. ``This was not the beautiful garden of
scripture. We Buddhist people sometimes talk too much and do very
little. This is what Lumbini needs. People doing, people
believing.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the area may lack well-sculpted gardens, it does not
want for tranquillity. Dawn's first brush strokes come in brilliant
greens and golds. A few bicycle rickshaws plow through powdery
roads. An occasional pair of cranes gracefully swoop across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The spot believed to be Buddha's birthplace is now a modest
excavation site. There are piles of red-brown brick once used in
ancient temples. For Tuesday's occasion, red bunting was hung
across the area. Multicolored streamers swayed with the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Priestly delegates wore robes of brown, maroon or yellow,
depending on their sect. Many also carried small black briefcases,
gifts of the Nepalese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lumbini needs is the right concept,'' said Noritada
Morita, a retired economist with the Asian Development Bank. ``This
is Buddha's birthplace. It has to be a peace-oriented, high-quality
meditation place, not just for Buddhists but for everybody. The
problem with the Nepalese is that they are so nice, they don't how
to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was being so charitable to the Nepalese. This is a
declared Hindu kingdom; upward of 80 percent of the population is
Hindu. And many Buddhists feel that the government's Lumbini
efforts have been half-hearted _ and sometimes even corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word pocket is supposed to be a noun, but here it is also
very often a verb,'' the Rev. Hiroyuki Kawashima of the powerful
Japan Buddhist Federation remarked wryly.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo-based federation has helped finance the archeological
exploration of the site. For centuries after Buddha's death,
Lumbini was a place of pilgrimage. It is described in writings left
by seventh-century travelers. But with the Muslim invasions of the
subcontinent, Lumbini was abandoned as a religious shrine, its
location ceded to uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The village was rediscovered only in 1896, when excavators
unearthed a half-buried pillar in the Nepalese countryside. It had
been left in the third century B.C. by Maurya emperor Ashoka, a
once-fierce warrior tamed by Buddhist compassion. An inscription
claimed the spot to be Buddha's birthplace. The pillar stood near a
destroyed temple that contained a relief sculpture of Maya,
Buddha's mother, giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Little was done to reclaim the site and its relics until 1967
when U Thant of Burma, the secretary-general of the United Nations
and a Buddhist, visited Lumbini. Its neglect distressed him, and,
with his prodding and U.N. funds, an ambitious master plan for
developing the site was created by the Japanese architect Kenzo
Tange.
</P>
<P>
   Tange's plans call for three zones, each a mile square in area:
a lavish garden surrounding the pillar and temple; a place for
monasteries with a canal dividing Buddhism's two main traditions,
the Mahayana and Theravada; a space for tourist accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   To get moving, the project needed infrastructure, something hard
to come by in a nation where most people still earn less than $1 a
day. It also required political leadership, which many would say
has also been in short supply. Before democratic reforms, Nepal was
ruled by its royal family from 1960 to 1990. Since then, there have
been a succession of failed coalition governments _each one making
its own political appointments to a succession of failed Lumbini
development committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to make plans when people know you won't be
around for long and they cannot believe what you say,'' said Ram
Lal Shrestha, a recently departed head of the Lumbini staff. ``Then
there is the problem of the master plan. It is too ambitious for
us. So we build a library, for instance _ who is going to pay to
operate the air-conditioning?''
</P>
<P>
   At present, perhaps only 20 percent of the original master plan
has made it off the drawing board. A handful of monasteries are
complete, deep set into the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   Archeological work goes on. Three years ago, in the temple ruins
near the pillar, a reddish-brown slab was found in a position that
indicated it had been left as a marker. The stone was alien to the
area, and Nepalese scholars have concluded that it denotes the
precise location _ down to the inch _ of Buddha's birth. Other
scholars are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, it cannot be determined _ and I don't think
there is any way to ever know for sure,'' said Hiroyuki Kawashima
of the Japan Buddhist Federation.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the present sluggishness made this a wise time for
the Nepalese government to solicit help. The U.N. Development
Program has agreed to review the master plan and consult on future
management of the project. Donors have said they would be more
inclined to contribute to Lumbini if ledger books are kept open and
politics kept out.
</P>
<P>
   In the few Lumbini monasteries, among some of the monks drinking
tea, there is impatience: Why has it taken so long to pay the
proper respect to Lord Buddha? When will millions come to this
place and learn of its peace?
</P>
<P>
   But other monks are undisturbed by such things. ``Why would
anyone hurry to create gardens and buildings and monuments?'' they
ask, echoing the Buddha in reply:
</P>
<P>
   Everything is transient and nothing endures.

FAME CALLS BACK, AND A PROGRAMMER GETS A GIG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By BEN SISARIO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Terry Callier, the long road back to playing a
gig in New York began with a mysterious phone call from London
eight years ago. A record producer told him excitedly that a song
he had recorded in 1982 was a hit in London clubs, and he was eager
to reissue it. It was Callier's first inkling of a reborn career
that now includes a new album, a song of his remade by a
best-selling vocal group and his first New York performance in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Callier is to appear Wednesday night at the club Shine in lower
Manhattan. The last time he appeared in New York, in 1973, he was a
local phenomenon in his hometown, Chicago, while critics were
praising his poetic, innovative amalgam of folky guitar, soul
fervor and jazzy improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   But his music eluded radio formats and marketing categories, and
within a decade he quit music entirely and devoted himself to his
family and his job as a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990 when Eddie Piller of the Acid Jazz label called him for
permission to reissue ``I Don't Want to See Myself (Without You),''
Callier's music had been rediscovered by a new generation of fans
in England. His records were fast becoming collectors' items, and
British dance producers were sampling his old songs.
</P>
<P>
   More calls came, and eventually he was invited to perform
abroad. Slipping away from his job on weekends and vacations,
Callier played occasional gigs in England that were attended by
hundreds and even thousands of admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible,'' he said. ``It was like a dream. A couple
of times I had to stop the show because it was just too over the
top emotionally for me to continue. People knew all the words to my
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   After each concert, Callier headed back to Chicago, where he is
still a programmer at the National Opinion Resource Center, an
affiliate of the University of Chicago that processes
social-science survey data for the government, universities and
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest fans is Beth Orton, a rising young British
singer, who saw him perform at the Jazz Cafe in London. ``There was
a real feeling of community at those concerts,'' she said. ``You
were surrounded by hundreds of others who loved Terry's music, and
it was like you were members of a secret society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orton introduced herself backstage, and eventually Callier
joined her to record two songs for a single, one by Callier and the
other by one of his main influences, Fred Neil; they also recorded
an original by Ms. Orton, and it will appear on her next album.
</P>
<P>
   Callier's renaissance continued with his first new album in 19
years, ``TimePeace,'' released by Verve in February, and on
Wednesday night, Callier will perform at Shine, 285 West Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest turn in a career that has peaked several times,
most notably in the mid-'70s when he made a string of innovative
albums that ignored stylistic boundaries. Critics have struggled to
define his style, calling it folk-jazz, soul-folk and even
folk-soul-jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But Callier, now 53, says he does not believe in such labels.
His music, he says, is simply a personal statement. ``What I've
always done is try to write songs that speak about the relationship
between one person and another, and between one person and a group
of people, maybe society or family, and the relationship between a
person and the Creator. Because that's all there is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He began his musical career in a rush, cutting his first single
before he was out of high school and his first album two years
later. At 19, he was transforming folk standards into evocative
jazz, and he was fusing influences that had surrounded him since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved by folk music and the warmth of Fred Neil's
baritone, but the greatest influence on his life and music was
seeing John Coltrane and his quartet perform in 1964. He said he
was so shocked by the experience that it took him nearly a year
before he could play in public again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was pretty into what I was doing, but they showed
me what `into it' was all about,'' he said. ``I knew that if I
didn't have some of that intensity, some of that commitment, some
of that dignity in my own presentation, I might as well find
something else to do for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   When he reappeared, he sang sweet soul songs tinged with jazz,
accompanied by a folky acoustic guitar. ``In a world of aggression
and attitude, Terry is a very gentle person,'' said Samuel
Charters, who produced Callier's first solo album in 1964. ``His
music is out of step.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s Callier hooked up with a childhood friend,
Jerry Butler, who sang with Curtis Mayfield in the Impressions and
was a successful solo artist. Callier became a salaried songwriter
for Butler's Chicago Songwriters' Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   There he began to experiment with pop forms and orchestration,
aided by Charles Stepney, a producer who later worked with Earth,
Wind and Fire, and with Chaka Khan and others, and had arranged
Callier's first single, ``Look at Me Now,'' in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Callier and Stepney ``were just two talented men working
together,'' said Butler, who entered politics and is now a Cook
County supervisor. ``They had empathy for each other's talent and
feel for each other's music.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepney became a mentor for Callier and other members of the
workshop, and under his guidance Callier wrote a Top 10
rhythm-and-blues hit for the Dells in 1971, ``The Love We Had
(Stays on My Mind),'' a long, elaborately arranged song that pushed
the boundaries of the single format. Callier describes it today as
a ballad-concerto. The song is now on a Top 10 single, as the
B-side to the hit single ``How Deep Is Your Love'' by the vocal
group Dru Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On three albums for the Cadet label in the '70s, ``Occasional
Rain,'' ``What Color Is Love'' and ``I Just Can't Help Myself,''
Callier and Stepney worked out complex textures that set gentle
acoustic guitar over muted soul arrangements. In the lyrics,
Callier addressed social ills on a personal scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing Girl,'' a nine-minute song that wanders from a lone
acoustic guitar to rich orchestration, slowly reveals that the
dancer is selling her body to provide for her child. In other
songs, like ``Trance on Sedgewick Street,'' he treats racial
strife, singing ``Despair will kick your gate in, black and white
are hatin'/While the money makers havin' fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Callier revisited the theme of racial tension on his latest
album, saying in ``Traitor to the Race'' that ``brothers kill more
brothers than the KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of genre continued to dog Callier. ``Is `The Love
We Had (Stays on My Mind)' a folk song?'' Butler asked. ``Probably,
if you just heard him sing it with his guitar, it would have been
classified as a folk song. By the time Charles Stepney got through
with it and the Dells started singing it, it was an R-and-B
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Callier's penchant for social criticism put him in the company
of other leading R-and-B singers of the day, like Mayfield, Marvin
Gaye and Stevie Wonder. But Callier's style remained idiosyncratic
and uncommercial. Without the guidance of Stepney, who died in 1976
as the two were to begin work on a fourth LP, Callier was lost.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the '70s with two albums for Elektra, but he says he
was ignored by management, and by the early '80s he was left
without a contract. In 1982 he recorded a swan song, ``I Don't Want
to See Myself (Without You),'' that he financed himself, and soon
retired from music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I totally stopped playing was between '85 and
'88, when I was concentrating on school,'' Callier said. ``I just
didn't have time to pick up my guitar.'' In 1988 he completed his
bachelor's degree in sociology from North Park University in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no regrets about the past: ``I feel very blessed
for my success. Everything happens in its own time, and it happened
when I could handle it. I didn't have to bend myself out of shape
to make a living, I got a position in computer programming, and I
put my daughter through college. It couldn't have been any
better.''

CHINA ARRESTS TWO DISSIDENTS OUT TO FORM OPPOSITION PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Two of China's most prominent dissidents were suddenly
arrested for criminal offenses on Monday evening in an apparent
crackdown on their efforts to form China's first opposition
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, Xu Wenli, of Beijing, and Qin Yongmin,
from the southern city of Wuhan, had been involved in a small and
loose nationwide network of political activists who have become
increasingly bold in their efforts to start what they call the
China Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The two are longtime dissidents, each of whom has spent over a
decade in jail for pro-democracy views and is accustomed to police
surveillance, occasional house searches and trips to the public
security bureau for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But relatives and human rights groups both agreed that Monday's
arrests were unusual and far more ominous. In Beijing 20 officers
from the Public Security Bureau burst into Xu's home at 9 p.m. on
Monday with a detention form. They arrested Xu and spent the next
three hours searching his house, confiscating his computer, fax
machine, telephone, address book and various other documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third time this year they've come here but from
their attitude, I think it was much more serious this time,'' He
Xintong, Xu's wife, said. ``The other times they just took the fax.
This time there were more officers and they were in more military
uniforms. And they searched much more closely than they did before
_ they even looked under the beds and in closets and they took
phone receipts and bank transaction forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He is still waiting to be notified of the charges against
Xu.
</P>
<P>
   But Qin's family told a human rights group that Public Security
officials notified them that he was being charged with
``threatening state security,'' a grab bag of criminal charges that
often carry sentences of three to 10 years. But sentences under
those charges can be longer if the accused is considered a leader
in serious anti-government activity.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Democratic Party members were also arrested on
Monday, said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fledgling China Democratic Party was not
specifically mentioned in any of the arrests, it was clearly the
ultimate target. All of the men have been involved in repeated
unsuccessful efforts to register the party with Chinese authorities
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. He said that when the police that ransacked Xu's home
``found things related to the China Democratic Party, they went
through them very carefully and then took them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have not commented directly on the party. But
just last week, Li Peng, the former prime minister and leader of
the National People's Congress, pointedly told the German financial
newspaper Handelsblatt that groups that ``seek a multiparty system
and try to negate the leadership of the Communist Party will not be
allowed to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The China Democratic Party has been a persistent source of
irritation and anxiety for the Chinese leaders, an ever-buzzing
mosquito whose bite is probably harmless but that is rarely silent
and never seems to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Its members are dissidents from more than a dozen Chinese
cities. In one city or another they have had almost weekly run-ins
with the authorities as they have tried time and again to gain some
official recognition for the party, mostly by trying to register it
with local officials. Party members have also tried to run in
village elections.
</P>
<P>
   It has carried out a small, but remarkably concerted and
coordinated effort in a country that normally takes great pains to
isolate its political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Democratic Party's efforts to gain recognition have
been successful, and many have resulted in brief detentions by the
local police and warnings that the party is illegal. But members
like Xu and Qin have been unwilling to take no for an answer and
when they hit one dead end, they back up and head out in another
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party is effectively the only political party in
China, and there had been no new parties allowed since the founding
the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some members are undertaking hunger strikes to protest the
detention of party members in distant cities. In late October Xu
theatrically announced that he was planning to set off on a drive
from Beijing to eastern Shandong Province to show support for a
party member there whose wife had been dismissed and whose phone
and electricity had been turned off by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, long after they had been warned by local authorities
that their pursuits were pointless and illegal, 53 Democratic Party
members _ including Xu and Qin _ jointly applied to China's central
State Council for permission to work on forming a new party, said
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China. The Information Center, a Hong Kong human rights group,
sends out almost daily messages on the party's detentions and
releases.
</P>
<P>
   The party, whose by-laws support democratic ideals from election
of officials to free speech, maintains that the Chinese
Constitution does not specifically forbid alternate political
parties. Its organizers add that since China signed the
International Covenant on Political and Human Rights this fall, the
government should let the activists have their say, as respectful
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   China's Criminal Code, under which Qin is charged, goes a long
way to insure that new political parties never get off the ground.
A chapter that is called ``Threatening State Security'' lists as
crimes, ``violent or nonviolent activities aimed at overthrowing
government authorities,'' ``activities designed to change the basic
nature of the state,'' and ``the overthrow of the socialist
system.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how such laws will be applied to the activists
arrested this week. Indeed, Wang Youcai, a former student leader
who was the first Democratic Party organizer to be detained for his
work, was arrested in July on similar charges. Wang was released
two months later to a relaxed sort of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 2, police in his native Hangzhou took him away once
again, for violating the terms of his release, said his wife, Hu
Zhangxia, in a telephone interview. And, just Tuesday, as other
Democratic party colleagues waited to learn of their fate, Ms. Hu
said she was finally notified by the police that her husband had
been formally arrested and was once again in the Public Security
Detention Center.

HOWARD EMMONS, 86; INFLUENCED STUDY OF FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.J.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howard W. Emmons, a retired professor of engineering at Harvard
University known by some as the ``the father of fire science,''
died of complications of liver cancer Nov. 20 in Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 86 and resided in Lexington,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Emmons's early research focused on the firestorms that
engulfed German cities after Allied air raids during World War II.
His application of the principles of high-temperature plasma
dynamics to the spread of fire led to the development of computer
models of building fires.
</P>
<P>
   Those models contributed to the understanding of disasters such
as the fire in the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas in 1980 and had
many implications for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Academy of Science's committee on
fire research, he was influential in the passage of the National
Fire Research and Safety Act of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Morristown, N.J., he graduated from Stevens Institute of
Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and earned a doctorate at Harvard
University in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career he worked on the design of jet engines. He
first described the phenomena of turbulence in fluids, which became
known as Emmons's turbulent spot.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former resident of Sudbury, where he was chairman of
the School Committee for many years. He was also a member of the
town's Board of Selectmen from 1969 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from teaching in 1983, he continued
research. In June he presented a technical paper at the 14th
meeting of the joint US-Japan Panel on Fire Research and Safety in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a daughter, Beverly, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; two sons,
Scott W., also of Brooklyn, and Keith of Los Gatos, Calif.; and
three grandchildren.

A VETERAN AT 27, THOMAS ADES MAY ONLY BE STARTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Great Britain)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
(mk) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the second act of Thomas Ades' opera ``Powder Her
Face,'' which opens at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy
of Music on Tuesday, the central character _ a duchess, anonymous
but based on the Duchess of Argyll who gave Britain some widely
enjoyed scandal in the 1950s _ is being interviewed. She will not,
she says, speak about certain ``matters'': matters the opera has
already disclosed, including the rapid social ascent that her money
gained her and the lurid divorce that came when she was revealed to
be treating male servants and hotel employees with too much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   She does warm up when she realizes that the ``secrets'' the
journalist wants are those of her success, but then is led by her
own eloquence into making a stream of unhealthy remarks about
modern society. These the journalist seems not to notice, being too
busy taking down the beauty tips she has confided: ``Always wash in
cold water,'' ``Cold cream is best for the maturer skin.'' But who
knows what will appear in print?
</P>
<P>
   Ades does not take such risks anymore. Having seen his
personality evaporate, leaving unrecognizable shadows on the pages
of newspapers and magazines, he has called a halt. His reticence is
understandable. Though only 27, he has been relentlessly acclaimed
in his native Britain for nearly a decade, and the appetite for his
music is now international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powder Her Face,'' which was first performed three years ago
at the Cheltenham Festival in England, has since been seen at the
Aspen Music Festival in a production on which the semistaged
version to be presented by BAM and the Brooklyn Philharmonic is
based. Further stagings are to follow next year in Europe and
Australia. Most of the young composer's output is already available
on three EMI albums, and performances of his smaller works are
everywhere, with attendant publicity. Everyone wants a piece of
him. But the only pieces he wants to give, at this point, are his
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   To quote the duchess again: ``Ev'rything now is solitude,
ev'ryone is alone.'' The irony is, though, that Ades has been
driven to isolation so that he can safeguard his ability to
communicate publicly and to challenge, through his music, a social
disintegration that he seems to regret as much as his duchess does.
A lot of his work so far has been in chamber music, in ideal little
societies of collaboration. ``Catch,'' one of his earliest pieces
(dating all the way back to 1991), makes the point dramatically: a
piano trio, seated onstage in the normal way, lures a passing
lone-wolf clarinetist to take a place in its midst.
</P>
<P>
   Ades is clearly concerned, too, about how and why musicians and
audiences sit down together. In his most recent big piece, the
symphonic ``Asyla,'' which had its first performance under Simon
Rattle just over a year ago, the search is on for places of safety
(as the title denotes), where ears can join with other ears. Ades
has noted the marginal place accorded new work in the current
musical world, and he does not like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asyla'' sounds like a quest for music with which we can all
feel comfortable again, but music that is not just reiteration of
the past or reiteration, period. The third movement is a ferocious
assault of mindless repetition and a ferocious outcry against it,
hugely powerful and disturbing. In other passages, the music
beautifully and tricklingly cavorts in the upper treble, in
textures and harmonies that are already identifiably Adesian. This
is one asylum he has won, but it is small, and he wants more.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess, for her part, has very different ideas about what
one can expect of and for oneself and what one should do for other
people. ``Society'' is the name of a club to which most of us do
not belong. Perfume, furs, champagne and parties help make the
world tolerable. Mostly, one does not ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   It is this lack of self-observation, or indeed, of any evident
interior life, that makes the duchess such an enigmatic but also
compelling operatic creature. There can be few other leading opera
characters who enjoy themselves so little. She sings a lot, but she
is in command of what she sings only when she is giving
instructions. In her fellatio aria, necessarily sung on ``mm,''
``ng'' and ``ugh'' sounds, she communicates only the most
generalized and automatic excitement. She is absent. And
ultimately, she gains a kind of dignity in her absence, fully
expressed in her final lament and withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Ades accords her this dignity by his refusal of easy satire. The
popular idioms he evokes _ the tango that starts the opera and
often comes back, a wonderful '30s-style song for crooning _ are
re-created with as much fastidious workmanship as everything else
in the score, and with no camp anxiety. He must love this music as
much as the duchess does. Probably he loves champagne as much as
she does, too.
</P>
<P>
   His opera is not really about the follies and iniquities of the
idle rich. Rather, it is about a more widespread problem, that of
finding things about which to care and in which to trust. The
duchess, caring for her appearance and trusting in nothing,
nevertheless retains a nobility, which Ades' music for her
reinforces. Degraded in her behavior and stupid in her beliefs, she
is still admirable for harboring no pretensions. She is not
assailed by the drama, which is somewhere between Jean Genet and
English bedroom farce. Meanwhile, the score, of which she also
remains sublimely oblivious, juggles around her with magical and
gorgeous musical notions, and its circumspectness is sweet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quality of the piece comes across strongly in the new EMI
recording. A crack instrumental band, conducted by the composer,
swaggers with expressiveness and virtuoso craft. The vocal writing
proves sharply pointed, whether in pithy phrases or glorious
extended melodies. In the central role, Jill Gomez sings with
perfect poise, and there are excellent performances by Valdine
Anderson and Niall Morris, both sounding young, fun-loving and
vulnerable as the hotel employees who take on various parts in
enacting the charade of the duchess' career.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other two EMI albums, they show that there was reason
for the adulation Ades' earlier music won. ``Living Toys,'' for the
usual modern-music ensemble of soloists, is unusual as a strikingly
brilliant array of memorable inventions, evoking angels, dancers,
soldiers and ancient cattle. The string quartet ``Arcadiana'' is a
similarly fresh set of images that appeal this time, hauntingly or
menacingly, to musical locations from Astor Piazzolla's Argentina
to Edward Elgar's England. ``Under Hamelin Hill'' tells the Pied
Piper story in goblinlike music for a chamber organ.
</P>
<P>
   But the best piece here is the one written since the opera:
``Traced Overhead,'' a piano solo, superbly performed by the
composer. Within a context of rippling figurations in the upper
treble, it includes a humorous section that knocks chords off their
regular rhythmic and harmonic perches to place them in precarious
new balances, and later it uses the instrument's ability, when
certain combinations of notes are played, to sound high harmonics
way beyond the top of the keyboard. As in other Ades pieces,
descending chromatic scales tell one exactly what to expect, but
not when and how to expect it. Here they also contribute strongly
to the combination of melancholy and joy.
</P>
<P>
   With the added example of ``Asyla,'' and with the promise of a
new opera for Covent Garden and a big piece for the New York
Philharmonic, it may be that Ades' real work is only now beginning.

 &HT;    BUSH WRAPS UP VISIT TO ISRAEL
 &HT;    EDs: Bush is scheduled to leave at 5 p.m. EST (1 a.m. Tel Aviv
time).

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush was wrapping up his first
visit to Israel Tuesday night, after a helicopter tour that edged
slightly into the highly-sensitive world of peace process politics.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli government official, who asked not to be identified,
said that a request of U.S. Embassy officials prompted Bush and
three other Republican governors to cancel short visits to two
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements, Jewish neighborhoods spread throughout the
largely-Arab West Bank, are a source of controversy in the peace
process. Palestinians view them as encroaching on their land, which
was captured by Israel in 1967. Many Israelis believe that the
settlements help protect the country's security.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have asked that Israel stop expanding settlements
and occasionally ask visiting dignitaries to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Jewish Coalition, a Republican Party group that
supports the settlement policies of Israel's right-wing government,
organized the three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   The group would not release schedules, but an Israeli government
schedule listed two 15-minute stops at settlements that are often
used as observation points over the West Bank. The schedule
included no meetings with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians claimed that the visits, especially because of
Bush's potential candidacy for the president, would be used by the
Israelis as a small validation of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter tour did not make the stops Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter did touch down briefly at another settlement
where Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who was leading the tour, left
the group to board another helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tuesday, the group visited an Israeli Aircraft Industries
plant, toured the area around the Sea of Galilee and, further
north, the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the focus of attention from Israeli officials but has
repeatedly declined to make anything but brief comments to the
press during the trip. He has said he would hold his remarks for a
press conference in Austin, Texas, on Thursday. The group was
expected to leave Israel on a late-night flight Tuesday.

ANTIPASTI THAT LOOK GOOD, AT LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some cookbook authors are one-hit wonders. They come out with
one big splashy book, then fall off the map, presumably retreating
to their home kitchens and making local cooking appearances. Others
are like Lorenza de'Medici, who has produced more than twenty books
during her lengthy career. To most cookbook collectors, she is the
familiar name to which they are unable to put a face. ``She has
pretty books,'' they might remark.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, many of her books are beautiful _ large and
impressive, laden with pictures. They are so visual that if you
place them side by side, you will have a better review of the
progress of food photography over the past decade than you will
have of the progress of Italian cooking over these years.
</P>
<P>
   This is how I know Ms. de'Medici's books. I had never cooked
from them. With the publication of ``Lorenza's Antipasti''
(Clarkson Potter, $40), I decided it was time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de'Medici begins this latest book with a history of
antipasti that feels a bit like a sports recap on the news. You get
a small hit of antipasti examples from Roman times to the present,
without much sense of Italy's important regional differences. There
are great prints and photos in this section, but unfortunately, no
captions describing what they are or where they come from.
</P>
<P>
   I moved on to the recipes and I quickly learned why no one I
know cooks from Ms. de'Medici's books. The recipes simply aren't
that good, if they work at all, and they are filled with errors,
vague instructions and ingredients out of order.
</P>
<P>
   The best antipasto I made was a bruschetta with sausages, which
tasted delicious. It was essentially a ragu spread on toast, and
the recipe yielded enough to coat both the bruschetta and spaghetti
for a family of four. I dismissed it as a minor proportion error,
figuring it was better to have too much than too little.
</P>
<P>
   The fig and goat cheese tart, which I had been dreaming about
for days, on the other hand, turned out to be a disaster. My first
try at the pastry failed completely: it was all crumbs. The second
time, I added half a stick more butter, more milk and a second egg
yolk. It worked, but it was now  &UR; my  &LR; recipe, not Ms. de'Medici's.
And because both the cheese filling and the pastry needed salt, the
resulting tart was bland. I ended up picking off the figs and
eating them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Matters did not improve. Chickpea focaccias with rosemary were
more like chewy crepes, and cheese and pear truffles made with
gorgonzola and mascarpone cheese amounted to, well, cheese balls.
They were far too rich for an antipasto.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I was annoyed with Ms. de'Medici, but what really
did it was a recipe on the same page as the cheese balls. It was
for white truffles with pancetta. They were the only two
ingredients. If I could actually afford white truffles, I thought,
I certainly wouldn't trust this book to tell me how to cook them.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to answer all my questions about Ms. de'Medici's
book. So I stopped cooking.
</P>
<P>
   BRUSCHETTA WITH SAUSAGES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Lorenza's Antipasti'' by Lorenza de'Medici &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces sweet Italian sausages
</P>
<P>
   7 ounces boneless pork, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more for brushing
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe plum tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   10 large 1/2-inch thick slices coarse country bread.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel the sausages and crumble the meat into a medium bowl.
Add the pork. In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat.
Add the carrot, celery and onion and cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes, or until the onion is
translucent. Stir in the sausage and pork and cook for another 3
minutes. Add the fennel seeds, tomatoes, wine and thyme. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low
and cook the ragu for about 1 hour, stirring from time to time and
adding a little water if necessary to keep moist.
</P>
<P>
   2. Uncover the pan and let the juices evaporate completely.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the bread slices
on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes, or
until barely golden, turning them once. Brush with olive oil and
arrange on individual dishes. Spread with the sausage ragu and
serve immediately while still very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 appetizer servings.

NRA SUES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, SEEKS DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS OF PEOPLE
BUYING FIREARMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A gun rights group is suing the Justice Department
to force it to destroy records of people buying firearms
immediately after they are cleared by a new instant criminal
background check system that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new computerized system is the second phase of the Brady
law, a bill passed in 1993 that required a five-day waiting period
to conduct a criminal background check for all handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   This second phase now requires federally licensed dealers to
call an FBI record center with the name and other information of
anyone purchasing a handgun or any rifle or shotgun. FBI staff at
the West Virginia center then conduct an ``instant'' criminal
background check using several national criminal databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration, acting through (Attorney General)
Janet Reno's Justice Department, has now twisted implementation of
the system into a national surveillance system that puts a higher
priority on tracking gun purchases by law-abiding citizens than it
does on the arrest and prosecution of those who attempt to violate
our federal firearms laws,'' said James Jay Baker of the National
Rifle Association, the organization leading the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, along with several individuals and another gun rights
organization, said Tuesday that portions of the Brady law require
the FBI to destroy records of the firearms purchase after it tells
a dealer to proceed with a sale.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI and Justice Department officials said records are kept
on file for six months only ``to perform audits of the system to
protect the privacy of gun owners and detect fraud and abuse of the
system,'' said Paul Bresson, FBI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The audits will serve as a track record of how the database is
used, to make sure employees at the database center are not
misusing records and to make sure dealers only do checks on people
buying firearms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI must publish suggestions for a shorter record retention
period in the Federal Register in February, and make an official
announcement by May, said Jim Kessler, program manager for the
National Instant Check System (NICS) in Clarksburg, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory King, a Justice Department spokesman, responded to the
lawsuit's contentions by saying: ``We're reviewing the NRA suit and
we believe our policy of retaining records of approved firearms
purchases for a very limited period of time is consistent with
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to protect the security of the system and
the privacy of gun purchasers. We will respond to the suit in court
early next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits convicted felons, the mentally incompetent
and those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from buying
firearms. Some states have more restrictive conditions and any
waiting periods states impose will remain in place. Texas law
enforcement agencies have converted to the federal system.
</P>
<P>
   Most background checks will receive a ``proceed'' or ``deny''
response within a few minutes, FBI officials have said. If a
``delay'' order is given and the dealer gets no other information
within three days, the sale is approved automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Once a purchaser passes the background check, the law orders the
FBI to assign an identification number to that particular purchase,
which is also given to the dealer to put with the record of sale.
According to the text of the NRA lawsuit, the next step in the law
reads: ``destroy all records of the system with respect to the call
... and all records of the system relating to the person or the
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the statutory issue, the records constitute an
invasion of privacy, said Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any American. They don't believe the government ought to
keep a centralized list of names and addresses of law abiding
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy groups also expressed concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Solange Bitol of the national American Civil Liberties Union
said the ACLU has not examined this particular issue and lawsuit,
but it has a general policy against the government having a giant
database about citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, this is government intruding into the lives of
individuals,'' Bitol said. &QL;

WHEN TO DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It happens more often than people like to admit. We
are helpless in dealing with the last illness of loved ones who
desperately need a legitimate way to ease the suffering and bring
some dignity to the process of dying.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want them to leave us. But they may be ready to go.
When death is hopelessly imminent, we do not stop caring. But we
watch silently as they suffer with pain that could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   This is difficult to talk about because the Catholic Church is
the leader of a movement preaching that euthanasia without
exception is a sin and that dying must be left strictly up to fate.
It is important to consider questions of ethics and morality.
Euthanasia inevitably stirs unreasonable fears that children may
murder their parents or doctors may murder their patients for
having, say, a bad cold.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a concept that is easier honored in the abstract than
during the tortured months preceding the death of a relative or
friend who is needlessly in agony and wishes release.
</P>
<P>
   My late husband, suffering from kidney failure and other
ailments, asked me a few months before he died to help him leave
painlessly with dignity. ``This is no life,'' he whispered on his
hospital bed. I could not muster the courage to do as he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over I have heard similar stories, told with love and
regret, from families who have coped with the misery of terminally
ill loved ones and are horrified by suffering that seems
unnecessarily prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced medical technology can often keep people breathing for
no real purpose, long after they have passed into a vegetative
state.
</P>
<P>
   Administering morphine and other pain-killing medication can
ease one agony but cause another, sending the patient into a coma
or mental confusion. And there are legal restrictions on its usage.
</P>
<P>
   As my 93-year-old mother moaned in pain caused by cancer, I had
an angry exchange with her doctor (well, I yelled at him) because
he refused to increase her morphine dosage. He contended it might
slow her breathing and hasten her death. Breathing slowly anyway,
she died two days later, still in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kevorkian is a controversial figure because he seems
unhealthily obsessed with suicide as the ultimate solution.
</P>
<P>
   And he often goes to extremes to get attention, as he did when
he mailed CBS's ``60 Minutes'' a videotape of his latest assisted
suicide, during which he administered a lethal injection that
killed a disabled victim of Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevorkian's basic crusade to win support for an enlightened
legal and political system that would allow the terminally ill to
choose the method and the timing of their death is a just one. We
may be uncomfortable about the messenger, but the message is
crucial to a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   His latest publicity stunt succeeded spectacularly. Some 22
million people watched the CBS show, its biggest audience of the
season. CBS has been criticized for exploiting a death for the sake
of ratings, but I think it was a public service. Nobody who was
offended was forced to watch. We need to confront this whole
subject and debate it.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan prosecutor promptly charged Kevorkian with
first-degree murder, setting up a trial that will test a new state
law that heartlessly prohibits anyone from assisting in a suicide.
Defending the law, a euthanasia opponent observed coldly that
rather than seek suicide, the disabled man could have ``stopped
eating or drinking'' _ adding another level of heightened suffering
_ if he wished to die.
</P>
<P>
   Polls over the years show that a majority of Americans are
compassionate toward the dying and want to find legitimate ways to
ease suffering and pain, including assisted suicide if justified. A
CBS poll following the ``60 Minutes'' videotape found that 52
percent of those surveyed approved of doctor-assisted suicide and
37 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has already been tried four times for murder in
Michigan for helping the terminally ill to die. In three cases,
sympathetic juries acquitted him, and once there was a mistrial.
This time he faces not only a tough new law but the fact that he
actually administered the lethal medicine rather than giving it to
the patient to self-administer.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the law and common sense is being tested in
other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, a Louisville, Ky., woman named Michele Finn
asked care givers at a Virginia nursing home, where her husband
Hugh was in a persistent vegetative state, to withdraw his feeding
tube. Mrs. Finn has my sympathy because I have known friends kept
technically alive by feeding tubes who were not alive in any other
sense. It is horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III intervened, filing suit in a
circuit court to prevent Mrs. Finn from controlling decisions about
her husband's medical care. The judge tossed Gilmore's suit out of
court, called the intervention frivolous and ordered the state to
pay much of her legal costs. The judge further told Gilmore to
express his views on euthanasia in the political arena instead of
the courts. Hugh Finn died Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Several states are considering various forms of right-to-die
laws, either through ballot initiatives or legislative measures. So
far, Oregon is the only state with such a law. The Supreme Court
has ruled that assisted suicide is neither constitutionally
protected nor forbidden. It is for the states to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some people are taking matters into their own hands.
Recent news stories have highlighted a new pattern of
homicide-suicide involving elderly couples who are ill, depressed
and unable to cope any longer.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to name Atlanta
body-building champion Lee Haney to the President's Commission on
Physical Fitness and Sports, an administration official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Haney would fill the council seat vacated by the late track
star, Florence ''Flo-Jo'' Joyner, who died earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, 38, won eight consecutive ''Mr. Olympia'' world
body-building titles before retiring from competition to run
commercial fitness centers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is someone who is devoted to improving the physical
fitness of the American people, both by setting an example and by
encouraging others,'' an administration official said, speaking on
background.
</P>
<P>
   The official said he did not know when Clinton would publicly
name Haney to the Council, but said ''It is going to happen. It is
a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner had been the chair of the 20-member council until her
death earlier this year. The administration official said it had
not been determined who would become the next chair of the council,
a presidential body that works to improve the overall fitness of
the nation through an emphasis on sports and other types of
physical activity.

   ISRAEL-BUSH-1202 _ JERUSALEM _ In a helicopter tour led by
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
flew over the West Bank today, but did not touch down to visit
Jewish settlements as initially planned. Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, who advocates keeping control of strategic areas of the
West Bank, played guide for Bush and three other visiting U.S.
governors on a helicopter tour of the disputed territory, Israeli
officials said. An Israeli Foreign Ministry itinerary had listed a
visit to an observation point overlooking the Jewish settlement of
Alfei Menashe _ a spot where Israel's nearby coastal plain can be
seen _ but the helicopter did not put down. (Kaplow, Cox News

Bill Clinton exceeded federal spending limits by $46 million and
Republican Bob Dole exceeded them by $23.4 million, according to
audits released Tuesday by the Federal Election Commission. In
return for receiving federal money, both agreed to spending limits.
Clinton should be required to repay $7 million and Dole to repay
$17.9 million to the U.S. Treasury, the auditors said. Both
campaigns dispute the findings, and the full FEC will start trying
to sort out the dispute Thursday. The reports could influence the
thinking of the GOP-cohntrolled House on whether Clinton should be
impeached for violating campaign finance laws. (Mollison, Cox News

   &QL;  GEKAS DECRIES ``GIGANTIC LEFT WING CONSPIRACY,'' IN
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, December 1, 1998 -- Rep. George W. Gekas,
R-Harrisburg, called Democrats ``part of a gigantic left wing
conspiracy'' for criticizing a vote Tuesday that expanded the
impeachment inquiry to include campaign fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearings, Gekas also said he ``inching closer'' to
voting for impeachment, based on the perjury allegations against
President Clinton involving his testimony in the Paula Jones case
and before the Starr grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Democrats who say we are on a fishing expedition have
rushed to the side of the president without looking at the
evidence,'' Gekas said in an interview. ``They choose to protect
their political leader without even wanting to look at the evidence
... no matter what the evidence would tell them. They have been in
complete harmony that he should be exonerated of all charges right
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me is a left wing conspiracy,'' said Gekas, the only
Pennsylvanian on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members voted 20-15 along party lines to approve
subpoenas for Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh
and others regarding White House involvement in alleged fundraising
abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are wanting to look just a bit farther. We want to look
into anything that came across our desks that holds the possibility
of turning up other impeachable offenses,'' Gekas said. ``There is
no reason we should turn our heads to new evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas will seek evidence, including internal memos, used
by the Justice Department in its fundraising investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee decried Republicans for expanding the
scope of the inquiry weeks before it is slated to wrap up.
</P>
<P>
   But Gekas said he would vote to conclude the aspect of the
inquiry pertaining to Monica S. Lewinsky by the end of the month,
but continue the campaign finance inquiry next year if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has said he
still wants to wrap up the inquiry by Christmas, and take a vote on
possible impeachment articles against Clinton. One or more of those
articles will deal with perjury, which was the focus of Tuesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses testified about the criminal punishment they faced
after being convicted of commiting perjury in civil cases, and
other legal experts testified about whether Clinton should be held
to the same standard as anyone convicted of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas said he believes Clinton might have to face such stiff
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very close to considering perjury, or giving false
statements under oath to a grand jury, if it is an impeachable
offense,'' Gekas said. ``If perjury is one of the articles of
impeachment, I lean toward supporting that article of
impeachment.''

RESEARCHERS FIND TRANSMISSION OF DEFECTIVE GENE TO CHILDREN BORN
THROUGH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston and San Antonio researchers have for the first
time documented the transmission of a defective gene to children
born as a result of in vitro fertilization using a donated egg.
</P>
<P>
   The rare genetic defect called ocular albinism reduces the
clarity of vision, said Dr. Richard Lewis, professor of
ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The report,
published in this month's edition of the journal Fertility and
Sterility, documents that one male child actually has the disorders
and two girls received the mutated gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's a rare event, those people involved in the ovum
donor programs need to be exceedingly careful to prevent the
unintended transmission of a genetic disease,'' said Lewis, who
consulted on the case and is one of the authors of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Previous abnormalities in children born as a result of in vitro
fertilization have occurred as a result of spontaneous mutation,
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees in life,'' said Mark Rothstein,
director of the University of Houston Health Law and Policy
Institute. ``People need to realize that there are spontaneous
mutations as well. Even if you screen for everything under the sun,
something could happen of a genetic or nongenetic nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The children involved were born as a result of in vitro
fertilization involving eggs donated by a 24-year-old woman through
the Ooctye Donor Program at the University of Texas Health Science
Center at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The woman went through all the screenings recommended by the
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the screenings are not sufficient to identify all
genetic disorders, particularly those like this one that are
extremely rare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four children were born as a result of the woman's oocyte
donations, including one set of twins.
</P>
<P>
   The boy twin's parents became concerned that his eyes appeared
to shift and that he could not focus properly on an object at age 2
months.
</P>
<P>
   Examination by Lewis and a pediatric ophthalmologist in San
Antonio confirmed that the boy had ocular albinism. In its most
severe forms, ocular albinism can leave a person legally blind.
This child, now about 5 years old, has reduced vision but will be
able to function and read, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the twins' birth, two other pregnancies
resulted from the egg donations by this woman.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests of the youngsters found that the boy did have the
gene for the X-linked disease. His twin did not carry the mutated
gene, and she is free of disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two other girls born to two different sets of
parents carry a single mutated gene.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disease is X-linked, the mutation affects only boys
who carry it. However, the girls could possible transmit the
disease to their offspring, when they are old enough to have
children.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned further, the woman who donated the egg remembered
that an optometrist once told her that there was funny pigment in
her retina, which is typical of women who carry the gene mutation,
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests confirmed that the woman carried the defective
gene, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many couples seek egg donation because the wife
carries a genetic disease that could be passed on to an offspring.
However, identifying extremely rare conditions such as this one in
egg donors will be extremely difficult. &QL;

TEXAS RULES ALCOHOL VENDING MACHINES ILLEGAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Beer drinkers in Texas will have to keep getting their
brews the old-fashioned way after a state attorney general's
opinion declaring that high-tech vending machines that dispense
booze are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The legal opinion, sought by the administrator of the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission, means that adult beverage machines
that had been placed at private golf courses in the Dallas area
will have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had agreed in June to allow installation of the
machines, but a state representative and an official with Mothers
Against Drunk Driving protested the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Their protest was based on the state's Alcoholic Beverage Code,
which states that coin-operated machines or ``similar devices'' may
not be used to sell alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma City company had argued that its machines, which
dispense drinks when a customer enters a personal identification
number, are not covered by the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The state Alcoholic Beverage Commission sought the attorney
general's opinion after state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Texas, and
Vena Cronin, a Houston MADD activist, complained that the agency
was attempting to legislate liquor laws without public involvement
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office, in a Nov. 13 opinion,
agreed with Hochberg and Cronin, stating that it is ``patently
obvious'' that adult beverage machines are similar to coin-operated
machines, and thus prohibited. Hochberg and Cronin, who had feared
the machines could lead to illegal sales to minors, said they are
happy with the attorney general's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the A.G. made an obvious decision in an obvious case
that was obvious to everybody but the TABC,'' Hochberg said
Tuesday. ``It was pretty clear to me what the law said.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cronin: ``We don't need TABC legislating laws that could be
potential problems.'' &QL;

ISRAEL FACES DEADLINE TO INTEGRATE RELIGIOUS COUNCILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For years, the Israeli government has resisted court
orders to place Reform and Conservative Jews on the all-Orthodox,
taxpayer-financed religious councils that wield tremendous power in
every town and city of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with all appeals exhausted, the Religious Affairs Ministry
faces a Supreme Court deadline to integrate the councils by the end
of December and fierce pressure from Orthodox groups here and in
the United States to defy it. Ultra-Orthodox politicians are so
outraged that they have threatened to bring down the government if
the councils _ which the courts consider administrative rather than
religious bodies _ become ``mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in this pluralism business,'' said Avraham
Ravitz, leader of the United Torah Judaism Party's four-member
faction in parliament. ``Why should we let in the Reform and the
Conservative? To us, it's like if a Lutheran or a Baptist would go
to the Vatican and say, `Hey, we're all Christians.' They would be
thrown down the steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the court order, the newly integrated Jerusalem council,
the country's largest relgious council, must be appointed by
Thursday. The names of the new Tel Aviv and Haifa councils were
published last week. All must be seated by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this is a cultural debate about sectarian
pluralism in a primarily non-Orthodox Jewish society where the
Orthodox control everything from restaurant inspections to marriage
ceremonies, burials and conversions. Just beneath the surface, with
tensions between the secular and the ultra-Orthodox rising, it also
reflects a new anxiety about the close relationship between
religion and the state in the Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fat budgets and bloated staffs of the more than 160
religious councils in Israel, it is also a prosaic political battle
over an inefficient, costly and sometimes corrupt patronage system.
</P>
<P>
   This casts the whole issue in an odd light, since the people
fighting on principle to integrate the councils do not believe they
should exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there should be state-financed religious
councils,'' said Anat Hoffman, a leftist Jerusalem City Council
member who filed the first lawsuit to integrate the councils in
1989. ``If they are financed by the government to provide services,
they should be incorporated into the municipalities. But still, if
they are to exist, then they should be open and democratic and
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   The councils operate as a kind of auxiliary municipality,
providing services affecting both religious and non-religious
people. On the one hand, they sustain the neighborhood synagogues
and ritual baths of the Orthodox. On the other, they control the
marriage bureaus _ Orthodox ceremonies are the only ones recognized
by the state _ and the kosher inspections vital to almost every
restaurant and food shop here. (The ultra-Orthodox privately
maintain a second kosher inspection system, which grants seals
according to their stricter rules.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each city's religious council has two chief rabbis _ one
Ashkenazi and one Sephardic, each with a driver _ and a chairman
who earns the same salary as the deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, where the council meets in a room decorated with
Wailing Wall wallpaper, the chairman takes home about $70,000 a
year, as do his four deputies. The Jerusalem council oversees a $12
million budget for daily operations and development, with 600
kosher inspectors, 50 neighborhood rabbis, 12 ritual butchers, and
23 men charged with checking whether every green grocer has tithed
10 percent of his fruits and vegetables to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline looming, Rabbi Ehud Bandel, the leader of the
Conservative movement in Israel, said he was hopeful but not
optimistic that he would finally be allowed to take his seat on the
Jerusalem council.
</P>
<P>
   ``After almost 10 years of battle, I want to believe that
eventually reason will prevail,'' Bandel said. ``Of course, it is
true that they have not been welcoming. They have in fact used
public funds in order to slander us. Prior to the High Holy Days,
the Jerusalem religious council put paid ads in newspapers warning
the public not to be tempted by the propaganda of the Conservative
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bandel remains hopeful. ``Still, if only we had a chance to
work together, I'm sure they would come to realize that the things
which unite us are far greater than the things that divide us,'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yitzhak Ralbag, the Jerusalem council chairman, sounded
far more skeptical about the possibility of a working relationship.
``Believe me, if one woman or one Reform sat at our council table,
they'd have less to say than I would at Bill Clinton's table,'' he
said, using Reform as a generic term for non-Orthodox. ``So what
does it mean to them? It gives them legitimacy. They sit side by
side with Rabbi Ralbag, who went to the finest, greatest
yeshivas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Orthodox religious leaders and ultra-Orthodox politicians
see the move to integrate the councils as an attack orchestrated by
American Jews, whose non-Orthodox branches of Judaism have, in
their view, assimilated into the Christian world and diluted the
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that sentiment, Agudath Israel of America, an umbrella
organization of Orthodox groups, sent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a sharply worded letter urging him to prevent the
integration of the councils and to avert granting ``official
credibility'' to Reform and Conservative movements. It said that
these movements, given their high rates of assimilation and
intermarriage, ``appear likely to lead to Jewish oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to skirt the High Court's final ruling, some, including
the country's chief Sephardic rabbi, have gone so far as to propose
eliminating the councils altogether, which puts them in accord with
the left. But unlike the left, they would propose turning over the
councils' responsibilities to the rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   In five separate judgments over a 9-year court battled waged by
the Israel Religious Action Center for the Reform movement the
Supreme Court has repeatedly, and unanimously, held that the
government cannot discriminate on the basis of affiliation in
appointing representatives to the religious councils.
</P>
<P>
   In every city, the religious council, appointed by the religion
minister, the local chief rabbi and the municipal council, is
supposed to reflect the make-up of the population. The municipal
representatives are supposed to be nominated by the council
members, mirroring the results of municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   But they have been bastions of power for two Orthodox religious
parties: the National Religious Party and Shas. And, as a Jerusalem
Post editorial calling for the councils' abolition said, they have
also ``played a starring role in the annual State Comptroller's
Report on political patronage, profligate spending and corruption
in governmental institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1987, the councils were not only all Orthodox, but all
male as well. Following a court order, Leah Shakdiel, who is
Orthodox, became the first woman seated on a religious council, in
the tiny town of Yeroham.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after that hurdle was crossed, the leftist Meretz
Party filed suit to place Reform and Conservative Jews as their
representatives on the councils in Jersualem, Tel Aviv and a few
other municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   But the court judgments were consistently sidestepped by the
government, with a few exceptions. Last year, Joyce Brenner, a
social worker and Reform Jew originally from Brooklyn, won a battle
to be seated on the religious council in Netanya. In response, Eli
Suissa, who was then the religion minister, resigned for 24 hours
in protest so that Netanyahu would have to sign the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the appointment, however, it took another court order
to compel the members of the Netanya council to hold a meeting.
They essentially recessed for eight months in order not to sit down
with Dr. Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting was a screaming match. ``They said horrible
things, like it's worse to have you than an Arab, a Muslim, a
Christian,'' Dr. Brenner said. Gradually, though, they got used to
having her around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't dare sit near me,'' she said. ``I sit at one edge
and everyone else at the other. But at least they're polite. They
greet me. They offer me tea. And before the last meeting, one
member actually called me and lobbied for my vote on a particular
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Brenner said she believes most of the council's work
goes on outside the meetings, and that she will never be more than
a minority voice during the formal sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of principle, my presence,'' she said. ``As a
reform Jew and as a watchdog.''

 &HT;    SOME MEMBERS OVERLOOKING SELF-IMPOSED TERM LIMITS
 &HT;    765 words

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years ago, U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts assured voters
in his Oklahoma district, ``I will not serve more than six years''
in Congress. That was before he was re-elected twice and then won
the post of chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now Watts, an ascending star in his party, is not so sure about
his promise to bid Congress adieu after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he alone among lawmakers who since 1992 have been issuing
pledges to limit their terms in response to a national movement to
establish a ``citizen legislature'' in which members would spend a
few years in Washington and then return to their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits, a private group urging tenure limitations at
all levels of government, has pushed for a constitutional amendment
without success and now is focusing on self-imposed limits. That's
the message the group plans to stress Wednesday at a Washington
conference where the featured speaker will be U.S. Rep. Matt
Salmon, R-Ariz., who is making good on his promise not to run again
after his next term.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Congress that will take office in January, 55 House
members and three senators have pledged to limit their terms. But
the true test will come in the year 2000 when 11 House members will
reach their self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 who have said they would depart, five, including
Watts, are wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler had told her Jacksonville, Fla., district
when she was first elected in 1992 that she would stay no longer
than eight years. She has just been elected to be House Republican
Conference vice chairman, and she now is saying she might run for
re-election in 2000, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people had advised me that to be fully effective, it
might take more than a single term'' in her new leadership job,
Fowler said Tuesday. She said she will spend next year getting
``feedback from my constituents'' and assessing whether she needs
an additional term for her House post.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., already has told his district he
plans to renege on his promise to leave after four terms, and he
won re-election last month by 66 percent of the vote. Rep. Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., also has declined to reaffirm his promise to
depart in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disturbing for term-limit advocates is Rep. George
Nethercutt, the Republican who defeated former House Speaker Thomas
Foley in Washington state in 1994 by attacking him for being a
Washington insider and career politician. Now Nethercutt himself
appears to be a bit wobbly on his promise not to run again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the poster child for the movement,'' said Jason Miller,
spokesman for U.S. Term Limits. ``We'll see if he'll make good on
his pledge to the people there or if he'll get a little 'Potomac
fever.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is eyeing a run for governor but keeping his options
open for staying in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an agenda'' of issues to work on, said Ken Lisaius,
spokesman for Nethercutt. ``Really, what he's trying to do is find
the best way to serve Washington state.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional reform movement has seen other troubling signs
this year, including an announcement by the designated new House
Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La., that members deserve an increase in
their $136,700 annual salary, a proposition that runs counter to
the push for temporary citizen lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not there for a career,'' Miller said. ``They're there
to serve their constituents, ideally for no more than six years,
and then head back to the district. They're not there to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the term-limit advocates won one key victory this fall.
As the new House leadership organized itself last month, it
resisted calls for removing the six-year term limit voted in 1994
for chairmanships of House committees. The next test may be whether
the new House keeps in place a stiff ban on gifts that took effect
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And some members who say they may extend their own stay are
renewing their backing for passing term limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to keep this issue to the forefront,'' said
Fowler, who helped lead the ill-fated attempt to pass a
constitutional amendment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to move it forward again,'' she said, adding that it
might have more success if the lawmakers could unite behind a less
stringent term limit of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Watts, he plans to continue voting for term limitations
if the measure comes before the House. But his spokeswoman Tobi
Edwards said, ``If the people in the 4th District decided they
wanted him to run again, he would consider it.''

HIRING WELFARE RECIPIENTS CAN BENEFIT SMALL FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Beti (NOTE: CQ) Ward, owner of a growing air cargo
company, was looking for a motivated worker to do the kind of
entry-level tasks every business has: filing, typing and basic
computer work.
</P>
<P>
   Darkina Burris, (NOTE: both CQ) single mother of two, was
looking for the kind of job that would give her her own desk, her
own computer and, more importantly, a way out of her old
neighborhood and the welfare trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't interviewed before, so I was nervous. And she was
tough,'' Burris recalls of Chief Executive Officer Ward. But since
she was hired at Phoenix-based American International Cargo in
1996, Burris has been promoted twice _ from file clerk then to
billing supervisor now _ and is one of the shining examples of how
small businesses can take a chance and win with people once deemed
unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for workers to fill jobs as companies boom and
Arizona's unemployment rate falls to a record low, small businesses
like Ward's are turning to a riskier pool of hires _ welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the idea makes sense: Small businesses need workers;
welfare recipients are an available supply. Since 1996 welfare
reform laws took effect, federal officials have been pushing large
and small businesses to get people off the rolls and into
hard-to-fill entry-level jobs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`In a shortage'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot more requests than ever before, because
everybody is in a shortage,'' said Andrea West, executive director
of Northside Training Center in Phoenix. The non-profit center
trains and counsels about 500 people a year in hopes of matching
them with jobs at 80 mostly small companies.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, the idea is no wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Economic Security didn't track how
many of its 11,000 welfare-to-work participants were placed in
small companies last year. But Bill Hernandez, director of the
Division of Employment and Rehabilitation Services, says the agency
deals with a cross section of employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our experience that small businesses are trying it
out, but they're not a key player,'' said Janette Torres, economic
development program manager for the city of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people require a great deal more than the average worker
in terms of benefits. Mentoring is important, and small businesses
don't have the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition from bigger businesses is another reason for the
spotty record. About 200 welfare recipients in three years have
gone through a training program started by DES and the Arizona
Restaurant Association, Executive Director Joe Yuhas said. However,
``our success led to other industries jumping on board, so now
we're competing with the others for a shrinking labor pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in the pool are typically women with two children,
little or no work experience, and an average of 18 months on
welfare, Hernandez said. Contrary to stereotypes, West said, many
turned to welfare after falling on bad times, such as having a
spouse leave or being hurt on the job. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advantages &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burris estimates she was on welfare six to 12 months, during
which time she went through a DES program that trains recipients in
basic skills like interviewing and filling out applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, frustrated with trying to attract job applicants to her
company's site near Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix,
had listed her jobs with DES' Job Service. The agency referred
Burris to the company, and it was up to her to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and others say hiring from the welfare rolls has several
advantages for small businesses:
</P>
<P>
   - They can hire at entry level, mold that person to their needs
and promote from within.
</P>
<P>
   ATC/Vancom of Arizona, which provides bus service at Sky Harbor
and for Phoenix Transit, has hired about 20 percent of its
workforce through Northside Training Center and other programs,
said Wil (NOTE: cq) Jackson, assistant general manager of
operations. It seeks people with positive attitudes and common
sense who are willing to learn the new skill of driving a bus, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward believes promoting from within gives her company people who
know what they're doing and who are more faithful to the firm.
Studies confirm that once welfare recipients are employed, they
tend to stay longer, Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   In Burris' case, Ward said, ``She was motivated enough to pick
things up going on around her, learn from them and assume more
responsibility. When we saw that, we started training her in other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   - New workers are surrounded by good examples, including owners
who know firsthand what it's like to build something from nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, as a female business owner, has become a positive role
model for Burris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get away from the negative energy and be surrounded
with positive energy,'' Burris said. ``When I went to American
International Cargo, I was surrounded with positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   - Smaller companies, often touted for their family atmosphere,
may be less intimidating than big companies filled with hundreds of
new faces and books full of rules.
</P>
<P>
   American International Cargo has 10 employees in its Phoenix
office and another 150 at its Los Angeles and Hawaii locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a huge company with 10 managers, they're busy,
busy,'' Burris said. ``Here, we can work around the corner and I
could get the attention I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   - Small companies may be more flexible regarding workers'
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who had raised three children herself while working in
real estate and as a beautician, knew what it's like to be short of
babysitting money and arrange one's workday around a sick child.
When that happened to Burris, Ward made sure the company let her
catch up by working different hours or different days.
</P>
<P>
   - Tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Though the need for dependable workers is a bigger driving
force, tax credits are available for hiring welfare recipients. The
federal government gives credits for 35 percent of the first
$10,000 of first-year wages, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 of
second-year wages. Employees must have been on welfare at least 18
months and must have been hired after Jan. 1, 1998, and before May
1, 1999. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Drawbacks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of these hires are countered by a number of
disadvantages, employers and officials say. These include:
</P>
<P>
   - Uneducated or unmotivated job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Many welfare recipients have little or no work experience, or no
recent work experience, DES' Hernandez said. Other would-be workers
have below-average reading, writing or math skills that programs
like Northside's try to improve.
</P>
<P>
   - The time it takes to train these workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ward thinks training is manageable when a business hires for
entry-level positions, in which the person will be doing tasks such
as filing documents in numeric or alphabetic order.
</P>
<P>
   For more specific skills, DES contracts with community colleges
and non-profit organizations to run training programs, including
ones for restaurants, electronics assemblers and call centers.
</P>
<P>
   - The level of pay and benefits needed to keep people off
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses can't afford to pay for health care
coverage or subsidize child care, said Marie Sullivan, executive
director of Arizona Women's Education and Employment. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Give them a chance' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Job applicants have told Ward that by the time they paid for child
care, they would be losing money by going to work. She replies that
unlike staying home, a job gives them a chance for advancement and
a chance to better themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and other experts agree that solving transportation and
child care problems would be a big help in the effort to link
welfare recipients to small-business jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Phoenix area's buses run at poor times, Burris is
saving to buy her own car. Until then, she often must depend on her
roommate to drive her the five miles to work.
</P>
<P>
   And though DES helped pay for child care as Burris made the
transition to work, Ward notes that the subsidies drop as workers
earn more, penalizing people who try to advance.
</P>
<P>
   An open mind, mentoring and communication also are vital to
making the welfare hire a successful one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these people without any bias or preconceived ideas,
and give them a chance,'' ATC/Vancom's Jackson said. ``Sometimes it
just takes a hand, and once they get their footing they are as good
as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward says she encouraged Burris to ask, rather than keep quiet,
when she didn't understand something. E-mail was an easy,
non-threatening tool.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship has turned into a personally satisfying one,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anyone to believe in me, and she did,'' Burris
said of Ward. ``I don't doubt myself now. I will (begin ital) never
(end ital) let my confidence go to the bottom of my feet again.'' &QL;

 (ATTN: Ky., Okla., Minn., N.J., Texas, N.Y., Mont., Wash., Fla.,
Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late at night, along Main Street in Louisville, the Kentucky
Center for the Arts sits in desolate silence across from the office
building of a major financial supporter, the Humana Foundation.
Restaurants are barely visible in the corners of office towers on
deserted streets. A few pedestrians turn up, walking with
purposeful strides. Cars pull into lots beneath the center.
</P>
<P>
   One evening not long ago, the scene inside was almost as
surreal. In a packed theater, a three-hour tribute to the mandolin
was in progress, featuring a folk musician playing bluegrass
mandolin, a Russian virtuoso known as ``the Paganini of the Dorma''
and a stage full of mandolinists modeling themselves on ensembles
that thrived in the Midwest 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of high, low and in between, of classical, jazz,
country and bluegrass, set in the middle of a darkened, urban
street of empty towers, seemed strange to a visitor used to the
more frenetic exteriors and less eclectic interiors of New York,
but the odd mix is not unusual in American arts centers. These
multipurpose, multicultural, multihalled institutions now dominate
the cultural scene, often in ways that have barely been recognized.
They are becoming as common as city halls, cost anywhere from $30
million to $200 million, and promise cultural rebirth and economic
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The development of these centers may mark the most dramatic
change in the American performing arts landscape since concert
halls were built in the 19th century. And just as concert halls
transformed the nature of classical music, arts centers are having
a profound, unexpected and largely unexamined impact on the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The centers, which range from converted movie theaters to
Lincoln Center-style complexes, were originally meant to provide
homes for classical performing arts groups like orchestras and
ballet companies. But they have become something else entirely. The
buildings don't just house culture; they alter it.
</P>
<P>
   They have, in their shape and design, actually created an ``arts
center culture.'' And the newest centers _ like the New Jersey
Performing Arts Center in Newark, or the Bass Performance Hall in
Fort Worth _ already take it for granted. Arts-center style leans
toward the classical performing arts but celebrates populist
variety; it boasts an elite character but celebrates a democratic
view of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hall in Texas, for example, was built with $65 million from
private and foundation sources, with orchestra, ballet and musical
theater in mind. But its current inaugural season also offers
Milton Berle, Judy Collins, the Flying Karamazov Brothers and the
ballet ``Romeo and Juliet'' danced on ice.
</P>
<P>
   And all across the country, high-grossing and popular Broadway
road shows are often displacing classical groups from their center
homes, sometimes for months.
</P>
<P>
   Why have classical arts tended to become less important in
institutions supposedly designed for their nurture, and why has a
more eclectic arts-center style emerged? Several reasons became
evident during visits to a number of arts centers, including three
vastly different types in Tulsa, Okla., Minneapolis and Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urban goals of the arts center _ to rebuild downtown
areas, increase foot traffic and invite large attendance _ often
conflict with the nonprofit artistic goals that the arts center is
supposed to embrace. If an artistic event does not attract
sufficient popular attention, it becomes a burden to the center
rather than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because many centers were also designed as grand civic
statements meant to transform declining downtowns, their main halls
are often too large for their communities, guaranteeing swaths of
empty seats for the more demanding arts _ a vacuum that many
centers have come to abhor.
</P>
<P>
   _ The high overhead of their new homes and increased competition
from the arts centers' own programming add to the classical groups'
woes, aggravating their already growing sense of marginality in
American culture.
</P>
<P>
   _ In an unexpected way, the arts center directors, with the
mandate to reach far beyond the classical performing arts for
programming, have become the dominant cultural impresarios in many
locales, supplanting the artistic directors of orchestras, ballet
companies and opera houses. The inevitable result: eclectic strains
in American performing arts are strengthened, while classical
strains are weakened. Arts that turn a profit compete successfully
with those that rely on patronage.
</P>
<P>
   The arts center's creation hinged on one set of premises; its
success hinges on another. In 1966, when New York's Lincoln Center
was still incomplete, its first president, the composer William
Schuman, predicted that its model of a ``cultural center'' would
become ``the new establishment.'' It has, but not in a way that
Schuman could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the arts center developed in the decade beginning
in the mid-1950s: classical arts were secure in their prestigious
positions in cultural life, and the National Endowment for the Arts
was conceived. At the same time, attention was ever more focused on
the racial and cultural problems of American cities. Lincoln Center
_ still the archetype _ combined these concerns, beginning with an
idea from Robert Moses' Committee on Slum Clearance in 1955 to
redevelop Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   As the concept spread to other cities, it brought the hope of
civic rebirth to abandoned downtowns. More than two-thirds of this
country's performing spaces have been built since Lincoln Center
was begun, with many of these thousands of buildings being called
not concert halls or theaters but arts centers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Typically, but not always, arts centers are products of
financial patchwork quilts. A state or city donates or leases the
land to a nonprofit organization. Private and foundation money is
used for construction, sometimes with public matching funds.
Classical arts groups are given priority access, sometimes renting
at a discount and contributing to the center's overhead. Other
rentals are solicited. And the center often puts together its own
presentations as well.
</P>
<P>
   Complexes range from the gargantuan Wortham Center in Houston to
more humble examples like the Myrna Loy Center in Helena, Mont.,
housed in a renovated former county jail. Some are mainly concert
halls, like the $118 million Benaroya Hall that opened in Seattle
this fall. Others, like the $187 million New Jersey Performing Arts
Center, are multihalled variations on the Lincoln Center model.
Some centers rent out their spaces for body-building competitions
and wedding receptions; others have more refined standards. Some
compete against other auditoriums; others don't.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis on urban renewal is fairly consistent. The
buildings do not evolve from their surroundings but are seemingly
inserted into them. This can create an eerie quality (one that even
Lincoln Center had in its earlier years), in which arts centers
seem  &UR; in &LR;  a place, but not  &UR; of &LR;  it, often rising out of dark,
deserted streets and reachable mainly by car. A new urban logic is
created: the arts don't grow out of the city; the city will grow
out of the arts _ or rather, out of the upper-income demographics
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   This urban ambition is one reason so many arts centers _
including Lincoln Center _ are overbuilt, as if preparing for the
hoped-for multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   But size can create problems. An opera house with 2,500 seats
must often satisfy a symphony orchestra that attracts an audience
of less than two-thirds that number (as is the case in Tulsa); the
ballet may fill even fewer seats (as has sometimes been the case in
Louisville).
</P>
<P>
   Size also affects content. Stars are hired to fill halls; pop
presentations are courted for their drawing power. And great chunks
of repertory are slighted. Lincoln Center's offerings, for example,
are hampered by the lack of a chamber opera theater; its
organizations must also scale their productions to fill large
spaces. Chamber music and vocal recitals may have a harder time on
the national circuit partly because they are unsuitable for many
centers. Some arts complexes offer small halls, but even then,
operas, ballets and orchestral concerts tend to be placed in arenas
too large for their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the arts-center model are not just physical;
an unexpected tension has arisen between centers and the classical
groups that inspired their construction. The groups need and want a
supportive home; the centers, though, aspire to more events, more
money, more artistic possibilities. And while a center can help
arts groups by easing promotional costs, interests often conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This competition has been most fierce outside the largest
cities, a situation aggravated by _ and aggravating _ the
increasing marginalization of the classical arts. In the 1950s and
early '60s, the Louisville Orchestra (which had an important
national presence with its recordings of new music) had no home;
neither did the local opera or ballet. They leased a local
legitimate theater, but the landlord planned to replace it with a
parking garage. The conflict ended up in court; finally, after 17
years of wrangling, negotiation and fund raising, the Kentucky
Center for the Arts opened in 1983 to provide a lasting home.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Louisville Orchestra, which has been
struggling, has had to seek other performance spaces when the
center wanted to make room for touring Broadway shows. The Kentucky
Opera, experiencing a drop in subscriptions, cut back its seasonal
offerings from five to three. There has been contentiousness over
how much responsibility lies with the companies and how much with
the center. The orchestra is about to announce that next season it
will move its classical series from the main arts-center building
to an off-site 1,400-seat theater managed by the center.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Van Kleeck, a classically trained musician who is
programming director of the Kentucky Center for the Arts, said in a
recent interview, ``Classical music continues to be the toughest
sell; it's tough to get audiences to come out.'' But the center, he
said, has recently examined its mission and will ``continue to keep
a schedule'' of classical events _ though they have become more
marginal than the center's founders originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the immense success of touring Broadway shows has
caused serious conflicts in cities with limited performing spaces,
forcing many opera companies and orchestras to relocate
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, in Louisville, the Disney musical ``Beauty and
the Beast'' will take over the main theater of the Kentucky Center
for the Arts for a month, forcing the Louisville Orchestra to play
at a renovated movie theater. And last season, the Florida
Orchestra could obtain only 3 of its desired 21 dates in the Tampa
Bay Performing Arts Center because of touring shows.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Judith Lisi, the president of the Tampa center,
acknowledged that the potential conflicts might even force
classical groups to reconsider their place in the very halls that
had been built for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' Ms. Lisi said, ``the orchestras may have to
deal with the problem and may have to build dedicated halls.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of the steady diets of classical fare originally
anticipated at many centers, what is being offered there now? Here
politics can be as influential as taste. At the Kentucky Center,
the board is appointed by the state's governor; in Tulsa, the
facility is overseen by the city government; in Hartford, the
Bushnell Theater is completely private and nonprofit. But
municipalities always stand in judgment, and these pressures _
unlike those from private donors _ tend to push in a populist
direction.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This has helped create the arts-center style. The emphasis is on
serving disparate communities, which in some cases leads to diverse
excellence and in others to pandering variety. Performances for
children are plentiful. So are performances that try to create
links with local ethnic and racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, country fiddling and jazz have found their way
into subscription series. In Los Angeles, the opera company has
appealed to Hispanic communities with zarzuelas. The California
Center of the Arts in Escondido also courts multiple audiences,
scheduling, during the next two months, ``The Hanukkah Story''
narrated by Leonard Nimoy, a mariachi band, ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' Argentine tangos and the
violinist Itzhak Perlman.
</P>
<P>
   The particular balance partly depends on the vision of the arts
center director, who, in city after city, has emerged as a dominant
cultural force. Ms. Lisi, for example, may be the most important
performing arts presenter in South Florida, booking about 100
different performances a year and running an education program for
about 100,000 schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, Van Kleeck's programming may be creating a
stronger profile than that of the classical arts groups. Last
season, the local premiere of ``Les Enfants Terribles'' by Philip
Glass attracted just a few hundred people, but Van Kleeck believes
the performance was important to his artistic mission.
</P>
<P>
   More commercially successful is Van Kleeck's regular
subscription series, ``Lonesome Pine,'' which last season included
the mandolin celebration and this winter offers the bluegrass of
John Cowan, the African rock vocals of Salif Keita, the Celtic
music of Anam and a Hawaiian slack-key guitar festival.
</P>
<P>
   The eclecticism can take on different characteristics in
different cities. During an intermission in Verdi's ``Aida'' at the
Tulsa Performing Arts Center last season, a 13-foot boa constrictor
was wrapped around the neck of an ``Egyptian.'' It was held out to
daring donors who were offered Polaroid photo-ops. In Tulsa, which
was celebrating its centennial origins as an American Indian
settlement and is also proud of its close connections to the
Midwestern wilderness, the snake seemed a reminder of how arts
centers adapt to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's character _ its conservative taste and entrepreneurial
spirit _ is evident even in the nature of the arts organizations
that perform at the center. The Tulsa Ballet owns rehearsal studios
in an outdoor strip mall, where store rents are used to support it.
Theater Tulsa lost many of is resources during the 1980s oil
depression, but continues as a thriving amateur group at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is far different in Minneapolis, which is a more
cosmopolitan university city; the Walker Art Center can even
specialize in a playful, often political avant-gardism that would
never last in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Once last season, the Sun Ra Arkestra entered the auditorium of
the Walker, clapping, chanting and wearing glittering outfits and
headgear _ a style set by the jazz orchestra's late founder, Sun
Ra, who liked to claim he was a visitor from outer space. But when
the group started to play ``When You Wish Upon a Star,'' spicing
the familiar tune with shrieking riffs and dissonant
improvisations, the audience _ at least half children _ looked as
if it had been abandoned by Jiminy Cricket. Undeterred adults
filled the hall for more serious intergalactic jazz that evening.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an atypical event for the Walker, a museum spiced
with performances. Its self-consciously post-modern presentations
of conceptual art, performance art and film easily find audiences
in a cultivated city that has the classical bases well covered.
(The Brooklyn Academy of Music under Harvey Lichtenstein has
defined a similar vision in New York City.) The Walker's director
of musical performance, Philip Bither, puts the museum's spirit of
rambunctious and contentious play in audible form, including, this
season, a cross-cultural band of Afro-Hispanic pop (Radio Tarifa),
an afternoon of interactive electronic music making (``Sonic
Circuits''), and ``A Prelude to Faust,'' in which the stories of
Faust and Job are intertwined and performed by a local puppeteer
and performance artist, Michael Sommers, and his troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its variations, the overall arts-center style is still
unmistakable, tapping into contemporary America's preoccupation
with democratization of the arts and taste: a refusal to make many
distinctions, a preference for events that provide the greatest
pleasure to the greatest number, a distrust of all elite claims.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest portrait of arts-center style was actually
suggested by an exhibition at the Walker last year, a show now at
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York: ``The
Architecture of Reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   This exhibit, about the design of Disney theme parks, shows maps
of various Tomorrowlands and Frontierlands, their grand vistas and
exotic possibilities extending outward from a quaint Main Street in
a stylized American town. That town hardly exists today (if it ever
did), but its remnants can be seen in the surreal street signs like
Market Street in bare, downtown Louisville, or in the suspended
corridors called skyways in downtown Minneapolis, which bridge
office buildings for the convenience of pedestrians in winter.
</P>
<P>
   At the artificial heart of these post-urban Main Streets, the
arts center is creating its own architecture of reassurance, a kind
of eclectic Disneyesque dream image rising out of the cityscape.
The towering office buildings and abandoned streets of many a
downtown lead to a cultural temple filled with fantastical
offerings. The bustle of the streets may be gone, but remnants of
the streets _ snakes and mandolins and mariachi bands _ find a home
even if classical arts languish. That home is a comfortable
well-lighted mall, with a series of amusements high and low, rides
for the daring, icons for the devoted, entertainment for the bored
and, on occasion perhaps, a kind of enlightenment.

 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a shirtsleeve day, and Dr. Joyce F. Brown, the
newly appointed president of the Fashion Institute of Technology,
has just finished meeting with a finance committee. Her desk is
cluttered with papers and she wonders if she should have her
picture taken behind such a jumble.
</P>
<P>
   As the new head of FIT _ not to mention the first black and
first woman to hold that $140,000-a-year position _ Dr. Brown is
understandably concerned with her image, but not overly concerned.
She is asked if she feels added pressure to perform well because
she is the first black to run the college. ``Being black is never
incidental,'' she said. ``It's central to who I am. But I don't
think FIT set out to make a statement about gender or ethnicity.
They wanted to find the best person to lead the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brown is also the wife of New York's second most powerful
state official, Comptroller H. Carl McCall. And while for some that
may have raised eyebrows, many say that Dr. Brown was the person
best suited for the job.
</P>
<P>
   While no one questions her qualifications, there has been
speculation in political, fashion and academic circles that the
appointment was approved by the State University Board of Trustees
in part because Gov. George Pataki, who controls the board, wanted
to dissuade her husband, the state's highest-ranking Democrat, from
campaigning vigorously in last month's election and drawing a
strong black turnout that could help Democratic candidates. Dr.
Brown herself repeats another theory making the rounds: that Pataki
did not want McCall running against him for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is when you're in public life people
say all kinds of things,'' said Dr. Brown, who, at 52, looks a
decade younger than her age. ``They try to denigrate our abilities
and contributions. I told Carl the other day they might as well
say, `Brown's husband for state comptroller' if they're going to
say `McCall's wife for FIT president.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop people from adding two plus two and getting six.
We can't stop them from saying, `The fix was in all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The journey to president of FIT was a long one that started with
a working class childhood in Harlem. Along the way she held a
number of senior administrative positions in public higher
education. She also served as deputy mayor for public and community
affairs under Mayor David Dinkins, who remembers her fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's terrific,'' he said. ``FIT is lucky to get her. She's
bright, tenacious and works awfully hard. In my administration
everyone had a voice. Joyce was somebody whose opinion I
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brown, who took the helm at FIT in early June, was most
recently professor of clinical psychology at the Graduate School
and University Center of the City University of New York. From 1990
to 1992, she held a number of posts at the City University,
including vice chancellor for student affairs and urban programs
and for urban affairs and development. In 1990, she was acting
president of Bernard Baruch College.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she has only recently taken the FIT post, she has
big plans. The four-year college, which bills itself as a school of
art and design, business and technology, is starting a capital
campaign, which among other things would add 300,000 square feet to
the campus, which is headquartered at 27th Street and Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have the industry have a real presence,'' Dr.
Brown said. ``We would love to have a facility that would allow
greater interaction with the industry, a place for real fashion
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal is to make people aware that FIT is a public
institution. Many people mistake it for a private school. ``I think
that people don't typically think of SUNY as being in New York
City,'' Dr. Brown said. ``But it's important for people to know
that we're part of SUNY because as such we provide opportunities
for kids who don't have opportunities to go to private schools and
to do the things that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brown and McCall (when he isn't in Albany) live in an Upper
West Side co-op, but hope to sell it soon; one of the perks of her
job is a campus apartment on 27th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Harlem, the youngest daughter of Robert Brown, a
postal clerk, and Joyce Brown, a clerk with the New York City
Housing Authority, Dr. Brown went to Roman Catholic schools. Her
older sister, Donna Levy Wray, is the director of an executive
program at Harvard's Kennedy School of government.
</P>
<P>
   How does Dr. Brown account for her success and that of her
sister? ``It was always a given that we would go to college and be
the best we could be in whatever we chose to do,'' she said.
``There was a strong work ethic and the belief that if we worked
hard and did not expect that it would be easy and we kept at it, it
would work.''

JUSTICES DRAW FINE DISTINCTIONS IN HOME-PRIVACY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People who are temporarily in someone else's home
to conduct business may not invoke the Constitution's protection
against unreasonable police searches, the Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday by a vote of 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a 1997 ruling of the Minnesota Supreme
Court, which set aside the narcotics convictions of two men who had
spent several hours in a third person's apartment preparing cocaine
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer, acting on a tip, observed the activity in the
basement apartment through a gap in the closed venetian blinds.
Although the officer later obtained a warrant to search the
apartment, the Minnesota court ruled that the initial observation
was an illegal search that the two men, as guests of the resident,
were entitled to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``society does not recognize as valuable the task of
bagging cocaine,'' the state court said, ``we conclude that society
does recognize as valuable the right of property owners or
leaseholders to invite persons into the privacy of their homes to
conduct a common task, be it legal or illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion Tuesday, Minnesota vs. Carter, No.
97-1147, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the men had no
``legitimate expectation of privacy'' in a home that was not theirs
and that was ``simply a place to do business.'' There was no need
to decide whether the officer's observation amounted to a search,
he said, because the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable
searches and seizures did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's precedents in this area have made a
``legitimate expectation of privacy'' the test for determining
whether someone is entitled to invoke the Fourth Amendment's
protections. In a 1990 case, Minnesota vs. Olson, the court ruled
that an overnight guest had such an expectation and thus could
claim Fourth Amendment rights. By contrast, a 1978 ruling, Rakas
vs. Illinois, held that automobile passengers were not entitled to
raise a Fourth Amendment objection to the seizure of incriminating
evidence if they owned neither the evidence nor the car, even if
they had a right to be in the car at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The case Tuesday, the chief justice said, fell ``obviously
somewhere in between'' those two relevant precedents, and it was
over its place along that spectrum on which the justices disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, in an opinion joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, said that in
this case, the ``purely commercial nature of the transaction,''
combined with the men's short stay and lack of previous connection
to the apartment's resident, made their situation ``closer to that
of one simply permitted on the premises,'' much like the passengers
in the 1978 decision.
</P>
<P>
   But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said
the case was much closer to the 1990 ruling about the overnight
guest. The majority opinion overlooked ``the unique importance of
the home _ the most essential bastion of privacy recognized by
law,'' she said, adding that the logic of shielding an overnight
guest's privacy ``extends to shorter-term guests as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the host's invitation, the guest gains a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the home,'' Ginsburg said, adding that
the guest ``should share his host's shelter against unreasonable
searches and seizures.'' Justices John Paul Stevens and David
Souter joined the dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer agreed with the
dissenters' constitutional analysis. But he said that even though
the men were entitled to the Fourth Amendment's protections, the
officer's observation through the window blinds did not amount to a
search, so the Fourth Amendment was not in fact violated in this
case. For that reason, Breyer joined the majority's judgment,
making the vote 6-3 to reinstate the men's convictions while making
the vote 5-4 on the underlying Fourth Amendment issue.
</P>
<P>
   There were interesting shades of difference even among the
majority. Scalia, in a concurring opinion that Thomas joined, said
the text of the Fourth Amendment itself, guaranteeing ``the right
of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects,'' made clear that the amendment's protection extended no
further than a person's own home. He noted that the amendment ``was
drawn from the English common-law maxim, `A man's home is his
castle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy took a contrary position in a concurring opinion of his
own, concluding that ``almost all social guests,'' even short-term
ones, have a legitimate expectation of privacy. But in this case
the men's connection with the home was too ``fleeting and
insubstantial'' to count, he said.

 LEDE &HT;    CLINTON AND DOLE BROKE SPENDING LIMITS, AUDITORS REPORT
 &HT;    Eds: Updates to insert 6th graf with comment from Common Cause
president.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 1996 presidential race, Democrat Bill
Clinton exceeded federal spending limits by more than $45 million
and Republican Bob Dole exceeded them by nearly $23 million,
according to federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Reports released Tuesday by the staff of the Federal Election
Commission note that in return for receiving federal money, each
candidate agreed in writing to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended that the FEC order Clinton to repay $7
million and Dole to repay nearly $17.9 million to the U.S.
Treasury. The auditors also asked the commission to require Dole to
repay $1.1 million in overcharges to news organizations and $65,000
to the Secret Service for travel with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns dispute the findings, which led to a Justice
Department probe of the Clinton campaign and may lead to a similar
probe of Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign lawyers described the audit findings as
``grossly inequitable.'' Dole's denounced them as an attempt at
``circumventing enforcement procedures'' by trying to distort the
audit requirement into ``a punitive process or to recapture private
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The full FEC will start trying to sort out the dispute Thursday.
It takes four votes for a decision from the commission, which
consists of three Republicans and three Democrats. That process,
and subsequent appeals to the commission and within the courts,
could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Ann McBride, president of Common Cause, a national civic group
that uncovered much of the activity the auditors described as
illegal, urged the commission to approve its staff's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we seen presidential candidates act in such
utter disregard of the law, `` McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the simultaneous release of the reports on questionable
activities by both Clinton and Dole makes it harder for Republicans
to portray the Democratic president as the only major violator of
the much-abused campaign finance laws during the 1996 campaign.
That could undermine efforts within the House Judiciary Committee
to add such violations to any bill of impeachment now under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said that in addition to uncovering an array of
minor discrepancies typical of past campaigns, they concluded that
Clinton exceeded the limits by $45 million in the primaries and
nothing in the general election, while Dole exceeded the limits by
nearly $23 million -- about $9 million in the primaries and $14
million in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors reported:
</P>
<P>
   Though each candidate agreed to spend only $31 million in
private contributions and matching federal funds in the primaries,
Clinton spent more than $76 million and Dole spent more than $40
million. The excess consisted mostly of polls and TV ads that
helped the candidates but were paid for by the Democratic and
Republican national committees.
</P>
<P>
   Each would have to repay only the federal portion of that
overspending. That would cost Clinton $7 million and Dole $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   After each agreed to spend only $62 million in federal funds on
his post-convention campaign, Clinton abided by the limit, but Dole
spent about $76 million. Dole would have to repay the entire $14
million in overspending, because general-election campaigns are
supposed to be financed 100 percent with federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The audits took more than 2 1/2 years to complete. Blaming
heel-dragging by the Clinton campaign, the auditors said they had
to resort to subpoenas more than 30 times to extract routine
records and other financial information from Clinton's
close-mouthed campaign aides and consultants.

ANTIQUES: FANTASY MACHINES FROM TECHNOLOGY'S DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mich.)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first glance, Steven Montgomery's fantasy machines
resemble the images that inspired them _ metal engines rusting in
Detroit junkyards and giant electrical conduits snaking along the
walls of tunnels and stairwells in the subways of Lower Manhattan.
Most of the machines are huge, up to 6 feet long, while others are
quite small, less than a foot tall.
</P>
<P>
   Close up, however, something seems amiss in these umber, dark
crimson and black assemblages: Here and there, they appear to be
broken or corroded. The simulated encrustation that should imply
decay on the pipes, gears, manifolds, mufflers and screws instead
raises questions about what the machines really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anyone would guess by just looking at them that
the machines are clay,'' Montgomery said. ``They don't look, feel
or smell like clay. That is partly because of the oil paint finish
that is not fired.''
</P>
<P>
   They fooled Soho art dealer Ivan Karp, who is familiar with the
trompe l'oeil effects artists use to trick viewers. ``I was drawn
to the machines for their sculptural vitality and wasn't aware of
the material that he was employing,'' Karp said. ``That for me and
for everybody was a grand surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of Montgomery's fictitious machines are on exhibit at Karp's
OK Harris gallery on West Broadway through Jan. 2. (They range in
price from $3,500 to $22,000.) The gallery does not specialize in
ceramics, but Karp, who was an airplane mechanic in the United
States Air Force during World War II, found Montgomery's works
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mention ceramics, and most people think of vessels or
something adorable or lovable or at least tender,'' Karp said.
</P>
<P>
   To him, Montgomery's objects are not adorable or tender; they
are aggressive. ``You have to be confounded by the fact that he
would translate them this way,'' Karp said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery has mixed feelings about machines. He is fascinated
by their form and power; for him, machines reflect the underbelly
of urban life and are the wellspring of his esthetic heritage.
``When you get off the No. 6 train at Canal Street and walk through
the tunnels to the J or M trains, you see a whole series of awesome
electrical pipes, elbows, connectors and cables along the walls and
lining the stairwells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has strong reservations about the efficiency and
durability of machines, even though he uses a potter's wheel and
kiln in his own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified of technology and machinery,'' Montgomery said.
``In 1979, an automobile I was driving caught fire on the freeway
and burned up on me. It was engulfed in flames in a minute and a
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery escaped unharmed, but never renewed his driver's
license and never drove again. Today he uses clay to do far more
than replicate metal. ``I'm commenting on my mistrust of
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A ceramist for 25 years, Montgomery was born in Detroit in 1954
and studied ceramics at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia
before coming to New York in 1980. He switched to working in metal,
did drawings of war machines and dirigibles, and in 1987 returned
to clay. He began making his ceramic machines in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To lessen his exposure to large kilns, Montgomery fashioned his
works out of a series of components. A year ago, he began to make
smaller works that he calls ``studies.'' He says he expects they
will evolve into larger works. ``The big ones are the ones that
engage me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is having a good year. In July, he was awarded a
grant from the Pollock-Krasner foundation for his work, and his
``Standard Emission,'' a small carburetor-like object, was acquired
by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Two weeks ago it went on view in
``Clay Into Art: Selections from the Contemporary Ceramics
Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' an exhibition of 61
works that remains through May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Adlin, who organized the show and is a research assistant
in the museum's department of 20th-century art, said she preferred
Montgomery's small works. ``They fool you,'' she said. ``When I saw
them for the first time, I thought maybe the carburetor-like work
was mixed media: the screw heads looked so real. Big is not always
better.''
</P>
<P>
   She compared Montgomery's work to that of some contemporary
Chinese ceramists in the way they, as she put it, ``capture
realism.'' ``But I think he stands out as distinctive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's work is also marked by a sense of humor,
incorporating what he calls ``jokes'' in his machines. He points to
a wrench on an enginelike object in the show. ``Look at what the
large wrench is doing on that work,'' he said. ``It's unscrewing
the valve that would let the motor oil gush forth.''

NO LONGER WELCOME, PINOCHET LEAVES LONDON HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Tuesday night left the
exclusive London hospital where he has spent the last month after
officials there expressed irritation at his continued presence and
threatened legal action to force him out.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance under police escort emerged from the hospital gates
and swept past hecklers, headed off on a nighttime journey to an
undisclosed location. Friends have reportedly been looking at a
house in an exclusive and secure neighborhood in Surrey south of
London where he can stay while his legal problems in London unfold.
</P>
<P>
   His departure put to an end a dispute between the former Chilean
dictator and hospital authorities who in recent days bluntly called
him an unwanted guest who had overstayed his welcome. In a
statement issued moments after he was gone, the hospital said,
``Grovelands Priory is grateful to the police and General
Pinochet's representatives for expediting his move after it
requested he find alternative accommodation following his period of
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the hospital had complained that the Chilean had been
given a clean bill of health from his Oct. 9 back surgery two weeks
ago and suggested he might be extending his medical stay to avoid
appearing at hearings on his possible extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement with the chilling tone of a landlord's notice,
the hospital had said it repeatedly had had to ``remind'' his
advisers of the need for the move.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet responded with his own statement Tuesday afternoon,
saying he was ``distressed'' at the ``wholly unfounded''
interpretation being put on his failure to vacate. Michael Caplan,
a lawyer for the general, said his client had planned on leaving
Monday, but that plans had fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is due in court Dec. 11 for a hearing on a Spanish
petition to have him stand trial in Madrid on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture in connection with the murders or
``disappearances'' of 3,179 people during the years after he seized
power in Chile in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition request is under study by Home Secretary Jack
Straw, the British law enforcement minister, who alone has the
power to interrupt the process and send Pinochet home. One of the
grounds available to him for taking such action is a finding that
the 83-year-old general is not physically or mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Straw was closeted with close aides in his downtown office
Tuesday on the first of what looks like many intense days of
studying the welter of evidence and arguments submitted to him
before a Monday night deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has remained officially aloof from the
sensitive diplomatic case, saying it is a matter for the courts.
Prime Minister Tony Blair said last week that neither he nor
Cabinet colleagues of Straw's anticipate even being consulted about
Straw's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the government also took a detached view of U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's comment Monday that Chile's
right and desire to deal with its own past deserved ``significant
respect.'' Blair's spokesman said: ``They are entitled to express
their views. We don't think there is anything improper about people
making their views known.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Pinochet was arrested in a downtown London clinic
Oct. 16, the case has been a lively issue of debate in Britain
between the opposition Conservatives, who generally condemn the
action and believe the general should be freed, and the Labor
members of Parliament, many of whom want to see him sent to Spain
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The first poll to be published on the question appeared in
Tuesday afternoon's Evening Standard and showed 51 percent of the
people questioned in favor of sending Pinochet to Spain, 32 percent
for freeing him and 17 percent undecided.

   World War II, The Miniseries
</P>
<P>
   Acting in the movie ``Apollo 13'' helped inspire Tom Hanks to
pursue his fascination with space travel by creating the 12-hour
HBO miniseries ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' which won an Emmy
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hanks and director Steven Spielberg, inspired by their
experiences making the World War II film ``Saving Private Ryan,''
in which Hanks starred, have signed on as co-executive producers of
another HBO mega-miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   The two will make ``Band of Brothers,'' based on the 1992 best
seller by Stephen Ambrose, also about a special group of American
soldiers in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, the historian, has written numerous books about the
war, including a two-volume biography of Dwight D. Eisenhower. The
book's full title is ``Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment,
101st Airborne From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest.'' Its
subject is an elite rifle company that parachuted into France on
D-Day and later captured Hitler's mountain retreat at
Berchtesgaden.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been decided whether Hanks will act in the drama,
which is scheduled to appear in late 2000 or early 2001. Chris
Albrecht, president of HBO original programming, said Hanks had
been working on the overall story outline and outlines for
individual episodes ``for a couple of months now, on his own, and
we're about to announce a deal with a co-writer in the next day or
so,'' adding that the script would closely follow the book.

   Hanks was not available for comment, but Jeff Bewkes, HBO's
chairman and chief executive, said Hanks had done an
``extraordinary, hands-on, high-integrity job as executive producer
for `From the Earth to the Moon,''' and wanted to have similar
involvement with this project, which would be co-produced by
Dreamworks (in which Spielberg is a partner) and the Playtone Co.
(in which Hanks is a partner). Will it also have a similar price
tag of about $68 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can safely say it will cost more than that,'' Bewkes said.

   NBC's Young Viewers
</P>
<P>
   The November sweep month is gone, leaving a trail of
disappointment, if not tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, NBC held off Fox and won the only competition most
of the networks care about: commanding the most young-adult
viewers. But NBC's ratings fell off by the most of any network from
last season.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, relying mostly on its regular viewers, had the most
viewers. But its audience was older than ever; CBS finished fourth
even among viewers between 25 and 54.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spent the last week of the sweep excited by the prospect of
knocking off NBC, and pulled out every stop to do it. But
predictions that Fox would tie NBC fell short: NBC finished with a
5.9 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds, with Fox scoring a 5.7. (In
that group each rating point represents 1.24 million viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   The main culprits? Dinosaurs. Never has $80 million bought so
little. A second run in the same month of ``The Lost World'' was so
lackluster it guaranteed NBC the victory.
</P>
<P>
   More disconcerting to Fox may have been what happened the next
night, one night after the sweep ended: Another movie, ``Jumanji,''
dominated Thanksgiving night, knocking off NBC's perennial holiday
film, ``Home Alone.'' Had Fox used that movie on Wednesday, it
probably would have tied NBC. But Fox had a deal with a sole
sponsor, Toys R Us, to run that movie on Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   Without its powerhouse Thursday lineup, NBC's weaknesses were
more exposed in the ratings for the week that ended Sunday. Fox
clobbered NBC in the ratings among young adults. ABC also beat NBC
in that category. ``The X-Files'' took over as the top-rated show
among young adults. CBS easily won among total viewers for the week
as well, with NBC plummeting to fourth. ``60 Minutes'' was the most
watched show of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC finished the sweep strong, thanks to the powerful end to
Jimmy Smits' character on ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' But the network still
has to contend with the coming end of its most reliable ratings
performer, ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has yet to announce an official new Monday lineup, but it is
likely that a new edition of ``20/20'' will fill the 9 p.m. hour,
as it did last winter, while the struggling Saturday-night drama
``Cupid'' looks the best bet for 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC is facing the most crucial schedule decisions. Will the
network change its Thursday night in light of how effectively Fox
counter-programmed last month with action-oriented video specials?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. One proposed NBC schedule circulating at competing
networks had NBC returning ``Frasier'' to Tuesday, sliding
``Friends'' to 9 p.m. Thursday and relocating ``Just Shoot Me'' at
8 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday NBC executives were working on a schedule that
would leave Thursday intact, but revamp Tuesday and Wednesday. NBC
wants to give ``Will and Grace,'' the show it most wants to turn
into a hit (because it owns it), the best possible shot at building
an audience. That will almost surely mean moving it off Monday
night, where it has been suffering declines almost every week.

   TNT, TBS Acquire 97 Movies
</P>
<P>
   Cementing its identification as the cable empire with the
biggest library of recent movies, the Turner cable channels TNT and
TBS announced the acquisition Tuesday of a huge trove of recent
films, including such titles as ``Men in Black,'' ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' ``Ransom'' and ``The Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The channels concluded deals with Columbia, Disney and Warner
Bros. studios that will bring in 97 movies.
</P>
<P>
   These are all films that will have previously been shown on
broadcast networks. ``Twister,'' for example, has been on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But they will join a long list of films that the channels have
acquired to show before they are broadcast on network TV. Most
recently the Turner channels acquired the first network runs of
such films as ``As Good as It Gets,'' ``L.A. Confidential,''
``Pleasantville,'' ``Rush Hour,'' ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' and ``Living Out Loud.''

   Bright Lights, Big City
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after smiling their way through three hours of
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Matt Lauer and Al Roker of NBC
are back on holiday-cheer duty Wednesday, this time in the evening
hours as hosts of the Rockefeller Center Christmas-tree-lighting
show.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric got a break this time. ``Katie said two hours a day
is enough with us,'' said Roker, the weatherman who appears on
NBC's ``Today'' show with Ms. Couric and Lauer. ``She's saddling
Jane Pauley with us for this show.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of being shown live only in New York, the
hourlong tree-lighting festivities will be televised live
nationally (8 p.m. Eastern time) this year, with an additional hour
just for New York-area viewers (Channel 4 at 7 p.m.). Performers
include the singers Garth Brooks, Cyndi Lauper and Baby Face; the
Radio City Rockettes, and Kristi Yamaguchi skating to ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying for 10 years this should be a national
show,'' Roker said Tuesday. WNBC station president Dennis Swanson
agreed. Last year, he sold the show in syndication and stations
around the country snapped it up. But what really influenced NBC
was the live show's ratings in New York: about three million
people, and a quarter of all homes watching television, tuned to
Channel 4 that hour.
</P>
<P>
   And all the jollity isn't wearing thin for Roker _ not this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on auto-grin right now, with the birth of my new daughter,
Leila Ruth,'' he said. The baby's mother, Deborah Roberts, is a
correspondent for ABC's ``20/20.'' Leila Ruth was 2 weeks old
Tuesday.

EXPANDED IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY COULD STRETCH INTO 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee voted Tuesday to
expand its impeachment inquiry into whether President Clinton
violated campaign finance laws _ a move that threatens to drag the
investigation into next year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 20-15 along party lines to subpoena evidence
from a Justice Department investigation of fund-raising in
Clinton's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., committee chairman, insisted that the
expansion of the investigation would not destroy his self-imposed
deadline of Dec. 31 for ending the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely committed myself to wrapping this up this
year,'' he said. The chairman also said: ``We're not going on a
wild goose chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee spokesman Paul McNulty conceded to reporters that
adding campaign finance to the committee's agenda could force it to
abandon the year-end deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tough _ if credible evidence of wrongdoing is
discovered _ to stick with our schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCullum, R-Fla., said he hoped the investigation into
possible campaign finance violations would not delay the committee
but that ``this committee cannot in all conscience turn away from
information that could ... bear directly on what this committee
must do.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is seeking internal memos from FBI Director Louis
Freeh and former Justice Department prosecutor Charles LaBella, who
headed a task force investigating campaign finance violations, that
reportedly urge Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The memos were introduced in evidence before a federal grand
jury investigating allegations that foreign contributors may have
tried to influence administration policy by donating large sums of
money. The panel also is investigating accusations that the
president and his aides orchestrated a massive fund-raising effort
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's Republican leadership moved to expand
the impeachment investigation and to subpoena the Freeh and LaBella
memos after U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson turned down
a committee request last week that she turn the documents over to
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty also said the committee wanted to expand the
investigation because a ``credible'' source had given it
``information which suggests that the campaign finance abuse memos
may contain allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the president.''
McNulty would not identify the source or indicate whether the
person worked for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ridiculed the committee's GOP majority for expanding
the investigation beyond Clinton's involvement in the coverup of
his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the committee has tentatively scheduled a debate and vote
on articles of impeachment for Dec. 10 through Dec. 12, senior
Democrat Rep. John Conyers of Michigan said: ``One week away from
such a monumental vote is not time to commence an entirely new area
of investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's my worry that this is becoming an impeachment
inquiry in search of a high crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., called the expansion the ``last gasp
of people who want to impeach Clinton but haven't been able to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican committee members defended the move.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the committee has ``the right
and obligation to follow leads wherever they take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the committee heard testimony from two women convicted
of perjury resulting from false testimony in sex-related civil
cases in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The committee presented the witnesses in an effort to draw a
parallel to Clinton's case. The president has been accused by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr of committing perjury in the
now-withdrawn civil lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, who claimed the
then-governor of Arkansas made a crude sexual overture to her when
she was a state employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a president is not a king, he or she must abide by the
same laws as the rest of us,'' said Barbara Battalino, a former
Veterans Affairs hospital psychologist from Los Osos, Calif., who
is serving a home detention sentence after pleading guilty in a
case in which she lied about a single instance of consensual oral
sex with a male patient in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if justice does not prevail, Mr. Clinton's consequences
will be reserved for God and history to determine.''
</P>
<P>
   The other witness, former University of South Carolina women's
basketball coach Pam Parsons of Atlanta, pleaded guilty to a
federal perjury charge in a civil case about a sexual relationship
she had with a player.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons told lawmakers she pled guilty in 1984 to lying under
oath when she said she had never been to a particular gay nightspot
in Salt Lake City. She served five years on probation from 1985 to
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have done what no one else has been able to do,'' said
Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C. ``You have thrown a wrench in the White
House spin machine.'' Inglis said the women had been able ``to stop
the attack on the attacker,'' a reference to White House efforts to
demonize Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the committee heard from a panel of active and
retired judges and military personnel on the consequences of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. 11th Circuit Court Judge Gerald Tjoflat compared perjury to
dropping a pebble in a pond, saying it produces a ``ripple effect
... that breeds disrespect for the rule of law throughout the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Adm. Leon A. Edney, former vice chief of naval
operations, said the country's military could not function if lying
were permitted. ```Do as I say, not as I do' doesn't hack it the
armed forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But retired Judge Leon Higginbotham Jr. said the committee
should take into consideration the fact that removing the president
for perjury could seriously ``disrupt'' the country.

U.S. LOOKING FOR NEW MILITARY BASES IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ The United States has begun talks with
several countries to find new bases of operation in Central and
South America for the American military forces that must soon leave
Panama, American officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, while preliminary, have taken on new urgency
because the United States has to close its principal airfield in
Panama by May 1 as part of its agreement to relinquish control of
the Panama Canal entirely by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The airfield, Howard Air Force Base, a few miles west of Panama
City, supports the bulk of the aircraft and other forces involved
in American-led efforts to stop the flow of cocaine and other drugs
flowing from South America to the United States. Without new bases
by that deadline, American commanders fear there could be an
interruption in the interdiction flights.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has held talks with Honduras, Peru and Ecuador
about the possibility of allowing small numbers of surveillance
aircraft, like AWAC's, to use existing airfields in those
countries, senior defense officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities inherent in America's
military presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said he had discussed the issue
with a number of countries gathered here for a three-day conference
of defense ministers from the Americas, but had not made a decision
or reached an agreement on the bases. ``What we are looking for are
forward operating locations that could be of assistance in
surveying the territory to prevent the transfer of narcotics,''
Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, commander of all American forces in
Central and South America, declined Tuesday to identify prospective
sites, but said in an interview, ``We need to be close to the
regions where we need to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Panama Canal opened in 1917, the United States
has kept a military presence in Panama, but that force has
gradually dwindled in accordance with the treaties President Carter
negotiated in 1977 to return control of the canal to the
Panamanians. The Pentagon had hoped to reach agreement with Panama
to maintain a presence and, for a time, considered a proposal by
the Panamanians to create a multinational counter-drug center at
Howard. But those negotiations faltered in September over the
Americans' insistence that the United States still be able mount
other military operations from the base, not just those involving
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now has about 4,000 troops in Panama, nearly
half of them at Howard Air Force Base, which has been the primary
center for the anti-drug operations since 1990. Although Howard has
only a dozen aircraft permanently based there, scores of fighters,
tankers and surveillance jets pass through, flying some 15,000
missions a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm said the United States was likely to need two or three
forward bases in the immediate future to even come close to
replicating the range of flights now launched from Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the United States did not need large
airfields, but rather support bases, with few troops, that would
allow aircraft from the United States to operate during short
missions to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in building air bases,'' Wilhelm said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the heads of most of the world's biggest oil companies were
invited recently to the home of the Saudi ambassador to the United
States, each of the seven tried valiantly to put his best foot
forward. They had come here, after all, to discuss a tantalizing
opportunity _ helping Saudi Arabia develop its vast energy
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Up first was Exxon chairman Lee Raymond, who delivered a trim,
concise speech. He recited, from memory, statistics on Saudi
natural gas reserves and suggested some specific ways Exxon might
be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   Five other executives followed him, each making low-key,
carefully worded pitches. Finally it was the turn of Mobil chairman
Lucio Noto, who, characteristically, started off with a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Little had changed, he said, since Mobil had been the smallest
partner in Aramco, the four-company partnership the Saudis
nationalized in the 1970s. Now, once again, he was the last in
line.
</P>
<P>
   That shattered the meeting's icy atmosphere, allowing Noto to go
into a lengthy discourse on the Saudi political landscape, ground
that he was familiar with because he had known some Saudi princes
when he had lived in the country as a young Mobil executive two
decades before.
</P>
<P>
   The bosses at Exxon and Mobil, in short, have markedly different
styles, making their proposed alliance seem an odd match indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would be a marriage of equals, though. It is Raymond
who would put a far bigger stamp on the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, 60, has always been clear and focused. He grew up in
tiny Watertown, S.D., and, in 1963, armed with a doctorate in
chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota, he joined
Exxon as a production research engineer. In his methodical rise at
Exxon, he never flinching from tough assignments, including
overseeing the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the legal
settlements that followed. He gained a reputation of being reserved
and analytical, of investing Exxon's huge cash flow with great
care. So it surprised no one when he was named chairman and chief
executive in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Noto is also 60 but has a far quirkier resume. The son of
Italian immigrants, he once pushed clothing-filled handcarts in New
York in the summer. Persistent and gregarious, he was able, soon
after he getting his M.B.A. at Cornell and starting his climb at
Mobil, to impress the powerful with a savvy sense of political and
economic trends. He was a dark horse when the top spot opened up in
1994, and even he was surprised when he was named chairman,
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, each man does reflect the company he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, which spends millions to run opinion-laden advertisements
and sponsor ``Masterpiece Theater,'' has long been aggressive in
courting public opinion. Run by strong executives who are given a
lot of leeway to take risks, the company found ways to make deals
to get into Russia and Kazakhstan. And it is quick to apply new
technology, leading the way, for instance, in credit card systems
that allow pay-at-the-pump gasoline sales. Before Noto got on the
scene, though, Mobil's return on equity was far from stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, by contrast, run under the tight grip of Raymond and a
small group of top executives, tries to avoid the limelight even
when the news is good. It excels at squeezing the most return from
the resources it has, but balks at taking political risks. And
while its exploration skills are first-rate and its refineries and
network of service stations are run with clockwork efficiency, it
likes to limit its risk. For example, it preferred to let Royal
Dutch/Shell show that oil and natural gas could be profitably
recovered from fields lying thousands of feet under the ocean floor
before it took the big plunge itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the merged company, with Raymond in charge, would be likely
to mirror the Exxon model, with the devotion to cost-cutting and
engineering prowess that has made Exxon by far the most profitable
of the oil majors. In an era of $11-a-barrel oil, energy diplomacy
and power politics _ Mobil's specialties _ may have to take a back
seat for now.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mobil, and its distinctive style, would be entirely
swallowed up. As in any marriage of opposites, analysts say, the
beginning may be rocky, but later each may find that its partner
has strengths that will shore up its own weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   But there could still be problems. ``They are both so
independent that they like to do things their way,'' said Fred
Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear, Stearns, said of Raymond and Noto.
``That makes it almost impossible to get together in any amicable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu Zajdela, a managing director of Petroleum Finance Co., a
consulting group based in Washington, who has worked with Mobil in
Europe over the years, foresees difficulties because Exxon is so
much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, analysts say, is that Raymond, so used to thinking
of Exxon as a paragon of efficiency and profitability, would ride
roughshod over Mobil. And the merger would, in fact, leave Noto
playing a very limited role, as vice chairman of a 19-member board
that included just 6 directors from Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond would take all the top positions _ chairman, chief
executive and president. And the headquarters of the new
Exxon-Mobil would be in Irving, Texas, the Dallas suburb that is
Exxon's home now, far from Mobil's home base in Fairfax, Va., which
will house the company's management for refining and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Noto would be surprised at his secondary role. The
plunging crude oil prices that have put pressure on the whole
industry have hit Mobil especially hard because it is smaller.
Earlier this year Noto began looking for a merger partner,
approaching British Petroleum, Amoco and Conoco. In August, though,
when British Petroleum announced its $48 billion takeover of Amoco,
his options narrowed considerably. And talks with Conoco were
called off when it became clear that it would not be a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   And Exxon was surely even tougher for Noto to crack because of
its size and because Raymond had always been wary of the
uncertainties of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Noto, however, is known for his persuasive powers. Two years ago
he put together a joint marketing and refining venture with British
Petroleum that has led to the shedding of thousands of jobs and the
saving of about $500 million a year in costs, a move that prompted
other oil majors to form similar ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a merger was born, Raymond said in an interview
yesterday afternoon, in lower-level talks earlier this year about
combining refining operations in Japan. When he and Noto attended a
meeting together in June, Raymond brought up those talks and said,
``Maybe we should talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Noto responded, ``That and other things.'' Within three
weeks, the two were talking about far closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, sitting next to Raymond, acknowledged that the two had
different styles, but said, ``You don't run a company based on
style.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was ``quite comfortable'' working for Raymond,
a rival he has butted heads with many a time. ``I can adapt myself
to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies, Noto stressed, have many things in common,
like not basing ``our strategy on what is popular today.''

</P>
<P>
   The two companies, Noto stressed, have many things in common,
like not basing ``our strategy on what is popular today.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he took charge at Mobil, Noto made it clear that even
though Mobil had already gone through the wringer, shedding 15,000
workers over the previous five years, it was just the beginning.
``The challenge is how do you run the company the way you think it
should be run and still have enough of an eye on the short-term
considerations, like the shareholders?'' he said in an interview
shortly before he took over.
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to make Mobil more profitable and make
shareholders happy, a goal analysts say he has achieved. He set out
to cut another 15,000 jobs and to pass down more power to middle
management to shake Mobil out of its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   But cutting jobs would not be enough for either company. Both
Noto and Raymond faced the daunting task of finding huge new fields
of oil and natural gas to replace dwindling reserves. Both pinned
high hopes on the opening of Russia and other former Soviet bloc
countries, with their vast reserves, but economic and political
realities soon derailed those dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That left even a strong company like Exxon, which has been slow
to replace reserves, wondering where it would strike oil next.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond may well fall behind Noto on diplomatic skills. He has
been in the forefront, for instance, in speaking out on global
warming, insisting that it has not been proved scientifically. As
chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade
group, he has been the point man in trying to head off attempts to
limit emissions of carbon dioxide, which would almost surely force
industries to cut down on oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And he has not been afraid to be blunt about it, causing an
uproar at a meeting of the World Petroleum Congress last year for
his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people seemed astonished that someone would actually
stand up in public and point out some of the scientific
uncertainties and damaging economic consequences of the proposals
under discussion,'' he said at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with the varied groups claiming damages from the
Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989, he has often taken a tough
line to keep claims down.
</P>
<P>
   He was also willing to take the heat for having Exxon go through
a continuing long and costly appeal of a $5 billion jury award in
the case, even though many people said Exxon should have simply
paid it.
</P>
<P>
   As for today's challenges, Noto and Raymond might be the ideal
team. Noto was in Saudi Arabia from 1977 to 1985, making friends
with some current Saudi leaders. And Raymond has the resources and
skills to put projects together. Between them they may find a way
back into the country with by far the largest oil reserves in the
world.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
When Jeff Kelly left La Grange High School to play football at
Stephen F. Austin, he intended to spend his entire college career
at middle linebacker for the Lumberjacks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I thought I would stay there for four years,'' Kelly said.
``But (SFA) coach (John) Pearce was really good to me. He told me I
had the talent to play at a bigger school if that's what I wanted
to do. He really helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches might not be willing to give up their best player,
but Pearce knew Kelly belonged on a bigger stage and wanted what
was best for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, he gave me the option of playing fullback or
linebacker,'' Kelly said. ``I started at linebacker as a true
freshman, then he helped me pick a junior college so I could move
on. He told me if it didn't work out, I always could come back to
Stephen F. Austin. But he thought I would end up elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearce was right. Kelly became a junior-college All-American at
Garden City (Kan.) before transferring to Kansas State. Now, he is
an All-American for a team that is undefeated and hoping for a shot
at the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads for St. Louis to play Texas A&AMP;M on Saturday in the
Big 12 Championship Game, Kelly realizes he's a long way from where
he could have been had he stayed in Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Pearce and my parents took me where I needed to go,''
Kelly said. ``Coming here was the best thing that ever happened to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, a former head coach at Willowridge, found out last week
that his contract at SFA would not be renewed, which Kelly was
disappointed to hear. Maybe Kansas State coach Bill Snyder needs to
send Pearce a thank-you note, because Kelly is the best player on
one of the best defensive units in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is sitting in the middle of the whole thing for us,''
Snyder said. ``He's a guy with a great knack for the football. He
loves to play the game, and he has fun practicing. He runs
extremely well, and he's a very physical player to go with it. He's
very athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-0 and 245 pounds, Kelly has the strength to take on
interior linemen and the speed to run down wide receivers. With
senior linebacker Travis Ochs and junior Marc Simoneau flanking
him, many consider the Kansas State trio the best linebacker group
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any defense, the linebackers are instrumental in your
success,'' Snyder said. ``All three of our starters have been an
integral part of the success we've had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate that the three of them have played a lot of
games together. They are the backbone of the defense. They have
gotten better in the last two years by playing together more and
more. They have a great understanding of our defense, and they know
each other well. They have learned how to complement each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The two linebackers who will be in the spotlight Saturday are
Kelly and Dat Nguyen of A&AMP;M, both of whom already have made
All-America teams this season. Kelly spent part of his Thanksgiving
weekend at Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium watching Nguyen and the
Aggies (10-2) lose to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dat runs to the ball everywhere it goes,'' Kelly said. ``He's
a great player, and I know people are going to compare us. But
we're just two guys trying to help our teams reach a major goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal for the Wildcats is to give Kansas State its
first Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough game,'' Kelly said. ``A&AMP;M lost a
close game, and they will come out there Saturday with something to
prove. Believe me, (the loss to Texas) will be a power boost for
them. They will come out ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger goal that might be out of reach for the Wildcats is
the national championship. Kansas State would be 12-0 with a
victory over the Aggies, but Tennessee and UCLA are in line to play
in the Fiesta Bowl unless one of those teams loses Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly insists he won't be disappointed if the Wildcats are left
out of the title game. Besides, since Kansas State is No. 1 in the
coaches poll, it's possible it could stay there if it remains
unbeaten with a win over Ohio State or Florida State in the Sugar
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Kelly said. ``If we win all our games, we
would accomplish what we set out to accomplish. We just have to do
what we can do, and God willing, we'll get there.''

SCHOOLCHILDREN SET OUT TO BUY FREEDOM FOR SLAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By MINDY SINK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AURORA, Colo. _ Josh did extra chores around the house to make
at least $11. Leshai collects dropped coins. Ben brings in 50 cents
or so from his $5 allowance.
</P>
<P>
   These fourth-grade students at Highline Community School in this
suburb of Denver are raising money to help free slaves in Sudan.
They have raised enough money through private donations and other
sources, about $35,000, to free 601 people from chattel slavery in
Sudan, at a current value of about $50 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The money is channeled through Christian Solidarity
International, a nonprofit human rights organization in Zurich,
Switzerland, and delivered through middlemen to buy the slaves back
and return them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our freedom, they should have their freedom,'' Nicole
Cimino said. Nicole, 9, was wearing baggy jeans and an oversized
sweatshirt with the words of Martin Luther King Jr. on the back:
``The greatest sin of our time is not the few who have destroyed
but the vast majority who have sat idly by.''
</P>
<P>
   The children began their unusual efforts in February when their
teacher, Barbara Vogel, read a newspaper article about slavery in
Sudan and Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished lessons on American history and
slavery,'' Mrs. Vogel said. ``I saw this article and wanted to
share it with the students. I have been teaching for 25 years and
saw the shuttle blow up with my students watching, and we have
talked about the Oklahoma City bombing, but I have never seen
children touched like this. I saw boys and girls crying, and they
said, `We thought slavery was over,' and I said, `So did I.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vogel, who sat in front of a wall decorated with handmade
paper dolls that represented each slave freed, fought back her own
tears as she said, ``They asked me, `What are we going to do about
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   What they did was create ``STOP: Slavery That Oppresses
People,'' an awareness campaign they have now incorporated into
many of their daily studies.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons revolve around the fund-raising campaign. Maps for
geography lessons carry sticky notes with frowning faces on the
countries that still practice slavery; letters to politicians and
celebrities are exercises in penmanship, grammar and spelling; and
the money they raise gets divided and multiplied in math lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Leshai Renfrow, 9, worked on her penmanship and spelling as she
wrote a letter to the Rev. Jesse Jackson about the project. ``Some
people would think it's not going on, it's way passed by, but it's
not,'' she said. ``Modern slavery is still going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vogel describes the student body as ``children without many
means,'' but she wanted to show them what a good citizen can do.
``Citizenship and humanitarianism should be taught along with
everything else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The class started by saving money in an old water-cooler bottle
_ found change, the proceeds of lemonade and toy sales, the rewards
of extra chores at their homes. They then started writing letters
in an effort to free one slave, and connected with Christian
Solidarity International.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative did not come from us, but from the innocence of
children who cannot believe that slavery should be allowed to take
place at the end of the 20th century,'' said John Eibner, assistant
to the president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said that slavery is one of the consequences of a civil war
between the Arab Muslims of northern Sudan and the mainly Christian
and animist blacks of southern Sudan. He estimates that tens of
thousands of people, mostly women and children, have been forced to
work as household slaves and field hands.

CHINESE AND U.S. COLLEGES ESTABLISH CLOSER TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Conn., Mass., N.Y., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few nations, if any, have had a more turbulent relationship with
the United States in this century than China. After the Boxer
Rebellion in 1900 when roving bands of Chinese slaughtered hundreds
of American missionaries, the two nations gradually pulled together
and became allies in World War II. But soon after, American and
Chinese troops were shooting at each other in Korea, which led to
some of the most intense days of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations resumed diplomatic relations in 1979, and
American educators returned to China, only to pack their bags and
depart a decade later, after the Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite tensions recently provoked by the Chinese
government's continuing crackdown on democracy advocates, the
relationship between venturesome American colleges and universities
and China is warming up _ some say sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Buffalo's MBA program based in Beijing that
was terminated after Tiananmen Square will be restarted in January.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, Temple University will inaugurate a two-year
Master's of Law for some 50 Chinese law graduates and judges in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale China Association, originally a missionary organization
founded in 1901, which now supports teachers and medical personnel
in China, is being deluged with requests from Chinese institutions
seeking partnerships with American schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Chapman, executive director of the Yale China Association,
which is an independent affiliate of Yale University, said many of
the requests she receives come about because her organization is
``a known quantity in China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing interest is mutual,'' she said. ``The deans of
most of the professional schools at Yale _ from the Music School to
the School of Public Health _ have visited China recently with the
aim of establishing academic ties. That's new.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, there are hundreds (not even the Chinese know exactly
how many) of academic programs in China resulting from
collaborations between Chinese and American colleges and
universities, and more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Peace Lenn, executive director of the Global Alliance
for Transnational Education, a nonprofit accrediting agency, said,
``It's a growth industry with dramatic numbers even taking into
consideration the recent economic downturn in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Vogel, director of Harvard University's Asia Center, an
academic research institution focused on China, confirmed this
view. ``There's great intellectual ferment and excitement in China
about opening what was for so long a closed society,'' he said.
Last spring, Vogel accompanied Neil Rudenstine, president of
Harvard, on two visits to China _ preliminaries for closer ties in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``China did more than $260 billion in foreign trade in each of
the last two years, and with that kind of contact the Chinese need
to train a whole generation that's been closed off from affairs
outside their country,'' Vogel said. ``China has made more than 100
contacts just with Harvard. They need everything _ information
about pollution control, health and medicine, an insurance system,
finance, how to get alumni to support a university. There's no end
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of overdependence on the West, Chinese officials in the
United States speak guardedly about the joint ventures. Dunhuang
Xu, chief of the education section of the Chinese Consulate in New
York, who spoke through an interpreter, insisted that China had its
own highly developed educational system and that all contacts with
American colleges and universities must be made in partnership with
Chinese schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Xu acknowledged: ``We need to train specialists.
Our graduates in these fields must know what to do both inside of
China and outside of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of this activity, the internationalization of China
is not without difficulties. ``When you first offer your faculty a
chance to teach in China, they jump,'' said Lewis Mandell, dean of
the University of Buffalo's School of Management. ``But after
they've been there once, and discovered that the air in Beijing is
pretty dirty and that January in Beijing is not like April in
Paris, they aren't so eager to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the obstacles, why the rush?
</P>
<P>
   The foremost reason for American interest in teaching in China
goes by the name of globalism. In a world that appears to be
shrinking with rapidity, almost no one in American higher education
wants to be thought of as provincial.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Trachtenberg, president of George Washington University,
sounded the trend in a speech last month: ``Internationalism has
moved from being an academic ideal to becoming, increasingly, an
academic reality.'' The world, he concluded, is in the process of
developing ``a planetary education system.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kirby, chairman of the department of history at Harvard
University and a specialist in modern Chinese history, said that
today American colleges and universities ``are under great pressure
from an increasingly diverse student body to broaden the
curriculum.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The University of Buffalo has other motives for setting up a
joint venture in Beijing, according to Mandell. ``We're only 30
percent supported by tax revenues today, and in five years we
project that will be down to 15 or 20 percent,'' he said. ``So we
have to run ourselves like a for-profit business. Our China program
can bring in a couple of hundred thousand a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is the hope that the program will add panache
to an institution's profile. After the University of Buffalo set up
its China program in the 1980s, Business Week ranked the school
among the top 40 business schools in the nation, but after the U.S.
State Department cut off funding following the Tiananmen Square
massacre and the program was terminated, the School of Management
declined in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aspire to be among the top 40 once again,'' Mandell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even the most high-minded pursuits in China pay off
with hard cash. Last year, Oberlin College received an anonymous
gift of $6 million in memory of the late H.H. Kung who had been
educated at the Oberlin branch in Shanxi province and gone on to
serve as Chiang Kai-shek's chief financier and premier of
Nationalist China.
</P>
<P>
   A similar gift was received by Yale University where Kung had
earned an M.A. in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, most experts agree, the old missionary zeal is still
alive in the United States, even if disguised in secular dress.
Among the best known of the college-affiliated survivors from the
China-missionary era are Princeton-in-Asia, the Yale China
Association and the Oberlin Shanxi Memorial Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we send teachers rather than missionaries to China
today, our mission statement written in 1911 hasn't changed,'' said
Carrie Gordon, executive director of Princeton-in-Asia, which is an
independent affiliate of Princeton University. ``We seek to promote
goodwill and understanding and to facilitate in every way the free
exchange of the best ideals in the civilizations of both the East
and the West.''

RUSSIANS PROPOSE ANOTHER SHUTTLE TRIP TO MIR AS SALVAGE OPERATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The Mir space station may not have logged
its final U.S. shuttle visit, and the Russians are exploring the
prospect of extending the aging outpost's orbital life beyond next
year with commercial funding, officials from the two countries said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came on the eve of the U.S. launch of the second
major component for a new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Endeavour was to blast off from NASA's Kennedy Space
Center on Thursday at 3:56 a.m.,EST. Forecasters predict a 60
percent chance that low clouds and rain showers either in Florida
or at one of the shuttle's emergency runways around the world could
force a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour carries a 25,000-pound component the shuttle crew will
link to the much larger Russian-built propulsion and power
generation module called ``Zarya'' that was successfully launched
from Central Asia on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a round of prelaunch meetings in Moscow for Zarya that
the Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev asked NASA Administrator
Dan Goldin to consider a 10th shuttle voyage to Mir to collect
laboratory research equipment that could be transferred to the new
station, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are compiling a list of equipment, their own,
European and U.S., that might be transferred, either on a combined
mission with the new station or for return to the ground and
relaunching, said Mike Hawes, NASA's chief station engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to admit we don't have a surplus of scientific
equipment. So any equipment that can be used for implementation of
the science program would be helpful, a benefit for both
countries,'' said Valeri Ryumin, the RSC-Energia aerospace company
official who serves as Russia's operations manager for the station.
``The issue will be rigorously assessed,'' he said through a
translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the discussions are going on at a fairly top
level,'' said Frank Culbertson, NASA's space station operations
manager. ``We'll make a recommendation based on our assessments of
risk versus gain.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shuttles flew a series of nine docking missions to Mir over
three years, culminating in what was to be the final mission last
June. However, the original agreement between the two countries for
the flights prior to the first flight called for up to 10 such
missions.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle/Mir missions included lengthy visits by seven U.S.
astronauts, which were considered a rehearsal of operations planned
for the new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   As the program came to its close, the Americans obtained an
agreement from the financially-troubled Russians to scuttle Mir in
the Pacific Ocean as soon as mid-1999 in order to ensure that it
would not compete with the new station for scarce funding.
</P>
<P>
   Though the agreement is still in place, another top Russian
space official said Tuesday that its technical experts believe Mir
could fly for another three years and may continue beyond next year
if an unidentified commercial source provides the funding.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect arises on the heels of a U.S. commitment to pay
the Russians $60 million to complete their massive service module,
the first habitable component of the new station. Russian financial
difficulties with the module forced a one-year delay in the start
of construction of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   The service module is undergoing extensive ground tests at its
Moscow-area production facility, and the July launch date listed by
the Russians is probably the earliest it could be launched, Hawes
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mikhail Sinelschikov, the chief of the Russian
Space Agency's human space program, Mir will be adequately funded
by his government through the middle of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But if it can secure funding from what he characterized as a
nongovernmental prospect, perhaps even a foreign one, Mir's
operations may be continued. Sinelschikov acknowledged the issue of
preserving the 13-year-old outpost has become a political one
within his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do have money, we will keep flying,'' said Sinelschikov,
also speaking through a translator. ``This is our choice. This is
our say. We are sovereign, an independent country. This is up to us
to decide''
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there is not enough funding to support two programs
at the same time; we would have to make a hard choice,'' said
Sinelschikov. ``We will make that choice. There is no doubt about
that. There is no alternative to our participation in the
international space station program.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mir is scuttled, the Russian's plans are to launch a final
crew in February. They would make preparations that would include
the arrival of the four Progress cargo capsules with the propellant
that would be required to lower the station's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmonauts would abandon the Mir while it was still at a
safe altitude. &QL;

SALE OF U.S. FIGHTER PLANES EASES TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has finally found a customer for
fighter planes that it sold to Pakistan but never delivered. The
incident created a longstanding irritation between the two
countries, senior American officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arriving to meet President
Clinton at the White House on Wednesday, New Zealand agreed Tuesday
to acquire the 28 F-16 fighters on a 10-year lease-buy arrangement
for about $105 million.
</P>
<P>
   American officials confirmed the arrangement but not the price
and said many details remain to be worked out, including how much
money will go directly to reimburse Pakistan and whether New
Zealand can later upgrade to a newer model.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had paid some $650 million for 28 of 60 F-16 fighters
it had ordered when a congressional amendment was triggered in 1990
that cut off all direct economic aid and military sales to
Pakistan. It was cut off when President George Bush said he could
no longer certify that Pakistan was not developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington refused to reimburse Pakistan, since the money
was already spent to build the planes, and it has been searching
intermittently for nearly a decade to find another customer, while
the planes remain in storage in the Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Clinton said that the situation was unfair and that he
would try to rectify it. But an effort in 1996 to sell nine of the
planes to Indonesia for $200 million was abandoned because of
congressional objections to Indonesia's human rights record. While
President Suharto has since resigned, Indonesia's economic collapse
made it an unlikely purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's nuclear program, which was almost entirely dependent
on Chinese expertise and aid, was undertaken in response to India's
nuclear program. In May, after India conducted nuclear tests,
Pakistan did as well, bringing down further economic sanctions
against both countries, which Pakistan could ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton formally waived some of those sanctions imposed
on India and Pakistan, allowing lending to resume by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the
Trade and Development Agency. American officials had said last
month that the sanctions would be waived as a reward to both
countries for agreeing to stop testing and as an incentive for
further steps to control proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The American and allied effort to defuse a nuclear arms race in
South Asia continues, and it will be a prime topic between Clinton
and Sharif, officials said. They will also discuss other concerns,
like drug trafficking and the situation in Afghanistan, where
Pakistan has been largely supportive of the Taliban movement that
has sheltered Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But progress on the F-16 issue will help ease the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's conservative government, led by Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley, considers the F-16s ``a windfall opportunity,'' she
said Tuesday in Wellington, the capital. ``The prices will not be
replicated in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's allies, including Washington, have been pressing
the country to modernize its military.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister's minority government immediately lost
the support of an independent member of Parliament, reducing her
majority to a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand deal, with payments spread out over 10 years,
will give the Pakistanis something back, but nothing like their
original outlay. The United States has hundreds of F-16s in Arizona
for which Washington is also seeking buyers.

   PEORIA-ARTS (Peoria, Ill.) _ When Richard Nixon asked, ``Will it
play in Peoria?'' he was taking the nation's temperature, checking
on the predilections of mainstream citizens. But he was also
reviving an adage from the early part of the century, when this was
a center of whisky production and an active vaudeville circuit
stop, and the farm folks were renowned as a particularly dour and
tough-to-please audience. When I echoed the question last month _
what I actually said was: ``So what plays in Peoria?'' _ the
occasion was a round-table discussion, organized at the request of
The New York Times, among representatives of local arts
organizations. The subject was the health of the arts here in this
conservative heartland city of 113,000 people on the Illinois
River. By Bruce Weber.

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GASSMAN-STEAM-FILM (Undated) _ For the Italian actor Alessandro
Gassman, taking the lead role in ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' was
the riskiest _ and maybe the smartest _ move of his career. Gassman
plays a married Italian designer who goes to Istanbul to take care
of his aunt's estate. While there, he discovers the enticing
culture of the Turkish bath _ and with it, the realization that he
is gay. His role in ``Steam,'' a thoughtful and elegiac film by
Ferzan Ozpetek, must have surprised some fans, since Gassman was
best known for a successful series of light comedies in recent
years. But his 76-year-old father was not shocked; in fact, he
encouraged the venture. After all, the father is Vittorio Gassman,
a fixture on the Italian stage and screen for more than 50 years.
By Ted Loos.

<P>
   TWILIGHT-ZONE-VIDEO (Undated) _ The television writer and
producer Rod Serling died 23 years ago, but watching him in action
today is as engrossing as taking in one of his fanciful dramas.
Maybe more so. ``There is a fifth dimension,'' he says at the start
of each episode of ``The Twilight Zone,'' the famed science fiction
series that ran from 1959 to 1965 and was his signature. As caught
in ``Treasures of the Twilight Zone,'' a new pair of digital video
disks from Panasonic Interactive Media, Serling is a man of both
artistic and pragmatic dispositions. By Peter M. Nichols.

   MARTHA-GRAHAM-SATIRE (New York) _ Despite forensic evidence, the
modern-dance pioneer Martha Graham did not die in 1991. She can be
found performing, name dropping and introducing guest
choreographers the first Wednesday and Thursday of most months at a
club in Manhattan's meatpacking district. Oh, she also grew 16
inches and is often mistaken for a soft-spoken, witty man named
Richard Move. Martha(AT)Mother is the event, a satiric character
study of Graham as artist, diva and publicity hound _ all portrayed
by the 6-foot-4-inch Move in Graham drag _ as well as a loving
tribute to modern dance and its practitioners. By William Harris.

   DUET-THEATER (New York) _ With the bravado of youth, the Adobe
Theater Company, a nonprofit troupe that prefers to spell its name

high-handedness and _ until their recent transfer to the 170-seat
Actors Playhouse in Greenwich Village _ high overhead. But after
their critically acclaimed ``Duet!: A Romantic Fable,'' a pulpy
parody of puppy love and American culture, closed with sold-out
houses in SoHo last year, this Off Off Broadway troupe took the
leap to their first open-ended commercial run and reopened the play
Off Broadway. By Steven Drukman.

   ORPHEUS-CHAMBER-ORCHESTRA (Hanoi, Vietnam) _ The twain met here
last month, when the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the conductorless
ensemble from New York, performed at the Hanoi Opera House.
Orpheus, which plays on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, was the
first professional American orchestra to appear in this country

   AMERICAN-ARTS-CENTER (Undated) _ American arts centers, those
multipurpose, multicultural, multihalled institutions now dominate
the cultural scene, often in ways that have barely been recognized.
They are becoming as common as city halls, cost anywhere from $30
million to $200 million, and promise cultural rebirth and economic
vitality. The development of these centers may mark the most
dramatic change in the American performing arts landscape since
concert halls were built in the 19th century. By Edward Rothstein.

   CHINA-AIDA (Shanghai) _ When enthusiastic applause erupted at
the final curtain for a recent production of Verdi's ``Aida,'' the
first opera to appear in Shanghai's sparklingly attractive new
opera house, Bonko Chan thought that he might collapse with a heart
attack. ``We only performed three nights, but that was enough for
me,'' said Chan, a freight-company executive who produced ``Aida''
in his spare time. ``I checked into a hospital with exhaustion.''
Bringing singers from Florence to pair them with dancers and
acrobats from Shanghai was a serious artistic and logistical
challenge in itself. But Chan had to add in the inevitable snafus
of a new performing-arts center, as well as countless political and
bureacratic land mines in a city where art is still dominated and
sometimes even strangled by officialdom. ``Aida'' was a critical
success, receiving well-deserved praise from Shanghai reviewers for
its captivating singing and lavish staging. By Seth Faison.

years, that is exactly what has happened. ``Jazz is a great

``Banned in New York'' is a live recording with one original tune
and a few standards, and aside from a little professional editing,
it was made for about $7. The music was captured on a small

gallery at Steve Wynn's new Bellagio Hotel was still open the other
night, at 11 o'clock, so I wandered in. Every day, I'm told, 1,800
people, which is the maximum number allowed, pay $10 to see what's
in the gallery's two small rooms (dark walls, spotlights on the
pictures). Half of them buy the $4 audio guides narrated by Wynn.
The crowds had thinned at night, which made it easier to see the
Brancusi and Giacometti sculptures and a big Franz Kline painting
called ``August Day.'' I mention those three works, among the
couple of dozen things on view, because the next morning, when I
returned to take another look, poof! They were gone. They'd been

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Nowhere would the new Exxon Mobil have a vaster
reach than in Asia, where the two companies own and operate
oilfields, refineries, pipelines and gas stations from the Arctic
chill of Sakhalin, off Siberia, to the tropical swelter of the
Natuna Islands of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday of Exxon Corp.'s $80 billion
acquisition of Mobil Corp. may have profound implications for the
Asian oil industry, which has been dominated by Royal Dutch/Shell
and Caltex Petroleum, a joint venture of Chevron and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Exxon Mobil would leapfrog Shell and equal Caltex as
the largest oil company in Asia, with roughly 8 percent of the 18.9
million barrels of oil products sold in the region in 1997. The new
company would dominate the refining capacity of Singapore, and be a
leading producer of natural gas and a pioneer in the emerging
market of China.
</P>
<P>
   `Caltex and Shell have pretty much been the one-two punch in
Asia over the past decade,'' said Al Troner, managing director of
Asia Pacific Energy Consulting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ``This
would create a very powerful new competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the deal's greatest impact would be felt in the Japanese
oil industry, which has suffered badly from overcapacity and
swooning prices. Although Exxon Mobil would be only the
second-largest oil company in Japan, after Nisseki Mitsubishi,
analysts said it would have enough marketing power to force Japan's
gasoline prices further down.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean disaster for smaller Japanese oil companies,
which cannot afford a price war at the pumps and have been left out
of the wave of consolidation in the oil industry. Nisseki
Mitsubishi itself is the result of a recent merger of two of
Japan's largest companies, Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pump prices will go down, and weaker oil companies will be
driven off the edge,'' said Lalita Gupta, an industry analyst with
Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. ``The big question is when is the
shake-out going to take place?''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil already operate a joint-venture company that
owns refineries and service stations in Japan. Ms. Gupta said the
venture had nearly twice the average monthly sales volume at its
service stations as Nisseki Mitsubishi. By merging outright, she
said, Exxon and Mobil could cut their overhead costs in Japan and
further reduce retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nisseki Mitsubishi wants to stabilize prices,'' she said.
``But Exxon and Mobil have a strategy of driving out competition by
reducing prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Asia, analysts said, Exxon and Mobil would
complement each other well, with few overlapping assets. Exxon is
the leading oil producer in Malaysia, while Mobil operates a huge
natural gas plant in the Indonesian province of Aceh. Mobil owns a
stake in a refinery in New Zealand, while Exxon is the largest
shareholder in a vast offshore gas field north of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The only duplication of assets is in Japan and Singapore, where
both companies have big refineries. Exxon and Mobil also each have
plans to build petrochemical plants in Singapore, which are
expected to be combined in a merger.
</P>
<P>
   And with their common roots in John D. Rockefeller's Standard
Oil Co., Exxon and Mobil have been active in Asia for more than a
century. Standard Oil used Singapore as a depot for kerosene in the
1890s _ carrying on a fierce competition with Shell to sell its
bright blue tins.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the neat fit between the assets of the
companies did not extend to strategy. Mobil, they said, had
aggressively built its holdings in natural gas and pipelines in
Asia, while Exxon was content to stick with basic oil production
and distribution. Mobil has also built a thriving business in the
trading of oil _ a business Exxon has eschewed.
</P>
<P>
   Oil trading has enabled British Petroleum and Total of France,
which have few plants in Asia, to generate hefty revenue there.
This summer, British Petroleum announced that it would buy Amoco
for $48.2 billion. On Tuesday, Total said it would acquire
Petrofina of Belgium in an all-stock deal valued at $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil has made a lot of strides in this region while Exxon has
been static,'' Troner, the industry consultant, said. ``Whether we
call it Mobex or Exbil, you can see how the thinking of the two
companies is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Troner said he worried that Mobil's entrepreneurial style in
this region could be tempered by the more cautious and centralized
Exxon. He noted that Mobil's Asian operations _ which range from
natural gas refineries to marketing companies _ all report to the
company's Asian chief in Singapore. Exxon's regional outposts tend
to report individually to its corporate headquarters in Irving,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal may provide lower prices for consumers, it is
grim news for Asian oil companies and oil-producing countries.
Analysts said a number of companies in Thailand and Indonesia were
hoping to extract themselves from financial trouble by selling out
to a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is going to take attention away from Asian assets,
at least temporarily'' said Janet Yang, an energy and chemicals
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. ``And now, these
companies will not only have to compete with Exxon and Mobil, but a
new, leaner company.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven as it is by a plunge in oil prices, the Exxon-Mobil deal
underscores that the Asian oil industry is in dire straits.
Analysts here predicted that oil prices would not recover until at
least the end of next year. That is just one more bit of bad news
for major producing nations like Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei,
which have already been ravaged by financial crisis.

REGULATORS TO INSIST EXXON, MOBIL SELL SOME OPERATIONS BEFORE
APPROVING MERGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   International, federal and state regulators will insist that
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. sell some operations, including
gasoline stations and possibly refineries, before approving the
$75.6 billion merger announced Tuesday by the two giant oil
companies, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators will scrutinze all the operations of the
new Exxon Mobil Corp. _ from pulling oil out of the ground, to
transporting it, refining it and selling it to customers.
</P>
<P>
   But they are expected to be particularly concerned over whether
the dominance of the companies' combined retail gasoline operations
would result in higher prices at the pump, particularly in the
northeastern United States and in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look at it from top to bottom, but certainly the main
concern will be what kind of impact this would have on gasoline
prices for consumer,'' said Ward Tisdale, a spokesman for the Texas
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The company apparently will not make it easy for antitrust
officials. Publicly at least, the merger agreement doesn't offer to
divest assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond said Tuesday that ``we would be
absolutely amazed, although pleasantly surprised, if the (Federal
Trade Commission) said we would not have to rationalize some
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond added that Exxon and Mobil officials were visiting with
FTC officials in Washington ``as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   A commission spokeswoman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators will be paying particular attention to this deal
because of its size and history. Mobil and Exxon were born as the
result of antitrust action _ a landmark 1911 ruling that dismantled
Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller's petroleum empire. The two
companies are the largest of what originally were known as the
``Seven Sisters,'' the companies created by Standard Oil's breakup.
</P>
<P>
   That's analogous to the seven ``Baby Bells'' arising from the
more recent breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil Corp. would become the largest oil company in the
world. The companies are being forced into each other's arms
because they need the efficiencies that the merger would bring to
compete in a world of weak oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that argument will be the key to regulators
ultimately approving the deal. In order to compete with global
giants such as the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, U.S. companies must
grow, and combining forces is the most effective way.
</P>
<P>
   While the companies would have a global reach, analysts say that
federal and state officials are going to be very concerned about
the combined companies' regional activities, particularly in two
areas _ refining and gasoline sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the issues all boil down to one simple question:
Will prices go up as a result of this merger?'' said Stephen M.
Axinn, a New York attorney who advised Texaco in its 1996
acquisition of Getty Oil. ``Anyone who tries to confuse the matter
by making it sound more complicated than that is buffaloing you.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust investigators will seek to determine ``whether Mobil
and Exxon, taken together, have sufficient power to raise prices
without getting their lunch eaten by Phillips, Shell, Texaco and so
on,'' Axinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Mobil was the top gasoline retailer last year,
accounting for 10.85 percent of U.S. gasoline sales, according to
National Petroleum News. Exxon was a close third at 10.39 percent.
Together, they would control about 21 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But both Raymond and Mobil Chairman Lucio A. Noto disputed those
numbers Tuesday, saying their combined market share is closer to
13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What matters more to regulators than the aggregate numbers is
the companies' dominance in particular markets, said Fadel Gheit, a
senior analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Combined, they
might be the largest refining and marketing operation in the U.S.,
but are they largest on the West Coast? No, that happens to be
Arco,'' Gheit said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are particularly dominant in the Northeast.
For example, they would have a combined market share of 40 percent
in six Eastern states, according to the Petroleum Finance Corp., a
think tank for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Exxon Mobil likely would have to divest some of
those assets, selling them off to willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The same would be true for some refining operations. Analysts
pointed to the proximity of the Exxon refinery at Baytown, Texas,
and the Mobil refinery in Beaumont, Texas, as an example, saying
one of them likely would have to go.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity is an issue for the two Texas plants because location
is important in refining. Producers try to move oil to the nearest
refinery to cut costs, so having two major plants so close to each
other could give Exxon Mobil an unfair advantage over other,
competing operations nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a legitimate issue for the Federal Trade
Commission,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon-Mobil deal also will be studied against the backdrop
of other major oil company consolidations, including the British
Petroleum-Amoco deal; the recently consummated joint marketing
venture between Texaco and Shell; and the merger announced Tuesday
between France's Total and Belgium's Petrofina.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, as opposed to the U.S. Justice
Department, is most apt to conduct the antitrust investigation into
the merger, according to William F. Shugart II, a professor of
economics at the University of Mississippi who worked at the
commission from 1973 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart said that the FTC ``has a history with both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon was the target of an FTC investigation into price-fixing
in the oil industry in the 1980s. And the commission looked at
Mobil during its aborted takeover attempt of Marathon Oil in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are roomfuls of documents on Exxon at the FTC,'' Shugart
said. ``Same thing with the Mobil-Marathon merger of about the same
time. They are very familiar with how Exxon and Mobil do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's failure to offer to shed assets at the
outset is ``a bit of hardball'' that could backfire as community
leaders and politicians become nervous about lost local jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``House members representing Texas and other constituencies
where jobs are scheduled for cutting will put pressure on the FTC
to prevent that merger from happening,'' Shugart said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the chairman of the U.S. Senate's antitrust
subcommittee expressed concerns that the proposed merger is part of
an industry trend that will reduce competition and possibly raise
gasoline prices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, said Tuesday
he will ask the Federal Trade Commission to delay its decision on
the proposed merger of British Petroleum and Amoco. BP and Amoco
officials said they hope to finalize the merger by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said
he would investigate and help lead a multistate inquiry into the
proposed merger in order to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who is chairman of the Anti-Trust Committee of the
National Association of Attorneys General, said he wanted to ensure
that the merger would not stifle competition and lead to gasoline
price increases. &QL;

WILLIAM BAXTER, 69, ANTITRUST CHIEF UNDER REAGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William F. Baxter, who as head of the antitrust division of the
Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan brought the sharp
edge of economic analysis to bear on enforcement decisions, died
Nov. 27 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Carol Cairns
Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter was the head of the antitrust division from 1981 through
1983. Despite intense objections of lawyers at the Justice
Department, he dismissed the 13-year-old suit against IBM,
concluding that the government's case made no sense long after IBM
had lost dominance in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter also aggressively pressed AT&AMP;T to settle its antitrust
battle by splitting off the parent company that operated in the
long-distance market from the regional companies that monopolized
local phone service. That decision was vigorously opposed by
powerful members of Reagan's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Joskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, credited the break up of AT&AMP;T with not
only transforming the telecommunications industry but also creating
the ``intellectual template against which other sectors _ like
electric power and natural gas _ would later be reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of
Business at New York University and chief economist at the
antitrust division under Baxter, also credits Baxter with vigorous
prosecution of price-fixing, including prosecuting American
Airlines president Robert Crandall for inviting the chairman of
Braniff Airways to join forces to raise air fares. The suit was
novel because Braniff had rejected Crandall's invitation, leaving
no price fixing for Baxter to prosecute. But Baxter convinced an
appeals court that even an offer to fix prices represented an
illegal attempt to monopolize.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter's colleagues said that merger guidelines issued by his
division in 1982 were his most enduring achievement. Joskow said
that they set a foundation for analyzing mergers both in the United
States and other industrialized countries. The guidelines provided
a clear blueprint for antitrust action. No longer would the
government oppose a merger out of a vague sense that a combined
company lacked competitors or was too large and would squash
smaller concerns. The guidelines established clear questions,
focusing on the effect of the merger on consumer prices, that the
antitrust authorities would need to answer with state-of-the-art
economic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter's decisions on IBM and AT&AMP;T were widely applauded within
the economics profession. But some experts criticized Baxter for
refusing to challenge vertical mergers _ mergers between companies
and their suppliers or distributors _ and so-called vertical
restraints like resale price maintenance _ the practice of
dictating a price below which manufacturers would not allow
wholesalers or retailers to charge. Baxter thought that such
practices rarely harmed consumers because they could turn to
products of other manufacturers. Yet, he said, resale price
maintenance could benefit consumers. For example, it could prevent
discounters from driving out of the market those retailers that
provided extra service, the cost of which could be passed into
their prices.
</P>
<P>
   But even F. Michael Scherer of Harvard University, a critic of
Baxter's attitude toward vertical restraints, said that they were
rarely a significant threat to consumers. Scherer applauded
Baxter's tenure at the Justice Department and said that his merger
guidelines ``put analytic sense into what had been a capricious
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter was born in New York City and spent most of his academic
career at Stanford, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1951,
a law degree in 1956 and joined the faculty of the law school in
1960. He served in the Navy between 1951 and 1954. He served as a
consultant to Citibank and helped write an acclaimed 1977 book on
the economic and regulatory issues emerging from the growth of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter did not back away from controversy. He filed a brief
before the U.S. Supreme Court calling on it to give more leeway to
manufacturers to engage in practices like resale price maintenance
despite the fact that at least one prominent member of Congress was
calling for his resignation over the issue. He declared that the
Supreme Court had based opinions on ``wacko economic propositions''
and that there was ``no respectable academic support for the
outmoded, jerry-built, amateur, pseudo-economic propositions that
underlies some antitrust options.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Temin, an economic historian at MIT who interviewed Baxter
extensively for a 1987 book about AT&AMP;T, said that Baxter was ``very
convinced of his point of view _ not someone troubled by doubts or
introspection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ideological in his approach to antitrust enforcement,
but on balance he exercised very good taste,'' he added. ``He went
for simple, perhaps even Draconian, responses because he recognized
that simplicity was of itself a virtue in the administration of
complex policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Baxter is survived by a stepson,
Bernard Treanor; four children by a previous marriage to Barbara
Metzger Baxter, William F. Baxter III, Marcia Baxter Bearman and
Stuart C. Baxter; three grandchildren; a brother, Donald J. Baxter,
and a sister, Janice Adams.

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who spearheaded
the move for the 1994 law that banned the manufacture of 19 types
of semi-automatic assault weapons, said Tuesday she wants to plug a
loophole in that law next year and impose more federal controls on
firearms.

   Feinstein said recent shootings involving children with firearms
have persuaded her to renew her gun control efforts.

   ``When it gets down to five-year-olds and children bringing guns

   She referred to a five-year-old in Memphis, Tenn., who was
arrested in May after bringing a loaded pistol to school because he
wanted to kill his teacher for disciplining him by separating him
from his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Feinstein noted, a 15-year-old boy from
Springfield, Ore., who had murdered his parents, walked into his
high school cafeteria and fired a semi-automatic rifle with a
50-round clip into a crowd of students, killing two and wounding 22
others.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein acknowledged that ``any legislation with respect
to guns has a tough row to hoe'' in a Republican Congress that has
a history of defeating gun control efforts. ``This is an unfriendly
Congress, but these are ideas that have wide acceptance and make
common sense,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she intends to push a gun control package that
would ban the import of ammunition clips that hold more than 10
rounds. Under a loophole in the 1994 assault weapons law,
large-capacity clips made before the law's enactment continue to be
imported from 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she also plans to include measures that would
require trigger locks on guns to prevent them from being discharged
accidentally, ban inexpensive handguns called Saturday night
specials and call for background checks for firearm purchases at
gun shows or from collectors as well as from dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feinstein said she looking at extending a pilot
program now in Richmond, Va., that requires federal prosecution of
crimes committed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said her gun control crusade stems from her own
personal history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, she escaped an attack by the New World Liberation
Front, a group that had targeted prominent business and political
leaders. The terrorists placed a bomb at the door of her San
Francisco home beneath her daughter's bedroom, but the detonator
failed to work after the temperature dropped below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, terrorists shot out the windows of Feinstein's
beach house near Santa Cruz. After she was told that her first
husband, Dr. Bert Feinstein, was terminally ill with cancer, she
said she got a concealed weapons permit and learned to use a pistol
so she could protect herself at night when she went to see him in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She became mayor of San Francisco 20 years ago after the Nov.
27, 1978, assassination of her predecessor, George Moscone.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened on her first day back as president of the
city's board of supervisors after a leave following Dr. Feinstein's
death. She recalled that she spotted former supervisor Dan White
walking past her office door. White, who had resigned because of
financial difficulties, wanted to reclaim his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan, can you stop? I want to talk to you,'' Feinstein called
out. But White went on, saying, ``I've got to do something first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the shots, smelled the gun powder and he came rushing
by me,'' Feinstein said. Besides Moscone, White also shot and
killed Supervisor Harvey Milk, whose body she found that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible saga in the history of San Francisco,''
Feinstein said. ``For me the assassination was a linchpin event in
my life and in my feelings about weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said she was prompted to fight for a ban on
assault weapons by the July 1993 murders of seven people in a San
Francisco law office who were attacked by a crazed man armed with
such a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is disturbed by ``the absolute enormity of the
amount of guns that float around society and the inability to know
where they are. There are so many weapons it is easy for the
criminal to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, fighting for gun control has been hard
``because the Second Amendment has been construed by some to mean
anybody can possess anything anywhere.''

 &HT;    62,000 gas users select new marketer
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 62,000 Atlanta Gas Light Co. customers have
started buying gas from other companies now that they can choose
alternative suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   As of the start of the month Tuesday, 10 marketers were
supplying gas to homes and businesses previously served by Atlanta
Gas Light, said company spokesman Ross Willis. The total number of
customers who have switched amounts to about 4 percent of Atlanta
Gas Light's 1.4 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 of the 62,000 who changed companies switched in
November, the first full month of competition under the state's new
natural gas deregulation law. Just 9,000 Atlanta Gas customers had
signed up with new marketers when sales officially began Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   When the new law is fully phased in, Atlanta Gas Light will
become a distribution company only and get out of the business of
selling gas.
</P>
<P>
   It will continue selling gas during its transition.
</P>
<P>
   Once 33 percent of Atlanta Gas Light's customers have chosen new
marketers; the rest will be assigned to marketers at random by the
Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the prices Atlanta Gas Light charges its
consumer and business customers are no longer controlled by the PSC
_ only the prices it charges marketers to deliver gas to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company Tuesday posted December rates about 35 percent
higher for gas consumption than the company charged during
November. Charges for delivering gas are unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Willis attributed the increased consumption charge to increases
in wholesale costs customary for high-demand winter months. The
average December bill of $82.54 includes an average gas consumption
charge of $60.68 plus delivery charges of $21.86. Willis said the
total is equivalent to last December's bills.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 marketers that have signed up customers as of Dec. 1 are:
SCANA Energy, Georgia Natural Gas Services, GasKey, United Gas
Management, Shell Energy Services, Columbia Energy Services, NorAm
Energy Management, e prime Peachtree Natural Gas and Infinite
Energy.

AUDITORS RECOMMEND BOTH PARTIES REPAY SOME CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Auditors for the Federal Election Commission have
found that the 1996 campaigns of President Clinton and Republican
Robert Dole illegally benefited from so-called issue advertising
paid for by their political parties. The auditors recommended that
the Dole campaign repay more than $17.7 million, and the campaign
of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore repay $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the auditors' findings coincided with a move by
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to expand their
impeachment inquiry into allegations of campaign finance violations
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors' nearly 500 pages of findings are to come before
the agency's six commissioners for action on Thursday. They also
could be influential as Attorney General Janet Reno nears a Monday
deadline on whether to ask for an independent counsel to
investigate allegations of unlawful spending by Clinton and the
Democratic Party in the 1996 election campaign. At issue in her
decision is the legality of $46.6 million spent by the Democratic
National Committee on issue ads that Clinton and his campaign
consultants helped design.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors, backed by the agency's legal counsel, found
that the party issue ads violated the spending limits of the
federal election laws and should have counted as contributions to
the presidential campaigns. The auditors also said there was
unlawful coordination between the two presidential candidates and
their parties in designing the issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ad campaign is not part of the attorney general's
review because Dole is not a ``covered individual'' under the
independent counsel statute. Reno's looming decision on whether to
seek an independent counsel to investigate the Democratic issue ads
is viewed as pivotal because it touches directly on potential legal
wrongdoing by Clinton, who helped write some of the scripts for the
Democratic ads and raised money to broadcast them.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors reviewed dozens of Democratic ads and found
that three advertisements paid for by the Democratic Party were the
same as ads broadcast by the Clinton campaign. The auditors also
concluded that 37 Democratic issue ads that prominently featured
Clinton ``appeared to convey electioneering messages.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended that the $46.6 million spent on the ads
by the Democratic Party should have counted as in-kind
contributions to the Clinton-Gore primary campaign. The repayment
formula for Clinton is based on the percentage of taxpayer funds
his primary campaign received.
</P>
<P>
   In return for limiting their spending, the presidential
candidates each received $13 million in federal matching funds
during the primary season and more than $60 million for the general
election. The Democratic issue ads began in 1995 and were broadcast
during the primary campaign, while the less costly Republican issue
ad campaign began later and continued after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found that the Dole campaign exceeded its primary
spending limit by $2.9 million and found an additional $14.8
million in issue advertising and other over-spending in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FEC audits the presidential campaigns every four
years and has frequently required repayments to the Treasury, the
amounts recommended by the auditors for 1996, if approved by the
full Commission, would be the largest ever sought from the
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain that the FEC will approve the auditors'
findings. The six commissioners, who are evenly divided along
partisan lines, have wide latitude to make revisions or even to
reject the auditors' recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a majority of four commissioners to adopt the
report. In the past, the FEC has modified the findings of its
auditors. After the 1992 presidential campaign, for example, the
auditors recommended that Clinton repay $4.4 million, but the FEC
approved a repayment of only $1.4 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It would not be at all uncommon for the commission to revise
the findings,'' said Trevor Potter, a former FEC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, an advocate of campaign finance overhaul, was
one of the first lawyers to question the legality of the 1996
Democratic and Republican issue ad campaigns. ``The big question
now is whether the fix is in and whether the FEC commissioners will
pull the rug out from under its very own auditors and override
their findings,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Common Cause, the government reform group,
Wertheimer protested the ad campaigns before the 1996 election and
unsuccessfully pressed Reno to appoint an independent counsel at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Clinton and Dole campaigns have repeatedly
defended the legality of the issue ads and they vigorously
contested the auditors' conclusions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dole campaign lawyers stressed that the Republican National
Committee ``independently designed, produced, and aired the issue
advertisement campaign'' and that the Dole campaign ``did not
direct or control those ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Utrecht, the Clinton campaign's counsel, and Joseph Sandler,
counsel for the DNC, issued a joint statement. ``Rulings of both
the FEC and the courts make it clear that issue ads _ as run by the
DNC _ are legal,'' they said. ``If the commission wants to change
its approach, it must do so through changes to its regulations, not
through a faulty and incorrect legal analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he relied on the legal advice of his campaign's
lawyers and Democratic Party lawyers in approving the issue ads.
Reno is likely to weigh this in her decision on whether to ask for
an independent counsel.

 &HT;    Net stocks gyrating on e-commerce expectations
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The post-holiday buying frenzy is not limited to those
who line up outside the malls before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Internet-related companies kept up their erratic
activity this week. After closing Monday down 3.32 percent, the
Nasdaq composite index closed up 2.79 percent Tuesday. The jump was
the Nasdaq's biggest since Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of local Internet-related companies have been fluctuating
as much as the index. MindSpring, the Southeast's largest Internet
access company, closed at $62.62 1/2, down $1.93 3/4. MindSpring
had a wild Thanksgiving ride, rising $14 to close at $72.12 3/4
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Security Systems, based in the Perimeter Center area,
was down $2.75. The network security company closed at $33.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pre-Christmas season,'' said Jeff Sadler of
Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta. ``And certainly one of the early
e-commerce applications is shopping by the Internet. It's one of
those `if you're not there you're square' applications.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened late last week to Birmingham-based Books-A-Million
is one of the more recent and illustrative examples of the Internet
sector's unpredictability. Two weeks ago, the price of the regional
bookseller was sleeping around $3. Then, last Wednesday, on news
the company's year-old Web site had been revamped, shares shot from
$4.37 1/2 to $14. After a day off for Thanksgiving, the stock went
nutty, closing Friday at $38.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Books-A-Million has settled. Shares dropped $5
Tuesday, closing at $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey's Dave Magee said the stock's volatility last
week was less about the company than the hype surrounding all
things Internet when it comes to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Internet discussion groups are helping fuel the buzz. As of
mid-November, people had posted 3,000 messages this year regarding
Books-A-Million stock on the Yahoo! Finance site. In the past two
weeks, that number more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a lot of hype going on in the Internet
space,'' Sadler said. ``You have a lot of factors. You have
companies without a lot of shares. Then the Internet gets hot, the
company gets speculated upon and there's not a lot of shares to go
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that provide part of the backbone for e-commerce, like
CheckFree, have not reaped the benefit of the stock market's
Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree traded at $6 on Oct. 6, before closing at $17.68 3/4
Tuesday, up $1.43 3/4. CheckFree is trying to make the Internet the
place where you receive and pay your bills.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Koprucki, who covers the company for the Ohio Group, rates
its stock a ``strong buy'' and predicts its shares will trade at
$47 in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``CheckFree is going to be one of the big beneficiaries of
e-commerce,'' he said. ``They, more than anyone, are a beneficiary
of the increased volume and increased traffic. It's been kind of
frustrating in some ways that the stock has not moved more. But it
will.''

 &HT;    Roswell firm tries to open new page in paging business
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The wireless wave is building, and a quiet Roswell,
Ga. company is hoping to be a winner when it crests.
</P>
<P>
   Satellink Communications, founded in 1988, is still a niche
player in a market dominated by the likes of Skytel, Arch and
PageNet, concedes Jerry Mayfield, company president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen companies control 75 percent of the paging
market, with the rest fragmented among several thousand other
companies _ including privately held Satellink, he said. ``But 25
percent is still a big number. There's an opportunity to
consolidate some of those 2,000, and that is what we are looking
at.''
</P>
<P>
   With that growth in mind, the company recently added 70,000
subscribers with the purchase of Cape Fear Broadcasting Cos.,
bringing Satellink's base to about 240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Satellink, which has 300 employees, really has two businesses.
One is a standard paging business, reselling the paging service of
various carriers that hold paging licenses. However, Satellink got
its start in 1988 as an affiliate in the Cue Nationwide Paging
Network, a confederation of companies that provides a paging
umbrella over the United States using part of the frequency given
to FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   A page from Satellink or any other company on the network is
beamed to more than 600 stations. The signal is carried on a
``sideband'' of the station's signal that a pager hears but not an
FM radio. ``It's transparent to the listener,'' said Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Cue's network covers 95 percent of the country's population.
Because the national paging companies are focused on major cities,
Satellink and other Cue affiliates can appeal to people who cruise
the vast spaces in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of truckers,'' Mayfield said. ``If you are
anywhere within range of any stations, you are going to get
paged.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellink handles Georgia, Alabama, western Louisiana and
eastern Texas for Cue. The purchase of Cape Fear Broadcasting adds
Tennessee, Kentucky and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Limited services
</P>
<P>
   The Cue affiliation accounts for about 75,000 Satellink
subscribers, but it has a limited appeal. The Cue network permits
only phone calls to a pager and lets the caller leave only a string
of numbers _ no more than a dozen digits. No pager-to-pager
messaging, no voice messages, no return messages from the receiving
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a niche business,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's a good business, the company's long-term growth
more likely will come by extending its second business from mere
paging to the more muscular use of technology that appeals to
professionals and business people.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications are increasingly being used to carry
numeric pages, written messages, data, voice conversations and even
links to the Internet. While Satellink owns no wireless licenses,
it can resell those kinds of services, combine them in a variety of
ways and run them through its own high-speed switches.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that strategy, the company now offers a feature
called Starnet that lets customers use one number for services that
include paging, voice mail, calling card long-distance and the
``find me'' function that tries a series of phones looking for the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pushing to be an enhanced paging and communications
service,'' Mayfield said. ``We want to take that one phone number
and do a lot of things with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts for some time have predicted a one-number feature will
become hot, but similar services from BellSouth and others have not
taken off. While declining to critique BellSouth's PowerCall
feature, Mayfield said he believes a well-marketed approach can
work for Satellink _ especially in the places ignored by the big
companies. And unlike its FM-based service as a Cue affiliate,
Satellink has no geographic limits on its other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a market for enhanced services in the smaller area,''
he said. ``We could go anywhere we want to with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellink was founded by Mayfield, Marc Comeaux, who is no
longer in management, and Robert Poche, who is currently senior
vice president. The company registered for an initial public
offering of stock in the spring but withdrew when the market took a
dive. Eventually the company will need cash and will get it either
by IPO or private investors, Mayfield said.

 &HT;    A little rah-rah at Virtual High School
 &HT;    By Diane Loupe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Next fall, students at 17 Georgia high schools will go
to class in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   They will sit at a computer, access the Internet and follow the
directions of a teacher in another state, possibly another time
zone. Courses will include such offerings as Native American
cultures, business in the 21st century and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The students will ask questions, participate in group
discussions and submit homework entirely by e-mail. They will earn
full academic credit for the classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia schools are among 100 nationwide preparing to join
the Virtual High School project, a Concord, Mass.-based program
with a $7.4 million federal grant to develop challenging Web-based
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 700 students at 40 high schools in 15 states and four
countries are taking Web-based courses through the program, said
school director Bruce Droste.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at each of the participating schools take an online
course on how to design and develop courses for the program. Then
they develop the course.
</P>
<P>
   When the classes are offered starting next fall, each teacher or
team of teachers will get up to 20 students. In exchange, up to 20
students from that school will be able to take a virtual class,
said Georgia Associate State Superintendent Bob Bellamy, who is
coordinating the Virtual High School program for the Georgia
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you ever do to change the teaching dynamic is rearrange
the desks, you really haven't changed much,'' said Bellamy. ``This
is a pilot effort to look at new, better and different ways of
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In his search for ``something innovative and different,''
Bellamy found the Virtual High School project, which has a solid
reputation nationally because it adheres to high academic
standards, comparable to those of the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools, the major regional accrediting agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Georgia college students are currently taking
online courses, and many Georgia students participate in classes
given by an instructor over a television screen, this is the first
large-scale program in Georgia for Internet classes, Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
   Druid Hills High School librarian Nancy Clark and social studies
teacher Arthur O'Neill have recruited students at the DeKalb County
high school to help them build the Web page for the multimedia
course they are developing. The class will teach students how to
create and design Web pages and use presentation software and audio
and video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, an educator with 25 years of experience, thinks the
online courses will appeal to and be appropriate for students of
many different abilities, not just those who are gifted and
self-motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are students who need that hook to grab them and draw
them into the intellectual exchange,'' said Clark. ``They are not
drawn to the written word on the page. They are drawn to the
images, to the ability to point and click, to the keyboard. It is
much more interactive because it involves so many senses.''
</P>
<P>
   The online courses will enable a student to take special
interest or advanced courses, such as Stellar Astronomy or
Microbiology, which might not otherwise gather enough students to
be offered at a small school. It will also offer an eclectic
variety of electives, with such titles as Folklore and the
Literature of Myth, Magic and Ritual, Exploring Spanish Culture on
the Internet, and Russian, Soviet and post-Soviet Studies. Teachers
in Ware County and Clarke County are collaborating to develop a
course in African-American literature.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual High School's developers say online courses resemble
seminars more than traditional lecture-and-text courses, and

 &HT;    Fulton banks on financial system readiness
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fulton County says it'll be ready for the millennium.
And Jarvis Aldridge, the Y2K program manager for the county,
indicated there won't be interruptions facing those who depend on
the county to provide medical and welfare benefits along with other
check-based forms of financial help.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the systems, all financial systems, that have top
priority within our Year 2000 program. Testing should be completed
by the second quarter of next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources of Y2K risk for the county's mainframe computers include
3.9 million lines of in-house computer code, six programming
languages and 4-to-5 supporting languages.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are about 3,500 PCs in 500-plus offices, divided
evenly between stand-alones and those that are networked. In all,
these PCs use about 200 different desktop software products.
</P>
<P>
   What systems are mission critical? About 120-plus mainframe
applications and about 24 mid-range applications. Some are in
remediation; some will be tested in the first quarter. It'll be
done in stages and finished by the third quarter, Aldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its official optimism, the county faces two hurdles:
Money and a maze of different vendors to contact.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County has spent the $5.5 million budgeted in 1998 to
solve Y2K. The county had planned to spend another $9 million in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But, whoops, a recently discovered $85 million shortfall in
overall county revenue has put the Y2K budget in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the county's systems are mostly maintained by
vendors, a plus in the instance of those who provide Y2K upgrades,
but a minus for the county, given the sheer number of suppliers
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County has depended on about 10,000 vendors in the past
ten years. These suppliers may or may not be compliant and may or
may not still be in business.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge said the county has a dedicated group working on vendor
management and cited the example of the staff having contacted Ford
Motor about county vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But there's much to do. The county, for instance, has not yet
coordinated any activities with Georgia Power.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the matter of embedded chips, those potentially
date sensitive slivers of silicone that could knock-out phone
systems, elevators, traffic lights, hospital equipment and all
manner of automated devices used by the county.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge said Fulton County has inventoried about 10,000
automated devices, representing about 3,000 different types.
</P>
<P>
   The county plans to replace its vulnerable embedded chips but
has as yet to devise a comprehensive testing strategy. ``But that's
part of our program that will be produced within the coming year,''
Aldridge said.

   Temporarily vacant private homes in London can be a reasonably
priced and comfortable alternative to the city's hotels. Go Native,
a London company, offers more than 150 fully equipped and furnished
homes there, including a warehouse apartment overlooking the
Thames; lofts and studios in Clerkenwell, Soho and Bloomsbury;
apartments and townhouses in Chelsea, Little Venice, Knightsbridge
and Notting Hill; a houseboat on the Thames, and a cottage in the
former stable block of Kensington Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $602 a week for a studio apartment five
minutes' walk from Sloane Square, based on $1.72 to the British
pound, to $4,300 a week for a five-bedroom townhouse in Chelsea.
Most homes are one- or two-bedroom apartments in the $860 to $1,720
range.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners include lawyers, artists and diplomats, many of whom
live abroad or in the country and use their city homes only
occasionally. Others live in London most of the time and rent out
their homes just a few weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Prices include weekly maid service and all utilities. Telephone
calls are charged separately. Every guest is met at the home on
arrival and checked out on departure. The agency is available 24
hours a day. Homeowners supply a guide to the best of local
amenities such as restaurants, markets and parks.

   American Viking Lines has begun offering European-style ferry
service twice a week between Tampa, Fla., and Progreso, Mexico on
the Yucatan coast. The 630--passenger vessel Scotia Prince also
operates as a cargo ship. It departs from Tampa on Tuesdays and
Fridays and leaves Progreso on Sundays and Wednesdays. The trip
takes 36 hours. Two decks carry cargo as well as passengers' cars
and recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cabins on the Scotia Prince, which are described as utilitarian
rather than luxurious, come with or without toilets and bathrooms;
suites are also available. The ship has a sun deck with a bar and a
fully equipped casino. Passengers pay separately for meals, which
are served in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   American Viking also offers one-day tours in Mexico. Progreso is
about 20 miles from the colonial city of Merida and within driving
distance of Chichen Itza. Tours are also available to the Celestun
National Wildlife Refuge and to the town of Uxmal. Tour packages
can be bought on the ship and include transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip fares are $124 a person, double occupancy, for cabins
with sinks only and $144 a person for cabins with full bathrooms.
Prices for the suites had not yet been set in late November, but
are estimated at about $100 higher. An extra $199 is added to ferry
a car. One-day tours vary in price from $57 to $79.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast buffet costs $7.95; the dinner buffet, $14.95. A
four-course a la carte dinner runs $19.95. A beer or glass of wine
costs $3 to $6.

   For a decade or more, Miami Beach has been restoring its famed
Art Deco hotels, making them as much a tourist attraction as the
wide beach. This month, what is described as the first major new
hotel built in 30 years is to open on that famed spit of beach and
bravura.
</P>
<P>
   But the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, at 16th Street and Collins
Avenue, four blocks from the convention center, didn't start from
scratch. It combines a new 17-story, 700-room beachfront tower with
the restored 100-room St. Moritz, which was built in 1939 and has
been closed for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel will open its doors by the third week of December,
with a grand opening scheduled for March 6.
</P>
<P>
   The total of 800 rooms includes 74 suites. Rooms have touches of
Art Deco, Palm Beach and Caribbean style; the St. Moritz rooms,
which are smaller than the new tower rooms, will have elaborate
moldings and ceiling coves. Most tower rooms have balconies.
</P>
<P>
   The 85,000 square feet of space for meetings and parties will
include two ballrooms and a multitiered lawn for outdoor
entertaining. There are six restaurants and lounges, including
Preston's in the new tower, serving American fare (entrees run from
$14 for the grilled portobello patty melt to $36 for the
goat-cheese-stuffed rack of lamb), and the Gaucho Room, an
Argentine restaurant with other South American influences in the
St. Moritz section ($17 for the trout to $21 to $28 for American
and Argentine steaks).
</P>
<P>
   The 4,500-square-foot fitness center will offer a range of
equipment and aerobics classes. Besides the 900-foot-wide beach,
swimmers can float in the free-form pool surrounded by tropical
gardens and 20 cabanas served by butlers. Valet and self-service
parking for 1,000 cars will be available in an underground garage
and mostly in a lot across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Major facilities and services will be up and running this month,
according to Debra Kelman, a spokeswoman for Loews, but cosmetic
work like landscaping may not be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Through Jan. 3, the Loews Miami Beach is offering a rate of $199
a night for standard rooms; normal winter rates will be $309 to
$499. Suites cost $600 to $5,000. Reservations: (800) 235-6397 or
(305) 604-1601, fax (305) 531-8677.

 &HT;    Coverdell re-elected to Senate leadership
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans on Tuesday returned their
leaders to power for another two years, re-electing Sen. Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) as majority leader and Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) as the
number five player in the six-man team.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the House, where House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) resigned and other posts changed hands in the wake of the
Nov. 3 elections, the Senate leadership elections were remarkably
calm.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) successfully defeated a challenge
by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) to chair the Senate fund raising
committee in the GOP's only contested leadership election. Hagel,
who said the party needed leaders capable of delivering a clearer
message, was defeated 39 to 13 in the 55-member GOP conference,
with three absences.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, also returned most of their leaders to
leadership positions. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who barely won
re-election Nov. 3, succeeded retiring Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) as
minority whip, the number two position behind minority leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Torricelli (D-N.J.) assumed the chairmanship of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, taking over from Sen. Bob
Kerrey (D-Neb.), who is mulling a possible presidential bid in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from both parties are responsible for fashioning the
legislative agendas of their parties, developing legislative
strategy and ensuring the re-election of their members in election
years.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Coverdell's re-election as conference secretary
assumes larger significance in the wake of Gingrich's resignation
from the House. Coverdell is now the only member of the Georgia
delegation in the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in a position to carry the ball forward, but
obviously any state that loses the speakership _ that is a big
change for us,'' Coverdell said. ``It puts an added responsibility
not only on me but the entire delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond broad generalities, both parties declined to offer much
in the way of specific legislation that they will pursue when
Congress re-convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans will focus on reducing the size of
government, giving married couples some tax relief by removing the
so-called marriage penalty and improving education. Lott pledged to
work more closely with Republican governors in shaping policy and
legislation, a tacit acknowledgement of critics who charged that
Congress ignored the pragmatic conservatism of many GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he is anxious to address the future insolvency of
Social Security, but indicated that he will wait for President
Clinton to come forward with a plan for fixing the retirement
system before initiating anything in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lott blamed the GOP's failure to gain seats in the Senate Nov. 3
on the party's inability to deliver its message to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have an agenda that reflects what the American people
want, and we do,'' Lott said. ``But we have got to do a better job
explaining it.''

 &HT;    Western Show a forum for digital technology
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For Mike Wearsch, the big cable TV convention
that starts in Anaheim, Calif., today is something of a technology
fashion show. The vice president of Atlanta-based Antec's digital
systems comes to see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make sure to check out the competition,'' explains
Wearsch, whose company supplies hardware to the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   His crosstown rival, Scientific-Atlanta President and Chief
Executive James F. McDonald, adds, ``You go for the visibility with
customers. If you want to participate in this industry you have to
be at the Western Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 cable TV industry executives are expected to attend
this year's Western Show, today through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This show is shaping up as especially important to Atlanta's
media and high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the show's focus is on the rise of new digital
technologies that use the cable industry's fiber optic networks to
carry everything from telephone calls to television shows to
computer data. Many of these new services are being developed by
Atlanta high-tech hardware companies such as Antec and
Scientific-Atlanta and delivered by hometown players such as Cox
Communications and Knology.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also a home to cable programmers, such as Turner
Broadcasting and the Weather Channel, which are represented at the
Western Show.
</P>
<P>
   This year's show comes as the industry completes its first full
year for commercial rollout of these new digital services. A lot of
the convention is expected to focus on how well these services have
sold and how to refine them to sell even better.
</P>
<P>
   There are, for example, now more than 300,000 people using cable
industry modems that connect personal computers at ultra fast
speeds to the Internet. A key question for the industry is, will
this number likely grow at a faster pace or has it peaked?
</P>
<P>
   For Cox Communications Chief Executive and President Jim
Robbins, the answer is the market for cable modems is young. He
says his company can't distribute the modems fast enough in its
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for us is getting enough trained people to handle
the business,'' says Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne, owner of Atlanta's largest single cable system, is
also offering cable modems and telephone service. It's coming to
the Western Show to scout out new technology and channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for ways to push the signal faster down
the backbone of our system,'' says Ellen Filipiak, MediaOne's
senior vice president of the Atlanta region. That's cable-speak for
speeding up the workings of MediaOne's system.
</P>
<P>
   Filipiak also has two other special interests this year. She's
wondering how soon cable modems can be sold in retail stores such
as Circuit City. Right now, her company and most operators lease
them to subscribers. MediaOne has more than 2,000 cable modem users
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Her other interest is high-definition television, or HDTV. At
present, MediaOne and most other cable operators are not equipped
to carry this digital signal, which offers super sharp images and
CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   But HDTV requires a new television set to receive the signal,
and prices for it start at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a chicken-and-egg kind of thing,'' says Filipiak.
``There aren't many people who can receive the signal yet but we
want to be ready to send it when they are. We're closely following
consumer acceptance of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big issue at the show is cable telephony, the industry's
network to provide telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cox Communications and MediaOne are already doing so. And
Antec has just sold $900 million in telephone equipment to AT&AMP;T,
which will use it to provide service through cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. AT&AMP;T is in the process of buying the
country's second largest cable TV operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to tap into a huge new business,'' says
Antec's Wearsch, who also provides service to Cox Communications.
``We will demonstrate Internet telephone service at the Western
Show,'' says Wearsch. ``But it still needs a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cable operators, such as Comcast, are delaying offering
telephone service, hoping they can eventually do so at a lower cost
through the Internet.

 &HT;    Cox Communications converts 65,000 cable users into digital
service subscribers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Cox Communications has persuaded more than
65,000 of its cable TV customers to sign up for its new digital
television service in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   While representing only a small portion of the Atlanta-based
company's 3.8 million cable subscribers, this figure is big enough
to encourage both Cox Communications and the cable industry to
press on with the new generation of digital services.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers have definitely exceeded any business plan that
I ever submitted about digital television,'' said Lynne Elander,
Cox Communications director of product development.
</P>
<P>
   Elander made the comment to a roomful of cable TV programmers
who had come to see a demonstration Monday of the company's new
digital services at its Orange County, Calif., system.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications staged the demonstration as a preview to the
Western Show, an industry convention which will be held today
through Friday here.
</P>
<P>
   Elander told the programmers Cox Communications had now rebuilt
about one-third of its total cable plant to carry two-way digital
signals. These lines pass some 1.5 million households nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company now offers digital television in eight markets and
plans to add another three markets in the coming months, says
Elander. Most of the new digital customers are located in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   She says Cox Communications is adding digital customers, who pay
up to $11.95 extra month for the service, at a rate of 1,500 to
2,000 a month. At that rate, Cox Communications expects to sell
digital services to between 25-30 percent of its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're careful not to draw long-term conclusions from
these initial findings, we're delighted,'' says Virginia Gray, Cox
Communicatons' vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is digital television doing better than in the company's
Orange County system, where it was initially offered on Oct. 29,
1997. The system serves a largely affluent population, many of whom
already have computers and use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is also offering its 222,000 Orange County
customers high-speed access to the Internet and telephone service
through its digital cable system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first traditional cable market to get voice, data
and television simultaneously through a cable wire,'' says Elander.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has been closely studying those who buy its
digital services. What it has found so far is digital services are
driving up television watching.
</P>
<P>
   That research shows digital customers are watching about 10
percent more television than they did before. And they are spending
50 percent of their viewing time with digital channels.
</P>
<P>
   What people are watching more of is movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are driving up digital television,'' says Elander.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movie lover's product.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unexpected finding, given movie channels represent a
big part of the digital services' 200 channels. And entertainment
has traditionally driven consumer acceptance of new technology into
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Take computers, for example. It was the rise of exciting
multimedia games, coupled with falling prices, that drove their
entry into homes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The television writer and producer Rod Serling died 23 years
ago, but watching him in action today is as engrossing as taking in
one of his fanciful dramas. Maybe more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fifth dimension,'' he says at the start of each
episode of ``The Twilight Zone,'' the famed science fiction series
that ran from 1959 to 1965 and was his signature. ``It is the
middle ground between light and shadow, between science and
superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the
summit of his knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   That the words still stand as one of the more memorable
utterances of American popular culture is largely because of the
way Serling spoke them _ smoothly and resonantly, with the smug yet
winning assurance of a man with absolute knowledge of a product and
how to sell it. In fact, when he was talking to potential
advertisers about ``The Twilight Zone,'' that was exactly how he
referred to it: ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   As caught in ``Treasures of the Twilight Zone,'' a new pair of
digital video disks from Panasonic Interactive Media, Serling is a
man of both artistic and pragmatic dispositions. On the disks are
six half-hour episodes, including the pilot (``Where Is
Everybody?''), biographical material about Serling and the show,
and several features with the man strutting his stuff, so to speak,
in front of tough audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these clips, called ``Pitches,'' Serling talks to
Madison Avenue about his new show. In honor of the audience,
presumably Oxford wing-tipped corporate types, the little address
begins behind a desk but soon repairs to props arranged around the
set. Serling, all faintly condescending brilliance and speaking
with that renowned punchy articulation, strides to a bucket of
sand, which he spills dramatically across a table. Slowly he sifts
some through his hand. Viewers are to imagine a desert on an
asteroid in space and the nightmarish loneliness of a man stranded
thereon.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation moves on, with Serling leaning jauntily against
a huge camera. Lightning flashes and thunder rolls. Serling puts on
that little grin. Imagine a little Faustian tale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best part is that Serling remains rather likable.
For a fuller picture, the disks include an interview with Mike
Wallace in 1959. Wallace asks Serling, the writer of epic
television dramas like ``Requiem for a Heavyweight,'' if he is
selling out by undertaking a popular series, which will inevitably
mean concessions to advertisers and mass tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Serling replies that throughout his career, he has acquiesced in
only a few minor instances. Wallace notes that both Paddy Chayevsky
and Gore Vidal left television when it became too oppressive. Has
Serling thought about becoming a novelist? Serling disarmingly
replies that he's not sure he could make it outside television,
then defends his decision succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling something commercial isn't putting a tag on it that it
stinks,'' he says.

IBM POSTPONES DEADLINE FOR BIDDING ON GLOBAL NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Extending the auction for one of the most attractive
communications systems yet put on the block, IBM has postponed the
deadline for companies to submit final bids for its global
communications network until Dec. 8, executives close to the
bidding said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, expected to raise between $4 billion and $5
billion, was originally scheduled to close Dec. 1, the executives
said, but IBM pushed back the deadline to allow bidders to become
more comfortable with their final offers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp., the United States' largest communications carrier,
and GTE Corp. are among the four companies that remain seriously
interested in acquiring IBM's international network, said the
executives close to the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, GTE and IBM declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the world's No. 1 computer maker, said in September that it
was exploring the potential sale of its communications network to
focus on its equipment, consulting and electronic commerce
operations.
</P>
<P>
   IBM would use complicated resale and lease-back arrangements to
continue to offer communications services to customers after a
deal. (In fact, much of the traffic on the IBM network consists of
the company's internal corporate communications.) But IBM would not
bear the burden of maintaining and operating the network itself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most valuable elements of the IBM network are its
banks of local telephone modems around the world, tied together by
international fiber-optic lines. It could take years for another
company to replicate IBM's local systems, country by country.
</P>
<P>
   That is why as many as 24 companies were initially invited to
participate in the auction, though only a dozen progressed past the
first round. According to executives close to the bidding, among
the communications carriers that subsequently dropped out were
Qwest Communications International Inc. and the Global One venture,
which includes Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest and Sprint declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirled around Wall Street and the telecommunications
industry earlier this week that AT&AMP;T had offered around $6 billion
for the IBM network, but executives close to the bidding said such
reports were inflated and premature.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some analysts said Tuesday that AT&AMP;T could
potentially be seen as a front-runner in the competition for IBM's
system, partly by virtue of its sheer size, which could allow it to
pay more for the network and still make it profitable. And Michael
Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, could be in a unique position to
understand what IBM likes in a suitor. He worked at IBM for three
decades.

 &HT;    Georgia governor-elect hopes to use Maryland plan as example
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening had a message Tuesday
for governor-elect Roy Barnes: You can put the brakes on suburban
sprawl and live to see re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening garnered national attention last year when he
expended enormous political capital to pass the state's Smart
Growth program, which Barnes hopes to emulate in Georgia in some
form. Glendening was in Atlanta to share his experiences with a
national conference of state environmental and transportation
officials, who are meeting together for the first time to talk
about how to curb sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The principle behind the Maryland program is simple: the state
will no longer pay to build schools, sewer lines, government
buildings and the like on farm and forest land when existing
developed areas can handle new growth.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Growth was greeted with jubilation by many advocacy
groups, but not so by home and road builders, who went after
Glendening during his re-election campaign this fall. ``They
attacked us, and some who had supported us stopped supporting us,''
Glendening said. But in the end he won by 170,000 votes, a larger
margin than his first election.
</P>
<P>
   To pass Smart Growth, Glendening and his staff spent several
months laying the groundwork with county and city governments.
Glendening, who was county executive of Prince George's County,
Md., before becoming governor, said he headed off certain rebellion
among county officials by leaving most decisions about how to grow
in local hands.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires counties to designate urban zones where growth
will be focused at ``livable'' densities, defined as an overall
average of 3.5 housing units per acre. State infrastructure money
is then directed to those places, rather than to pristine areas at
the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as local governments follow their own plans, they get
the money,'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   From Glendening's perspective, Maryland has squandered billions
of dollars chasing development farther afield even as cities and
inner suburbs deteriorated. He noted that Montgomery County had
closed 60 schools in older areas over the last 20 years while
spending a half-billion dollars to build 60-plus schools in new
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The state historically spent 57 percent of school construction
dollars in new suburbs. It's now spending 84 percent for expanding
and refurbishing existing schools, Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland is also redirecting transportation funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, this nation has generally dealt with congestion
issues (by asking) `How can we move more cars farther and faster?''
Glendening said. ``Smart Growth, by contrast, demands that we take
a more people-oriented, more community-oriented view that actually
asks the heretical question, `How can we reduce the need to use the
car?''' He said Maryland is beefing up its mass transit budget and
has set up a fund to pay for streetscape improvements and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   John Frece, Glendening's special assistant for Smart Growth, met
Tuesday with two Barnes aides charged with helping to craft
legislation for the Georgia legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear they are interested in trying to addresss this
issue right out of the box,'' Frece said. ``In Maryland we found
the need to lay the groundwork and listen to alot of constituencies
before we went into it. I don't think we would have been successful
if they hadn't been consulted. But on the other hand, if the stars
are in alignment here, maybe they would be right to do something
right away, given how fast Atlanta is growing and how long it takes
to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint meeting of the Environmental Council of the States and
the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials ends today.

WEATHER THAT MAROONED FILM CREW ENDANGERS ARCTIC RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The three-man film crew -- a Japanese television
producer, Australian cameraman and a Russian wildlife expert --
were marooned in an isolated Arctic wasteland, cut off from rescue
by subzero cold, perpetual blizzard conditions and the advancing
polar night.
</P>
<P>
   They had spent the past six weeks holed up in a cabin on Cape
Blossom, the cruelly misnamed tip of Vrangel Island. This dark and
stormy patch of land 300 miles northwest of Alaska is paradise for
the polar bears they had come to film, but a frigid hell for
humans.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the trio planned to leave. Tens of thousands of
Russians who live in the Arctic tundra face a winter without
adequate food and fuel to survive the brutal conditions because of
the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While the ordeal of the film crew resembled something out of a
Jack London story, their escape Tuesday was closer to Tom Clancy.
As the crew kept in touch with embassies, colleagues and loved ones
by satellite phone and the Internet ( To send e-mail!), a Russian
Mi-8 helicopter braved a blinding snow squall to snatch them and
their 800 pounds of cargo safely away to the Siberian mainland port
of Pevek.
</P>
<P>
   There, as the relieved crew members gave their first interviews,
an Arctic tragedy of far greater proportions was unfolding,
overshadowed by the dramatic events of the film crew's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Russian citizens live in settlements along the country's far
northern and eastern coasts, forced to endure winter conditions not
much better than those on Vrangel. Once well paid by the Soviet
state to live in one of the harshest environments known to man,
these people have faced seven straight years of plunging living
standards in Russia's chaotic post-Communist economy. They too are
stranded by their newfound poverty and Russia's inability to create
a working program to resettle them. And this year, they have found
their food and fuel supplies nearly cut off because of Russia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit is the Chukotka region where Pevek is located, a
barren tundra land of about 80,000 people, rich in gold and little
else, where life expectancy for men in some regions is an
astonishing 34 years old, according to the International Federation
of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these regions are in a desperate state,'' Oleg
Chestnov, Director General of the Russian Red Cross, said last week
before a Red Cross delegation left for Siberia to study how to best
channel aid to the region. ``It is imperative that we bring help to
people who are on the verge of extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, there has been talk of evacuating entire towns in
Chukotka, including Cape Schmidt, a settlement of 5,000 across the
icepack from Vrangel Island where outside temperatures can drop to
as low as 45 below zero. As autumn set in this year, the town found
itself with no fuel to heat homes.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike producer Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, cameraman John
McGuiness and Nikita Ovsyannikov, the helicopters will not be
coming for anyone in Chukotka anytime soon. After a tour of the
region last month, Russia's Emergencies Ministry declared the
situation manageable. The regional government, which wants to build
up the local gold mining industry, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no plans to shut down towns,'' said Ivan Bagromov, a
spokesman to the region's governor, Alexander Nazarov, who plans to
travel to Chukotka this week to see how his constituents are
getting by.
</P>
<P>
   In Pevek, spirits were boosted Saturday when a Finnish tanker
loaded with 13,400 tons of fuel finally made port. The ship had
been expected in the summer, but the local government's cash
troubles because of the crisis delayed its departure from the Kola
penninsula in northwestern Russia until Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Like the film crew, who were supposed to leave Vrangel in
mid-October, the ship was delayed by early winter weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards,'' the film crew's Ovsyannikov told Russian NTV
television from Pevek.
</P>
<P>
   The same stormy weather left the tanker stuck in heavy ice.
There it stayed until a Russian atomic-powered ice-breaker was able
to free it.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will have fuel in Chukotka, once the fuel can be loaded
off to towns like Cape Schmidt on the beaten paths that pass for
roads there. But places that recently received shipments are
running out again. Petropavlovsk-Kamchatkatsky, a city of 300,000
and the capital of the Kamchatka penninsula, has a two-day supply
of fuel left. An local electric company official told Russian
television Tuesday that schools, kindergarten and hospitals would
be without power in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the penninsula in the Koryag region, home to 28,000,
there is not only a lack of fuel, but also medicines and qualified
doctors to stem a tuberculosis outbreak, said Tatyana Mekhed, an
aide to the region's governor.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Misnik, who heads the committee on arctic affairs in
Russia's lower house of parliament, said 10 northern and Siberian
regions, home to some 12 million people, are seriously short of
supplies this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Misnik also opposes evacuation, not because he thinks people
should live in the harsh cold and poor conditions, but because the
only places open to evacuees from Siberia are dormitories in other
poor Russian regions. When the state has tried to close towns and
move people out of the hardest-hit areas, people stay on for fear
of losing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to close the village is made and deliveries of
food and fuel stop, but people continue to live there,'' Misnik,
himself a resident of the Kola penninsula in far northwestern
Russia, said in a recent interview. ``They tear down abandoned
houses and burn the wood for heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of migrant workers a legacy of a Soviet system that
first populated Siberia and the Far East with prison camps, then
tried to conquer these uninhabitable but resource-rich swaths of
land by offering better salaries and working conditions to workers
from other parts of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Misnik and others say the indigenous peoples of the far
northeast are the worst hit. In both the Chukotka and Koryag
regions, native peoples who were forced to abandon their
traditional way of life by the Soviet regime in the 1950s are now
finding it nearly impossible to live under a Russian system that
has eliminated most of the benefits of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The collective farms that took over their ancient reindeer herds
and their traditional whale- and seal-hunting grounds have
collapsed. The subsidies of the Soviet system have disappeared. And
without that, there is no way to support life there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening to the indigenous peoples of northern Siberia
is a tragedy, but people ignore it because it's only a few thousand
people,'' said Mekhed of the Koryag region. ``But the rest of
Russia has all of our problems with just a slightly better climate.
I sincerely hope we are not a model for the future of the whole
country.''

   BOEING-PRODUCTION (Seattle) The Boeing Company Tuesday announced
it will reduce production rates for some of its commercial airplane
programs based upon updated assessments of the Asian economic
crisis and its impact on air travel and airplane customers.
Production on the 747 program is now scheduled to decrease from 3.5
to 2 airplanes per month in late 1999, and subsequently to 1 per
month in early 2000 if market conditions fail to improve. Based
upon updated customer demand forecasts, the 757 program will be
reduced from 5 to 4 airplanes per month and the 767 program will be
reduced from 4 to 3.5 airplanes per month in early 2000. The 777
program, currently scheduled for a rate reduction from 7 to 5
airplanes per month in the fourth quarter of 1999, is now projected
to continue at the lower rate in 2000. The 737 Next Generation is
scheduled to increase to 24 airplanes per month early next year, as
previously announced, and is projected to remain at that rate until
late 2000 when the rate is planned to decrease to 21 airplanes per
month.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The daughter from New York was home for the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   For a little time, that upstairs room was occupied again. And,
especially when she and her sister were together in the house _
their voices and laughter combining in the remembered way _ there
was a sense of the family made whole once more.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them are independent creatures now, with lives and
lodgings of their own. Their childhood friends all have grown to be
men and women, too, many of them with new families already begun.
</P>
<P>
   That is the normal progression _ the way you hope things will
proceed. But having said that, it's still necessary to come to
terms with losses.
</P>
<P>
   What pathetic creatures we parents are! Counting down the days.
Rushing to the airport, all atwitter, excited as if we were meeting
a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was when they used to come home on break from
school. It's that way still.
</P>
<P>
   When they are away, out of sight and occupied with their
affairs, I may resent the clutter left behind _ the full closets,
the heap of cartons and furniture from student years, filling a
garage in which no place remains to put a car.
</P>
<P>
   But when they're here, full of life and light, I can forgive
them anything.
</P>
<P>
   The time's so precious, and there's so much of interest going
on, I find it impossible to do any kind of useful work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a piece of luck to have made my way in the world as a
writer. Because if ever I'd had a real job, I'd surely have lost it
when the first holiday season came around.
</P>
<P>
   The amazement is how quickly the days fly.
</P>
<P>
   A few meals together. The sound of doors opening and shutting.
Footsteps in the hall. With any luck, one or two conversations of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all in a rush, it's finished.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, we were off to the airport again, to the plane that
would return one daughter to that alien city on the distant coast.
</P>
<P>
   And for her sister, it was back to the long hours and working
weekends of a career just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, two again, adjusting to the sudden quiet of the
house and the empty chairs at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holidays are nice,'' one of us can be counted on to say. ``But
it's good to get back to our routine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' the other answers. ``It's fine having the place all
to ourselves _ ourselves and about a hundred cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, in three weeks we'll all be together again for
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks and four days, to be exact,'' the other will say.
</P>
<P>
   Because, you see, we're already counting.

NAZI RECORDS SHOW THEFT OF MONET, FAMILY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The descendants of French Jewish art collector Paul
Rosenberg have more than an old family photo to prove that a Monet
waterlily now on loan to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was looted
by the Nazis in 1940. They also have records that the Nazis
dutifully catalogued his substantial art collection after
confiscating it, the Boston Globe learned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That information emerged after the director of France's national
museum system, which has had the painting for more than a half
century, said that Rosenberg's descendants must prove that the
painting, ``Water Lilies 1904,'' was not sold by Rosenberg rather
than plundered by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear if it was looted or sold,'' Francoise Cachin,
who heads the museum system, said in an interview Tuesday. It is
clear, she acknowledged, that the painting was in Rosenberg's
collection before the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the descendants, some of whom live in the United States, say
they have documents from Nazi files to support their claim. The
Nazis, obsessive about keeping documentation of even their most
heinous crimes, catalogued each of the looted paintings, including
the Monet that is in Boston for an exhibition that runs until Dec.
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenberg family Tuesday notified Cachin's office in Paris
of their intent to claim the artwork, one of 48 signature
waterlilies that Monet did.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation that the painting was looted from Rosenberg and
was then requisitioned for the wartime collection of Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was first reported Monday by The
Globe. The MFA borrowed the work from the French museum at Caen in
Normandy, knowing it was one of nearly 2,000 French artworks that
were recovered from Germany after the war, but whose ownership was
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Cachin spoke as the State Department opened a three-day,
45-nation summit on how to deal with the growing number of claims
for Holocaust-era assets, including art. But the US government made
it clear that the art claims of Holocaust victims must be balanced
against the need for a stable art market _ a signal that American
museums seeking protection against a rash of claims have found a
sympathetic ear at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   And though the conferees are deliberating in private, Lord
Greville Janner, a member of the British delegation, created
discomfort during a luncheon speech to the conference when he
challenged the US view that the conference will be the final
chapter on the asset issue.
</P>
<P>
   Janner, who is chairman of Britain's Holocaust Education Trust,
said there must be a follow-up conference a year from now to ensure
that separate commissions established in many countries _ including
one that President Clinton named on Monday _ will be held
accountable for opening archives and restituting art and other
plundered assets.
</P>
<P>
   Janner's remarks met with disapproval even within his own
delegation. One British conferee, who spoke on condition that his
name not be mentioned, said US State Department officials had
called Janner daily since last week in efforts to dissuade him from
issuing his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not what the Americans wanted, or wanted said. They
want this conference to end the process,'' the conferee said,
adding that the US has been under pressure from its European
allies, especially Germany, to find quick closure to the two years
of international turmoil over issues like Nazi gold and looted art.
</P>
<P>
   It was Janner who was resposible for pushing successfully for
last December's conference in London on gold the Nazis looted in
occupied Europe. And in an interview last week, the former Labor MP
said he also planned to challenge the Vatican to open up its
wartime archives to see what assets, if any, the Holy See might
have received during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the conference, Stuart Eizenstat, the
undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural
affairs, opened the conference with public remarks in which he
stopped short of calling for the restitution of art to victims of
the looting, expressing approval for ``a just and fair resolution
of ownership claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that families that lost art to the Nazis must
have a ``full opportunity to find and reclaim'' those objects. But
in remarks that were being closely dissected in art circles, he
also called for a ``speedier and far less confrontational
resolution to the problem of looted art. ... The international art
market must be open, stable, free of uncertainty that it might be
trading in works that are tainted by Nazi looting.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Rosenberg perspective, if not from Cachin's, there is
no uncertainty to the Monet claim.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, Elisabeth Rosenberg Clark,
speaking for the family, said the late colllector/dealer's family
has no desire to interfere with the exhibition of the painting at
the MFA. The 85 Monets in the exhibition, ``Monet in the 20th
Century,'' are scheduled to move to the Royal Academy of Art in
London at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But Cachin, the French museum director, said the Monet will be
returned to Paris after the Boston exhibition, where the claim will
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   By the family's account, the claim is a strong one. In September
1940, just after Rosenberg had fled southern France to Portugal,
and eventually to New York, Hitler's art-looting units descended
upon two caches of his valuable collection, 162 paintings in a bank
vault in Libourne in the south of France and scores more paintings
at a family home in Bordeaux. The Monet waterlily was at the
Bordeaux home.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank, Nazi officials even left a receipt for the French
bankers, listing each of the 162 paintings. At the home, they
simply carted off the artworks. But all the artworks were trucked
to the Jeu de Paume, a Paris museum. It was there that the ERR _ an
acronym for the art-looting unit _ catalogued each of Rosenberg's
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The family believes that it was at the Jeu de Paume where von
Ribbentrop, along with other top Nazis, including Field Marshal
Hermann Goering, took their pick of the looted collections for
their own homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   When the painting was repatriated after the war, French
officials failed to learn its connection to Rosenberg, even though
the French government's own 1947 list of missing artworks lists the
painting, notes Rosenberg's ownership and even cites dimensions
that are identical to the Monet. Despite those clues, the painting
was eventually shunted off to Caen, where it has been in the
collection since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In October, after the family asked the Art Loss Register to help
it locate 58 missing artworks, a Register official, Sarah Jackson,
took the family photo to the Witt Art Library in London. There, she
compared it to photos of Monet's waterlilies. In just under three
hours, Jackson said Tuesday, she matched the photo to the artwork
in the custody of the Caen museum.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the Globe published an article about the
painting's uncertain ownership and an accompanying photo, Jonathan
Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore, matched it
to a photo of von Ribbentrop's Monet that is included in his book,
``Art as Politics in the Third Reich.''

 Start at top to bring real change  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Earlier this year, shocking stories about the
Kansas City Fire Department surfaced during a federal sexual
discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that strippers performed at fire stations,
female employees were fondled and on-duty firefighters watched
X-rated videos.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Ortrie D. Smith found
``blatant and inexcusable'' episodes of harassment and ordered
every department member to undergo educational training.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories emerged this month in a preliminary draft report
prepared by 9to5, National Association of Working Women. The
organization has been conducting sexual harassment and diversity
training for the Fire Department as part of the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 15 percent (in the training sessions) responded that
no woman can do the job,'' the preliminary report said. ``The
overwhelming majority expressed concern about having a female loved
one work in the department, not only because of general safety
issues, but because of the way women are treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports like these would send many, if not most of us, out the
firehouse door in search of another job. So perhaps the biggest
surprise is not how widespread harassment is at the Fire Department
but that those working toward change are optimistic about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news that came out of this training is that there
were people eager to make change happen,'' said Ellen Bravo,
co-director of 9to5, National Association of Working Women.
</P>
<P>
   Change is possible, but it takes time, commitment and
leadership, said Maggie K. Finefrock of the Learning Project, an
organizational development firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do this work if I didn't believe institutions could
change, but institutions don't change until people change,'' she
said. ``If training is done in isolation, it usually does not work.
You have to have the top people committed, and they have to be
willing to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations, she said, must start by collecting
data and listening to people so that they can identify problems.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to identify what the ideal culture would be and
what actions need to be taken to build that environment. Those
plans need to be a part of an organization's long-term plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bottom line is we're all prejudiced, we all prejudge,''
Finefrock said. ``I think people have been socialized to think of
women in one box and men in another box.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice: We need to recognize these stereotypes and move
beyond them. We need to be willing to go out on a limb and say: ``I
am offended by what you said or did.''

ARMY GIVES DELAYED HONOR TO WWII PRISONER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. _ In the fall of 1943, Capt. David
Beavers, a 29-year-old dentist and medical officer in World War II,
wrote to his parents: ``Now I know what Grandpa went through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cryptic message, intended to make it past Army censors.
But Beavers knew his parents would understand. Just as Union
soldiers had held Grandpa Charles Beavers prisoner during the Civil
War, German soldiers had held David Beavers captive for six days in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During a surprise ceremony at Fort Leavenworth on Monday, 55
years after his imprisonment, Beavers was honored for having
endured that captivity. Wearing his original brown dress Army
uniform and choking back tears, the retired dentist from
Winston-Salem, N.C., accepted his honor humbly, thanking his
presenter before turning his attention to the 50 or so soldiers in
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who've gone before you should be very proud of
(all of you),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had received a P.O.W. medal in the mail several
years ago, Beavers' son, Maj. William Beavers, believed his
84-year-old father deserved better. He wanted his father to be
honored publicly, to receive a medal with his name on it. What
better time to do that than on the day William Beavers was being
promoted to major?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's terribly modest,'' Beavers said of his father after the
ceremony. ``So, I'm proud to get to tell the story he wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   William Beavers, who is assigned to the Battle Command Training
Program at Fort Leavenworth, learned much of that story in history
books. Although he'd known his father was held captive, he didn't
know much else. He didn't know where his father had served or much
about what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   What he learned surprised him. His father, a dentist for the
36th Division, which grew out of the Texas National Guard, had
participated in one of the war's major operations: the invasion of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1943, Beavers and thousands of Allied soldiers
stormed the beaches of Sorrento, just south of Naples. Three days
after the invasion, with his unit suffering large casualties,
Beavers was ordered to exchange his dentist's tools for those of a
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, not far from Sorrento, Beavers' battalion found
itself isolated from other troops. German forces saw this and
attacked the battalion on both its right and left flanks.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers heard the rumbling of a tank as he was digging a
foxhole. He turned and found a German soldier ordering, ``Stand
up.'' Beavers had just become one of about 500 Americans captured
that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans took some of their prisoners, including Beavers, to
a nearby school. His imprisonment, Beavers said, was one thing the
Army hadn't prepared him for. But he did know how to use his wits
to get himself out of jams. Almost immediately Beavers began faking
a limp to make his captors think he wouldn't be likely to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sept. 18, with the sun going down, Beavers grabbed a
wad of paper, limped his way past a guard and headed to a latrine
near the school. A few minutes later, a fellow prisoner did the
same. The dark concealed them as they snuck behind some bushes. The
German soldiers, Beavers assumed, simply thought they had gone to
the bathroom, for no one followed them.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four days the two men evaded capture, hiding, on
two occasions, with sympathetic Italian hersdmen and surviving on
stale bread and raw potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   By Sept. 24 Beavers had been reunited with his division.
</P>
<P>
   His brief imprisonment didn't mark the end of Beavers' trials.
Nor was it the only event during the war that earned him honors.
Beavers also received the Silver Star and Bronze Star for risking
his life to save others. His toes suffered frostbite during the
long winter. And he was called upon several more times to abandon
his duties as a dentist to help out with surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on these events after the ceremony, William Beavers
just shook his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't understand or know (all this),'' he said. ``If
I hadn't got a book and started reading about it, I never would
have known.''

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) For decades, Chari House's memory of her father
remained in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get any warmth out of that, or see the love he
supposedly had shown me,'' House said. ``I want every little bit I
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   So she recently commissioned a friend to paint an oil portrait
of her father, based on an old black and white photograph. In
seeking to add color to sepia memories, House is like approximately
500 members of the American WWII Orphans Network (AWON), whose
fathers died in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Once discouraged from asking about their fathers' deaths, the
network's members now resolutely track down details. They overcome
red tape, the indifference or confusion of relatives and friends
and even their own ingrained reticence.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Norman Stahl, 53, a nonprofit-agency
human-resources director in Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl recently saw for the first time the morning report
prepared by the clerk of Company B, 184th Infantry, on June 22,
1945. That's the date colleagues apparently retrieved his father's
body on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   That also was three days after Stahl was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like reaching through the ages and touching my
father,'' said Stahl, who found the documents at the National
Personnel Records Center in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a concrete connection from half a world away, from
somebody who saw what happened and wrote it down.''
</P>
<P>
   As for House, 56, it was on a 1996 visit to the National
Archives in Washington that she found papers detailing how German
soldiers killed her father on Aug. 5, 1944, near Carhaix, France.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Kan., resident wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know what my father was like,'' said House, who
turned 2 years old Aug. 8, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had told me how much he had loved me, but this man
couldn't be God, and he couldn't walk on water. I wanted to talk to
somebody who knew him as a regular person.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional journeys of House and Stahl are similar to those
experienced by other members of the American WWII Orphans Network,
founded in 1991 by Ann Bennett Mix, 57, a Bellingham, Wash.,
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Members sometimes convene, as they did in early November in St.
Louis, to share tips on finding documents. They also console one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the orphans once dreamed of finding their
fathers,'' Stahl said. ``That was very common.''
</P>
<P>
   The network's members have known the occasional dramatic
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   One member used the network to locate a heart-breaking
photograph of his father, slain and face-first in the snow. Though
perhaps less dramatic, many breakthroughs are poignant.
</P>
<P>
   After finding documents, some members search out their fathers'
former colleagues. Finding them can be a mixed blessing, said Mix,
whose father died in 1945 in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   `` `We didn't get to know those new guys, and we didn't want to
know them,' '' one veteran told Mix.
</P>
<P>
   Until late 1943, the government usually passed over fathers with
children. But eventually the military drafted almost a million of
them. Often they were rushed through training.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was sent right over to Italy and brought up to the
front in the middle of the night,'' Mix said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lasted three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the American WWII Orphans Network know that meeting
their fathers' comrades can be uncomfortable. ``A lot of people
died in stupid, unglamorous ways,'' Mix said. ``It's like these men
know things that they believe you would be hurt to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   House's experience has been better. An Internet search led to
her father's executive officer, who found her father's body Aug. 5,
1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me my father didn't have to lead that platoon in, but
that he was the kind of man who wouldn't send other people to do
what he could do himself,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to hear that, because it meant what my mother had
told me had not been made up. She hadn't built him up like so many
orphan families do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day 1997, House saw for the first time the small
leather photo wallet her father was carrying when he was killed. It
included a portrait of herself, at 18 months, sitting with her
mother. Her mother only recently volunteered the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Widows forced to fend for themselves decades before support
groups or grief counselors sometimes don't see the point in
dwelling on the unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't get any help,'' Mix said. ``They just went
on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't easy. Families quarreled over insurance money and
burial details. Mix's mother, for instance, decided to have her
late husband buried in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom signed the papers to leave my Dad overseas three days
before she married my stepdad,'' Mix said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family was furious. They wanted to bring him home. Because
of these fights, I was not allowed to speak to my father's family.
So I not only lost my dad, I lost a whole side of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl wants to learn if his father's name is on a memorial on
Okinawa. He wants to find the man _ or his survivors _ who wrote
his grandfather a letter in 1949, describing his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   He also is considering searching for his father's colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't taken that step, out of fear,'' he said. ``What if
there is no one out there?''

NO THIRD PARTY INVOLVED IN DEATH OF FEDERAL JUDGE AND HIS WIFE, FBI
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA and JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ U.S. District Judge Earl O'Connor and his
wife, Jean O'Connor, probably died in a double suicide or a
murder-suicide, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Connors each were shot once in the torso, investigators
said. Autopsies were performed, but Johnson County District
Attorney Paul Morrison said he would not announce what they
revealed until later this week. The autopsies did not reveal
anything unexpected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is get a handle on whether it's a
murder-suicide or a double suicide,'' Morrison said. ``But I think
everyone is confident that there's not a third party involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI bowed out of the case because investigators were certain
that a third person did not kill the couple. Any attack on a
federal judge falls under the FBI's jurisdiction, so federal agents
were dispatched soon after the 76-year-old judge and his
66-year-old wife were found dead Sunday in their Mission house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to make sure,'' said FBI agent Jeff Lanza. ``You
can't just take things at first glance; you have to jump through
all the investigative hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths produced sorrow and shock among judges and
administrative workers at the federal courthouse in Kansas City,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber said O'Connor was
very devoted to his wife and deeply distressed about her rapidly
failing health. He had spent the last three weeks helping care for
her.
</P>
<P>
   It never crossed anyone's mind that he was considering ending
his life, co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are devastated,'' said U.S. District Judge John W.
Lungstrum.
</P>
<P>
   David B.B. Helfrey, a St. Louis defense attorney and former head
of the federal Organized Crime Strike Force in Kansas City, Mo.,
said he was shocked by the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor presided over several high-profile organized crime
cases tried by Helfrey, and the judge told friends they were among
some of his most interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
   In August, O'Connor set aside the conviction of an Overland Park
car dealer for bank fraud after Helfrey convinced the judge that
the jury was wrong and that there was no fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fairness and sense of justice is unquestioned,'' Helfrey
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bebber said that some of his fondest memories of O'Connor
stemmed from the judges' Tuesday lunches, informal social affairs
to which they brought or ordered in sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor enjoyed telling World War II stories from his days as a
quartermaster officer on ammunition ships and stories about court
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got special satisfaction with the resolution of the Kansas
City, Kansas, school desegregation case,'' Van Bebber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lawyers' judge and a judges' judge. A lawyers' judge
because he was diligent, respectful and even-handed, but in
control. A judges' judge because he was the kind we all try to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tears are easy to come by in this courthouse today.''

EXPERTS SEE FEW ANTITRUST CONCERNS FOR EXXON AND MOBIL

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now comes the hard part for Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies, involved in two of the largest antitrust
challenges in American history _ first at the beginning of the
century with the breakup of the empire of John D. Rockefeller and
then 50 years later in the notorious Oil Cartel cases _ will once
again have to confront antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   While the history of American antitrust law is largely the
history of the oil industry, this time the legal examination
promises to be particularly thorough as authorities from a host of
states will join officials in Europe, Japan and Washington to
scrutinize every aspect of the proposed new leviathan company, from
neighborhood gas stations and regional refineries to pipelines,
trans-oceanic tankers and natural gas and oilfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will undoubtedly be a large, broad and extensive
investigation,'' said Donald Kaplan, a Washington lawyer who led
the Justice Department's global antitrust examination of the oil
industry in the 1970s and 80s. ``There will literally be hundreds
of different antitrust markets they will have to look at. There are
not only many products but also a broad geography to cover. This
will be difficult and expensive, and it will produce a lot of
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with a wave of large and small mergers both pending
and completed in recent months, the regulators will be under
political pressure to make sure that the marketplace does not begin
to lose its competitive edge. Already, the Federal Trade Commission
and European Union are studying the proposed $48.2 billion merger
between British Petroleum and Amoco Corp. and Tuesday another big
deal was announced when Total said it would buy Petrofina in a
stock deal valued at $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts predicted that the issues were not
insurmountable, that the industry had changed in countless ways
since it was controlled by Rockefeller's Standard Oil and that
Exxon and Mobil could complete the deal if they were willing to
shed some important assets.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference detailing the merger Tuesday, Lee Raymond,
the chairman of Exxon who will lead the combined companies, said he
``would be absolutely amazed although pleasantly surprised'' if the
FTC did not order the sale of some assets. Soon afterward, lawyers
for the companies met with FTC lawyers to begin the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have retained two of Washington's largest law
firms to handle antitrust issues before the FTC. Exxon has hired
Covington &AMP; Burling, and the team will be led by Charles Rule, a
former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Mobil
has retained Hogan &AMP; Hartson, where it will be headed by Janet
McDavid, incoming chairman of the American Bar Association's
section on antitrust law. At Georgetown University, Ms. McDavid was
a law student of Robert Pitofsky, who is now the chairman of the
FTC, and she was a member of a Pentagon task force on antitrust
issues, which he headed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. McDavid and Pitofsky served on President Clinton's
transition team in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Exxon and Mobil have been big players on the
Washington political scene, although antitrust lawyers said Tuesday
that the staff members of the FTC who review mergers strived to be
insulated from political pressure. The most recent statistics, for
the year 1997, show that Mobil spent $5.3 million on lobbying and
Exxon spent $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's announcement, some consumer and industry
groups announced their intention to challenge the merger on
antitrust grounds, and state officials announced their intention to
begin a broad inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning an investigation in coordination with other
states,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who
is head of the antitrust section of the National Association of
Attorneys General.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is this combination of two giants, even if it is
designed to increase their strength globally, could have an immense
impact on consumers on Main Street. Exxon and Mobil were created as
part of the breakup of the Standard Oil monopoly, the very reason
we have today's antitrust laws,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kaplan and other antitrust experts predicted that the
antitrust issues would not block a merger, a sign of the
transformation of the oil industry from the time it was controlled
by the innovative trusts devised by Rockefeller at the end of the
last century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers and analysts said that significant divestitures might be
required in the retailing and marketing end of the business and in
the production of petrochemicals and lubricants but that the deal
could ultimately be approved by regulators. The area of the
business least vulnerable to antitrust action is in oil
exploration, where competition is robust, foreign governments play
a large role in setting prices and significant technological
innovations in drilling have sharply lowered the capital costs that
had once posed a formidable barrier to newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust law has been shaped by trends in the oil industry. The
Supreme Court's most notable ruling in the field came in 1911, when
the court divided Rockefeller's Standard Oil into 34 separate
companies by interpreting the Sherman Antitrust Act as prohibiting
any business combination that unreasonably restrained trade and was
not in the public interest. The decision prompted the court's sole
dissenter, Justice John Harlan, to complain bitterly that the court
had put ``words into the antitrust act which Congress did not put
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest surviving pieces were Standard Oil of New
Jersey _ later renamed Exxon _ and Standard Oil of New York _ later
Mobil _ which came under government scrutiny again after World War
II after the completion of a detailed analysis by the FTC titled
``The International Petroleum Cartel.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, the Eisenhower Administration filed the Oil Cartel
case, contending the two Standard Oils and three other companies
were participating ``in an unlawful combination and conspiracy to
restrain interstate and foreign commerce of the United States in
petroleum and products.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Standard Oil of New Jersey signed a consent
decree as part of the oil cartel cases in which it agreed to not
join forces with the leading competitors in the world oil market,
including Standard Oil of New York. That agreement also broke up
the two companies' joint ownership of the Standard Vacuum Oil
Company, a leading producer and refinery of oil in the Far East.
The consent decree lasted 25 years, expiring in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the largest divestures of that time,'' recalled
Robert Bicks, a lawyer in Manhattan who was an assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division
during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. ``It was the
first of the foreign commerce cases that recognized the connection
between what happens abroad in the oil business and prosperity and
competition here.''

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES DRIVE STOCKS BACK UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks bounced back Tuesday, led by a strong recovery
in prices of computer-related and Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   Major market indexes, which posted their worst one-day declines
in two months on Monday, sagged further during morning trading. But
the averages started to firm around midday, and during the
afternoon buyers entered the market, especially for large cap
issues that trade on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is being fueled by technology stocks, where there
is renewed interest,'' said Dan Eagan, a portfolio manager at
Blackrock Funds, a subsidiary of PNC Bank with about $3 billion
under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking seems to be that the hype about the Internet
stocks has given the technology sector more room to improve its
profit margins,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by big gains in benchmark issues like Microsoft, Intel and
Cisco Systems, the Nasdaq composite index rose 54.21 points, or 2.8
percent, to 2003.75. It was the biggest gain for the index since
Oct. 15, and restored a great deal of what was lost on Monday, when
the index fell 66.90 points.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, moves in other market measures were much more
modest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 100 points
early in the session, reversed course and closed at 9133.54, up
16.99 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 11.65 points, or 1 percent, to 1175.28. And
the Russell 2000 index of mostly small cap companies eked out a
gain of 0.99 point, or a quarter of a percent, to 398.74.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in the Dow would have been bigger but for a slide in the
price of Exxon, which fell 3 5/16, to 71 3/4. Investors not only
seemed disappointed with the company's $99-a-share, $80 billion
takeover plan for rival Mobil &UR; ,  &LR; but also with a further decline in
oil prices, which fell to new 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in oil prices provided some more vitality to the bond
market, where yields on 30-year Treasury securities fell to 5.04
percent, from 5.07 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who say the market has little room to advance further
admit that bonds are providing a positive framework for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond yields are lower, and that is positive, but I still think
the market is exhausted,'' said Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity
strategist at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the good news is at hand: The buyers are back, and it
seems foreign investors, which pretty clearly have a big-cap,
technology bias to their buying, are also back in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the drop in bond yields, Cliggott says that according to
his valuation model, stocks are now about 2.5 percent overvalued, a
level he concedes is ``not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's performance was viewed as encouraging partly because
in the wake of Monday's big selloff, Asian and European equity
markets moved sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   The declines were particularly pronounced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The London Stock Exchange, the largest in the region, fell 3.6
percent. French and German markets each fell by more than 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed much of the decline to profit taking
following big gains in recent weeks, and to concerns that major
central banks are unlikely to cut interest rates further before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purposes, European markets were closed by the
time stocks began to rally in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer, seen by many
as the cornerstones of the technology sector, were standout
performers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the biggest software company, rose 7 1/2, to 129 1/2.
Intel, the biggest chip maker, rose 7 3/8, to 115. Cisco Systems,
which is building much of the Internet's infrastructure, gained 4
3/8, to 79 3/4. Dell rose 4, to 64 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, battered on Monday, partly regained lost ground
on renewed optimism about strong holiday sales at retail Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! gained 14 1/4, to 206 1/4. Amazon.com jumped 17 1/2, to
209 1/2. Wavephore, a broadcaster of news to personal computers,
saw its shares jump 7 1/2, a 97 percent increase, to 15 1/4 after
the company introduced a shopping channel and said it will adopt a
technology allowing it to charge users for certain broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Herrman, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, an
Overland Park, Kan., money manager with about $27 billion under
management, said he believes the market is overpriced but that the
momentum seems to favor higher valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think money flows will continue to present a positive
prejudice to the tape until sometime in the first quarter,'' he
said. ``If the economic news is not too constructive by February,
then some fear might come back.''

BUILDING TECHNIQUES GIVE CONCRETE HOMES SOLID PROSPECTS FOR
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENEXA, Kan. _ From the outside, the home looks like many others
along the winding streets in the Cedar Creek development _ large
and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath its sheath of stucco, however, it is unlike any of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being framed in wood, as are more than 90 percent of
the homes in this country, this $800,000 house was framed with
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that it doesn't look different than other
homes around here, that it doesn't feel like a cell,'' said Keith
Eymann, president of Ambassador Construction. Ambassador is
building the house of insulated concrete foam, a process that fills
Styrofoam blocks with concrete.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing prisonlike in this 4,700-square-foot,
French-country design home that is still under construction. It has
19-foot ceilings, a country kitchen and a master bedroom closet
that could serve as a den in some homes. Other accoutrements play
off its concrete theme, such as its concrete tile roof, stamped
concrete drive and walks, and the molded concrete tops being
fabricated for its kitchen cabinets. It also is being wired for all
of the high-tech tools and toys.
</P>
<P>
   The house is being built to introduce the Kansas City market to
what advocates of concrete homes consider their superior attributes
_ sturdiness, energy efficiency and quietness, with no sacrifice in
distinction, delicateness or style.
</P>
<P>
   Not by chance, the house is being financed by Ash Grove Cement,
one of the country's largest makers of cement, the key ingredient
in concrete. Ash Grove owns the Cedar Creek development.
</P>
<P>
   While the home is a speculative venture, built without a buyer
on hand, Charles Sunderland, an Ash Grove vice president, is
unshaken in his belief that a concrete home will sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a demonstration home, a prototype for what we
hope is the home of the future,'' Sunderland said. ``It is a house
of the new millennium _ comfortable living with the latest
technology. We think it is the kind of house everyone would have if
they could get someone to build exactly what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of concrete homes in the United States remains
small, the homes inhabit a solid place in American building
history.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete barn built by editor Horace Greeley was converted
into a home by his daughter. Thomas Edison patented a system that
allowed an entire concrete home, including stairways and roof, to
be cast in less than a day. Of the 11 built in 1908, several
survive. Concrete construction was essential for American architect
Frank Lloyd Wright's most famous home, Fallingwater, near Mill
Creek, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such celebrated advocates, concrete construction homes
never really caught on in the United States, although they have
been popular in Europe. Of the 1.1 million new homes built last
year, about 7 percent were framed in concrete, according to figures
from trade associations. That is up from about 3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of concrete homes think that when builders and
consumers get used to the idea of homes made from insulated
concrete foam, they will be impressed by their soundness and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   They say the superior insulation, tightness and wall mass of
concrete homes make them more energy efficient, cutting down on
drafts and keeping temperatures more even. The tightness of a
concrete home, paired with an air filtration system, can be a
selling point to those with respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that concrete homes are fire-resistant, can stand
up to severe weather and screen out more noise than traditional
wood-frame homes. Yet, with new construction techniques, they can
be built in any design that a wood-frame home could be built. When
covered inside with drywall and outside with any building material,
they are visually indistinguishable from wood-frame homes.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete construction will add $1 to $4 per square foot to the
cost of building a home, but that expense can be offset by lower
energy and insurance costs, Sunderland said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Donnelly, president of the National Lumber and Building
Material Dealers Association in Washington, disputes the claim that
a concrete home can stand up better in severe weather. ``If
constructed properly and fastened properly, wood-frame homes will
withstand hurricane-force winds,'' he said. ``We have proof of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly also disputes... MORE

CLINTON, DOLE ADS MISUSED PUBLIC FUNDS, AUDITORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two years of politically charged campaign
finance investigations, a federal audit released Tuesday found that
both the Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns illegally used
millions of dollars in public funds on television ads.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended that the Dole campaign repay the
Treasury $17.7 million for the violations, while the Clinton
campaign should pay $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The audit is likely to have two immediate results. First, it
could put pressure on Attorney General Janet Reno to seek an
independent counsel to look into the issue by Monday, the deadline
for her decision whether to take that step. Second, with the House
Judiciary Committee expanding its impeachment probe to include
campaign finance, Democrats might well suggest that any such move
include a new look at alleged Republican abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, performed by auditors for the Federal
Election Commission, said both parties spent millions of dollars on
``issue ads'' that were thinly disguised efforts to boost the Dole
and Clinton campaigns. Such issue ads are supposed to be for
generic party-building purposes, not for the election of a certain
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen anything like this before,'' said Don
Simon, executive of Common Cause, after reviewing the audit. ``This
is a deliberate assault by both campaigns that resulted in truly
massive and unprecedented violations of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to the much-publicized probe into foreign campaign
contributions and the investigation of President Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, Simon said, ``this is the
most important scandal that we have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the campaign finance focus in the last two years
has been on alleged Democratic abuses, the report underscores that
both campaigns possibly violated the federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Dole campaign repayment of $17.7 million was much
higher than the Clinton campaign amount of $7.5 million because
Dole's alleged violations occurred mostly in the general election,
when the FEC requires a dollar-for-dollar repayment. For exceeding
spending limits during the primaries, the rate of repayment varies
and is often around 25 percent. In fact, the Clinton campaign
exceeded the spending limit by a higher amount than Dole, but
Clinton's violations occurred mostly during the primary season,
when the repayment requirement is lower, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended repayments will be reviewed when the FEC meets
Thursday. The six-member panel, equally divided between Democrats
and Republicans, could vote to accept or modify the proposed
penalties. The commission also could impose civil fines against the
political parties totaling tens of millions of dollars. In the
past, the commission has often rejected or modified staff
recommendations and lowered proposed repayments.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, the FEC in 1992 required repayments of $364,000
from the Bush campaign and $1.4 million from the Clinton campaign
for various offenses. Those amounts were reduced from the staff
recommendation of $1.6 million for the Bush campaign and $4 million
for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Clinton and Bob Dole could come up with the
money to repay the Treasury since it is difficult to convince
people to contribute to campaigns after an election. Both Clinton
and Dole have said they believe the issue ads were legal and they
did not violate the law. The Democratic Party said in a statement
Tuesday the audit was based on a ``faulty and incorrect legal
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Clifford May predicted
the FEC would reject the audit. ``We followed all the relevant
laws,'' May said. ``These were not campaign spots. These were RNC
spots, and I think the commission will recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions about the use of issue ads since they
first aired in the 1996 campaign. Under a strategy developed partly
by Clinton, the Democratic National Committee ran ads that
criticized Republicans and showed pictures of Dole. The Democratic
Party said the ads fell into the generic ``issue'' category because
they did not explicitly call for the election of Clinton or the
defeat of Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans soon responded with similar ads that attacked
Clinton without calling for the election of Dole. Both the Clinton
and Dole campaigns said the ads were legal because they did not
include a reference to which candidate should be elected. But the
transparency of the ads was evident even to Dole, who said in June
1996: ``It never says that I'm running for president, though I hope
that it's fairly obvious since I'm the only one in the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC audit spells out how both campaigns allegedly broke the
law in using the ads.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, for example, the Republican National Committee ran
an ad that said Clinton's spending on illegal immigrants went up
while wages for the typical US worker went down. In response, the
Democratic National Committee ran an ad saying Clinton had
increased border patrols to catch illegal immigrants. The audit, in
a section that referred to the DNC commercials, said the ads were
part of a ``deliberate effort to conceal the actual purpose and
strategy behind the advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the political parties coordinated the ads with
the campaigns, and the ads sometimes were nearly identical to those
run by the campaigns, the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit was released as the Justice Department and the House
Judiciary Committee are focusing on the same issue. Republicans for
months have criticized Reno for not asking for the appointment of
an independent counsel to look into whether Clinton and his aides
engaged in a broad conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, which has been holding hearings on
whether Clinton should be impeached as a result of his relationship
with Lewinsky, voted Tuesday to issue a series of subpoenas related
to the campaign finance probe. Republicans on the committee have
said they want to learn why Reno so far has rejected advice from
FBI Director Louis Freeh and former Justice Department official
Charles LaBella that an independent counsel be named.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who chaired
campaign finance hearings last year, said in an interview that the
audit provides one more reason for Reno to appoint an independent
counsel by Monday's deadline. While Thompson said alleged
Republican abuses should be examined as well, he stressed that
Democrats started using issue ads long before the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is Democrats started with this plan and
raised millions of dollars in their issue ads before Dole was out
of the blocks,'' Thompson said. ``If Dole engaged in that later, so
be it, but you are talking about watermelons vs. green peas in the
significance of it.''

BUILDING TECHNIQUES GIVE CONCRETE HOMES SOLID PROSPECTS FOR
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENEXA, Kan. _ ....``We have proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly also disputes any claim that concrete is more
environmentally friendly than wood. ``You have all of the
environmental issues related to the cement-making process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The energy efficiency of insulated foam concrete homes impressed
Craig Wolfe, an officer with the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club
and a former builder of passive solar homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sierra Club is very aggressively trying to protect
old-growth forests on federal lands, and this would fall in that
category,'' Wolfe said. ``On the other side, and I am not informed
enough to answer this, but what are the resources that this system
uses and what is their impact on the environment?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland counters that the resources needed for concrete are
among the most abundant on Earth and that the amount of land needed
to make concrete is a fraction of that used to cut lumber.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, a spike in lumber prices and improvements
in the insulated concrete foam process kindled interest in the
homes, said Lionel Lemay of the Portland Cement Association.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike standard concrete blocks, which have often resulted in
homes that had the look of bunkers, the insulated forms easily can
be cut to shape a home from the simple to the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows for features like bay windows, cantilevers and
curves,'' Lemay said. ``That is another reason people are
gravitating to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The forms used by Ash Grove are made from 17-inch-by-48-inch
Styrofoam blocks that have 2-1/2-inch thick walls and a 6-inch
interior space. The blocks have plastic webbing inside and
interlocking edges. They can be stacked, braced and filled with
steel reinforcing bars and then concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little like building with Legos,'' Sunderland said.
</P>
<P>
   The foam remains when the concrete cures, adding to air and
sound insulation. Plastic seams on the blocks allow attachment of
drywall. A hot knife is used to cut grooves in the foam for the
insertion of wiring or plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost gap between wood and concrete frame construction
narrowing, the concrete industry has begun promoting its process.
It has urged companies such as Ash Grove to build homes that could
speak to a growing interest in safe and environmentally sensitive
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Ash Grove and other members of the local Concrete Producers
Association built a small concrete home for the local Habitat for
Humanity housing program last year to demonstrate that the process
is viable for inexpensive homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that house came on the market, I would buy it,'' said
Winston Slider, executive director for Habitat for Humanity Kansas
City. ``I think we proved it is an affordable way to go for a
less-expensive house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slider said the energy efficiency of the home was amazing. He
thinks once the word gets out about the technology, consumers will
be eager to build concrete homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland said there had been a lot of interest in the new
Cedar Creek house and the process. Ash Grove sponsored barbecues
where about 600 architects, engineers and builders were encouraged
to poke around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the decorative touches, the house is being wired with
high-tech extras. The subdivision is wired with fiberoptic cable,
and the house will have an ISDN high-speed telecommunications line.
For show purposes, it will have at least two large-screen
televisions hooked to WebTV technology, as well as a couple of
computer terminals, all linked on an ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Getting contractors and subcontractors to embrace concrete
construction is as important as getting consumers to buy in, Lemay
and Sunderland said.
</P>
<P>
   Subcontractors are so busy now building traditional-framed
homes, they have no incentive to learn a new technique. Eymann
enticed one of his subcontractors to take on the job, and Ash Grove
paid for the crew's two-day training on the concrete process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get it more in mainstream,'' said the cement
association's Lemay. ``We need to show people that it is available
to them and show the builder that the consumer is willing to pay
for the benefits.''

CLINTON TO ANNOUNCE NEW WATER PURITY RULES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will travel Thursday to Newport,
R.I., to announce new federal measures to improve the quality of
drinking water and authorize the release of hundreds of millions of
dollars in loans to help states upgrade their water treatment
facilities, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations focus on eliminating the most harmful
pollutants in tap water, such as the cryptosporidium microbe, a
parasite that contaminated Milwaukee's water supply in 1993 and
sickened 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are part of amendments to the Safe Drinking
Water Act, which Clinton signed into law in 1996. The measure
significantly tightened standards for clean water and authorized
billions of dollars in a revolving loan fund over seven years to
improve deteriorating water systems.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stay, Clinton will tour the Bliss Mine Road
water purification plant in Newport and visit Fort Adams State
Park, where Narragansett Bay will serve as the backdrop as he lauds
the state for its comparatively high-quality water treatment
system.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be joined by Senator John H. Chafee, a
Republican from Rhode Island who co-authored the water act
amendments and is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires local water authorities for the first time
to annually disclose what chemicals and bacteria are in drinking
water and to give public notice within 24 hours of discovering a
dangerous contaminant in the water system. The measure also creates
a program to fight pollution at its source by keeping streams and
rivers clean and improving facilities that treat water before it
comes out of the tap.
</P>
<P>
   Citing data from the Centers for Disease Control, Chafee said
that about 900,000 people get ill each year from parasites such as
cryptosporidium, which causes most people to suffer cramps and
intestinal disorders. He said about 900 annually die from the
illness, particularly those with AIDS and weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The parasite is commonly found in lakes and rivers, especially
if the water has been contaminated with sewage or animal wastes.
Often it enters the water system during or after stormy weather
when sewers overflow.

NAZI RECORDS SHOW THEFT OF MONET, FAMILY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The descendants of French Jewish art collector Paul
Rosenberg have more than an old family photo to prove that a Monet
waterlily now on loan to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was looted
by the Nazis in 1940. They also have records that the Nazis
dutifully catalogued his substantial art collection after
confiscating it, the Boston Globe learned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That information emerged after the director of France's national
museum system, which has had the painting for more than a half
century, said that Rosenberg's descendants must prove that the
painting, ``Water Lilies 1904,'' was not sold by Rosenberg rather
than plundered by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear if it was looted or sold,'' Francoise Cachin,
who heads the museum system, said in an interview Tuesday. It is
clear, she acknowledged, that the painting was in Rosenberg's
collection before the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the descendants, some of whom live in the United States, say
they have documents from Nazi files to support their claim. The
Nazis, obsessive about keeping documentation of even their most
heinous crimes, catalogued each of the looted paintings, including
the Monet that is in Boston for an exhibition that runs until Dec.
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenberg family Tuesday notified Cachin's office in Paris
of their intent to claim the artwork, one of 48 signature
waterlilies that Monet did.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation that the painting was looted from Rosenberg and
was then requisitioned for the wartime collection of Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was first reported Monday by The
Globe. The MFA borrowed the work from the French museum at Caen in
Normandy, knowing it was one of nearly 2,000 French artworks that
were recovered from Germany after the war, but whose ownership was
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Cachin spoke as the State Department opened a three-day,
45-nation summit on how to deal with the growing number of claims
for Holocaust-era assets, including art. But the US government made
it clear that the art claims of Holocaust victims must be balanced
against the need for a stable art market _ a signal that American
museums seeking protection against a rash of claims have found a
sympathetic ear at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   And though the conferees are deliberating in private, Lord
Greville Janner, a member of the British delegation, created
discomfort during a luncheon speech to the conference when he
challenged the US view that the conference will be the final
chapter on the asset issue.
</P>
<P>
   Janner, who is chairman of Britain's Holocaust Education Trust,
said there must be a follow-up conference a year from now to ensure
that separate commissions established in many countries _ including
one that President Clinton named on Monday _ will be held
accountable for opening archives and restituting art and other
plundered assets.
</P>
<P>
   Janner's remarks met with disapproval even within his own
delegation. One British conferee, who spoke on condition that his
name not be mentioned, said US State Department officials had
called Janner daily since last week in efforts to dissuade him from
issuing his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not what the Americans wanted, or wanted said. They
want this conference to end the process,'' the conferee said,
adding that the US has been under pressure from its European
allies, especially Germany, to find quick closure to the two years
of international turmoil over issues like Nazi gold and looted art.
</P>
<P>
   It was Janner who was resposible for pushing successfully for
last December's conference in London on gold the Nazis looted in
occupied Europe. And in an interview last week, the former Labor MP
said he also planned to challenge the Vatican to open up its
wartime archives to see what assets, if any, the Holy See might
have received during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the conference, Stuart Eizenstat, the
undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural
affairs, opened the conference with public remarks in which he
stopped short of calling for the restitution of art to victims of
the looting, expressing approval for ``a just and fair resolution
of ownership claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that families that lost art to the Nazis must
have a ``full opportunity to find and reclaim'' those objects. But
in remarks that were being closely dissected in art circles, he
also called for a ``speedier and far less confrontational
resolution to the problem of looted art. ... The international art
market must be open, stable, free of uncertainty that it might be
trading in works that are tainted by Nazi looting.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Rosenberg perspective, if not from Cachin's, there is
no uncertainty to the Monet claim.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, Elisabeth Rosenberg Clark,
speaking for the family, said the late colllector/dealer's family
has no desire to interfere with the exhibition of the painting at
the MFA. The 85 Monets in the exhibition, ``Monet in the 20th
Century,'' are scheduled to move to the Royal Academy of Art in
London at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But Cachin, the French museum director, said the Monet will be
returned to Paris after the Boston exhibition, where the claim will
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   By the family's account, the claim is a strong one. In September
1940, just after Rosenberg had fled southern France to Portugal,
and eventually to New York, Hitler's art-looting units descended
upon two caches of his valuable collection, 162 paintings in a bank
vault in Libourne in the south of France and scores more paintings
at a family home in Bordeaux. The Monet waterlily was at the
Bordeaux home.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank, Nazi officials even left a receipt for the French
bankers, listing each of the 162 paintings. At the home, they
simply carted off the artworks. But all the artworks were trucked
to the Jeu de Paume, a Paris museum. It was there that the ERR _ an
acronym for the art-looting unit _ catalogued each of Rosenberg's
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The family believes that it was at the Jeu de Paume where von
Ribbentrop, along with other top Nazis, including Field Marshal
Hermann Goering, took their pick of the looted collections for
their own homes and offices.

   When the painting was repatriated after the war, French
officials failed to learn its connection to Rosenberg, even though
the French government's own 1947 list of missing artworks lists the
painting, notes Rosenberg's ownership and even cites dimensions
that are identical to the Monet. Despite those clues, the painting
was eventually shunted off to Caen, where it has been in the
collection since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In October, after the family asked the Art Loss Register to help
it locate 58 missing artworks, a Register official, Sarah Jackson,
took the family photo to the Witt Art Library in London. There, she
compared it to photos of Monet's waterlilies. In just under three
hours, Jackson said Tuesday, she matched the photo to the artwork
in the custody of the Caen museum.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the Globe published an article about the
painting's uncertain ownership and an accompanying photo, Jonathan
Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore, matched it
to a photo of von Ribbentrop's Monet that is included in his book,
``Art as Politics in the Third Reich.''

STUDY LINKS WAIST SIZE, HEALTH RISKS IN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not really overweight? That doesn't avoid the risk of too much
fat in the wrong place, judging from the largest study to date on
how fat distribution affects health.
</P>
<P>
   Women whose waists measure more than 30 inches or whose waist
and hip measurements are nearly the same have double or triple the
risk of heart disease compared to those with smaller waists, even
if their overall weight is not excessive, according to a study
published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The level of risk is comparable to the danger conferred by such
established factors as high cholesterol, high blood pressure,
cigarette smoking, or diabetes, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about shape, not necessarily weight,'' said Dr.
Kathryn M. Rexrode of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the
study's leader.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time studies have suggested that ample girth
_ and especially a high waist-to-hip ratio, meaning the two
measurements are close together _ are independent risk factors for
heart disease. Research in men dating back more than 40 years, and
in women to 1984, has hinted that, when it comes to shape, an
``apple'' profile is more hazardous than a ``pear.''
</P>
<P>
   The news in the current study, which appears in the current
Journal of the American Medical Association, is that the risk of a
large waistline is so high, and that it affects even those who
would not be considered obese by conventional weight-to-height
standards. It also adds considerably to the data on this risk
factor among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The association is stronger than I expected to find,'' Rexrode
said Tuesday. ``A 3-fold higher risk is higher than a lot of other
risk factors that get a lot of attention in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to take the new results seriously is that they
come from the Nurses Health Study, a Boston-based project that has
followed nearly 122,000 American nurses for 22 years. In this
study, Rexrode and her colleagues examined the incidence of heart
attacks and cardiovascular deaths among nearly 45,000 women who
provided regular reports on their waist and hip measurements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier studies were much smaller and less sophisticated,''
said Dr. Richard Karas, director of the Women's Heart Center at New
England Medical Center. ``This study gives us more confidence that
an increase in abdominal girth is an independent risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexrode and her colleagues found that women whose waist-to-hip
ratio was 0.88 or higher had more than a three-fold higher risk of
a heart attack or death from heart disease over an eight-year
period, compared to women with a ratio of 0.72 or less. (A woman
with a 30-inch waist and 34-inch hips has a 0.88 ratio.)
</P>
<P>
   Although a waist measurement of 30 inches was associated with a
two-fold higher risk of heart disease, and a waistline of 38 inches
with a three-fold risk, the researchers found that the waist-to-hip
ratio was a somewhat more reliable measure of heart disease risk.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of excess abdominal fat seemed to be independent of
other risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are not sure why abdominal fat poses a higher risk
than fat elsewhere. ``All fat is not the same,'' Karas said. ``It's
derived from different cell types as the body develops and may
actually have different physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexrode said that ``abdominal fat seems metabolically more
active'' and its metabolic byproducts have a greater effect on the
amount of cholesterol in the blood, on circulating insulin, and on
the body's resistance to insulin.
</P>
<P>
   She said doctors should be more aggressive about advising diet
and exercise for an individual with a high waist-to-hip ratio, and
also about lowering other cardiovascular risk factors when
individuals fail to shed abdominal fat despite dieting.

EXXON, MOBIL REUNITE WITH A LONG HISTORY OF SUCCESSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighty-seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court busted John D.
Rockefeller's fearsome oil empire into 34 separate pieces, the two
largest chunks are reuniting to form the largest oil company in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. _ known earlier in their existence
as Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York,
respectively _ have negotiated a $75.6 billion deal that will
create a corporate behemoth with 123,000 employees and $200 billion
in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are historic twins that were separated early in life,''
said Ron Chernow, autor of ``Titan,'' a critically acclaimed
Rockefeller biography. ``This is an extraordinary event.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight decades since their separation, the ``twins'' have
pursued different paths. And in that time, they have developed
distinct personalities.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing clue can be found in their corporate histories.
``A Brief History of Mobil Corporation'' does not include the words
``Standard Oil'' until the 12th paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   As if to distance itself from the old man's ghost, it spends
more than a page talking about Matthew Ewing, the man who founded
Vacuum Oil Co. A maker of kerosene and lubricants, Vacuum was
successful, but nothing on the order of Standard Oil, which bought
the company in 1879. Rockefeller made Vacuum a part of Standard Oil
of New York and set it on course to being the corporate giant it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mobil, Exxon makes no bones about its link to
Rockefeller. ``Standard Oil'' is in the first sentence of ``A Brief
Informal History of the Exxon Corporation.'' On the first page
alone, the words ``Standard'' or ``Rockefeller'' appear a dozen
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon history tells how the Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that
the various Standard Oil companies were a centrally controlled,
illegal monopoly. Rockefeller's empire was dismantled and the
separate companies became truly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surviving piece by far was Standard Oil of New
Jersey _ now Exxon. At the moment of the breakup, it constituted 43
percent of the old company. The second biggest piece, Standard Oil
of New York, was a mere 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup made Jersey Standard the biggest and wealthiest oil
company in the world. As its corporate history implies, the company
did not set out to shatter the mold that made it such a force to be
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon is a chip off the old block,'' Chernow said. ``Over its
history, Exxon has been very conservative, disciplined, secretive
and methodical _ just like Rockefeller himself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of lingering personality traits of the company, which
changed its name to Exxon in 1972, is an appetite for being the
biggest and most powerful company in the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell has leapfrogged Exxon as the world's biggest
oil company. But when it completes the purchase of Mobil, Exxon
will again stand atop the world's energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon enjoyed being No. 1 in the world,'' said Carol
Freedenthal, principal of the energy consulting firm Jofree Corp.
``They are used to being No. 1. I am sure they didn't like being
No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon also has a long-standing reputation for being
conservative. The company has followed other, more adventurous
companies into deepwater exploration. It avoided places like
Indonesia because of the political turmoil and geological gambles
involved. But Exxon has extensive exploration ventures in Russia, a
risky place if ever there were one, proving no oil company can
explore for oil and be totally risk averse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon is very conservative. It doesn't like to take chances,''
Freedenthal said. ``Big Oil has always been conservative. Part of
their conservatism is that old fear of antitrust proceedings. They
are afraid the government will take notice and change the
regulations. They want to avoid government intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   As the biggest U.S. oil company, and therefore a prime target
for regulatory action, there are advantages to avoiding a
free-wheeling, swashbuckling reputation. But being secretive has
come back to haunt Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   When the Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil
in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989, the sight of pristine
coastlines and sea animals coated in black goo shocked the world.
For days, while the story played on front pages around the world,
Exxon's chief executive made no public appearance to express his
remorse. The company seemed to hide behind a wall of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valdez was a screw-up for Exxon because they did not publicly
come out and face the music,'' Freedenthal said.``They took a
legalistic approach, and it hurt them badly.''
</P>
<P>
   When Houston lawyer Dick Miller was representing Exxon in some
lawsuits with insurance companies concerning the Valdez debacle, he
asked to talk to the company's chief executive. Company officials
refused, something Miller has never encountered at any other
company, large or small. Disgusted at the bureaucratic
interference, the high-powered attorney quit in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his experience, Miller isn't sure his anecdote proves
anything about Exxon. ``I don't think they are all that much
different from other companies, except they are bigger and have
more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Vestiges of the company's secretive nature have remained in the
1990s, even after the lessons of Valdez. When a spokesman was
queried in 1994 about a company plan to sell oil leases in the
southern United States, she replied, ``If we didn't put a press
release out about it, it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While Exxon may struggle to shake off some of the limitations
imposed by its past, it has brilliantly exploited the advantages of
its birthright. Exxon has never shied away from using its bulk and
its wealth to its utmost advantage.
</P>

 &HT;    Vols regain the soul of their defense
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ On the field or in your face, Al Wilson is as
straightforward as his name. Yes, he's feeling much better. After
missing most of the Kentucky game and sitting out Saturday at
Vanderbilt, Wilson's pulled groin has healed nicely. So this
Saturday night, he'll be comfortably back on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not 100 percent,'' said Wilson, the senior middle
linebacker and soul of top-ranked Tennessee. ``But who knows? When
my adrenalin gets flowing in the Georgia Dome, I might not feel a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Mississippi State will feel surely something _ pain. Al
Wilson on an adrenalin jag is a sure-fire pain in the backfield. As
it is, ``He's all over the field, making plays,'' said Mississippi
State coach Jackie Sherrill, whose Bulldogs must contend with
Wilson and the rest of Tennessee's opportunistic defense in the SEC
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al does play the game like you want it to be played,'' UT
coach Phillip Fulmer said.''You're concerned about him being a
little rusty, not having played in two weeks. But we want to have
our most valuable and intense player on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   How valuable? Although just 6-feet, 226 pounds and despite
missing three games, Wilson is second among the Vols with 73
tackles, and has four sacks and 17 of what UT calls ``big plays.''
He had 13 tackles in the opener at Syracuse and 12 in the epic win
over Florida in which Wilson caused a school-record three fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   How intense? ``Of our four captains, he's by far and away the
most emotional (and) vocal of the bunch,'' Fulmer said. The coach
said he had to talk to his linebacker ``about how to lead. You
don't always have to berate. One thing people don't know is Al is a
very devout, Christian man. You wouldn't always know that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you wouldn't. Not watching Wilson roam and terrorize the
line of scrimmage _ and occasionally, his own sideline. ``He's got
that linebacker's mentality. He's like Jack Reynolds,'' Fulmer
said, referring to ``Hacksaw'' Reynolds, who played with Fulmer at
UT before starring in the NFL. ``One of the nicest guys you'll ever
meet, but he would fight you at the drop of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's very intense,'' Tennessee defensive coordinator John
Chavis said. ``I don't know if I've ever been around anyone more
competitive. He likes to compete, to be successful. He likes his
teammates to be succcessful, too. He's a great leader, doesn't mind
getting on his teammates. If he's calling on them, he's calling on
himself, too. They know it's not (directed) against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the type of guy, I want to make every play out
there,'' Wilson said. ``If I can't, I want to be around the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   He's around it even more this season since being moved from
outside linebacker to the middle with the departures of pass
rushers Leonard Little and Jonathan Brown. Fulmer said Wilson is
just as comfortable in the middle, and far more productive.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he's had help. A veteran, deep defensive line in which
Chavis rotates his ends and tackles. A surprisingly effective
secondary. And two superb linebackers on Wilson's flanks _ Raynoch
Thompson, UT's leading tackler who sat out last week with a
sprained ankle but will play Saturday, and Eric Westmoreland, whose
vicious hit led to a fumble return for a touchdown. Chavis calls
the three linebackers ``probably the best group we've had
overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill says he thinks it's Tennessee's best overall defense,
especially up front. ``They bring people in, it doesn't make a
difference,'' he said. ``They're still good.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the man in the middle, who can't wait to get back in
the midst of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pick up where I left off,'' Wilson said. ``I don't
want to go out and try to be Superman. Just make plays.''
</P>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  UNDATED: of Houston. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol Freedenthal became familiar with Exxon when he worked at
Superior Oil, an independent Houston oil company that Mobil snapped
up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Exxon, everything was first class. They paid their people
20 percent above the industry norm,'' Freedenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   When Superior was trying to figure out the commercial potential
of shale, it put one engineer on the project. Exxon assigned five
or six groups _ about 30 people in all _ to undertake the same
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always had enough people to do what they wanted to do,''
Freedenthal said. ``They could spend money other companies never
even dreamed about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the company's readiness to do the big deal
was Jersey Standard's decision in 1919 to buy half ownership of
Houston-based Humble Oil, one of the biggest and best oil companies
to emerge from Texas. Standard later bought Humble lock, stock and
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the Humble oil field, the company was founded by men
whose names became part of the fabric of Houston. They include
Sterling, Fondren, Wiess, Blaffer, Farish and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humble had an incredibly talented group of executives,'' Pratt
said. ``One of them, William Farish, went on to run the entire
company. Humble is one of the great success stories of an acquired
company that did well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a Humble-ARCO joint venture that struck paydirt in Alaska
in 1967. The Prudhoe Bay field they discovered was the largest ever
found in North America.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Humble purchase, the domestic operating company
known as Exxon U.S.A. is now based in Houston. Exxon employs 12,824
people in the Houston area, including 4,200 workers in its Baytown
refinery. Exxon also has scads of filling stations here and often
uses Houston as a testing ground for some of its retail
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Does the successful assimilation of Humble years ago indicate
Exxon will be able or willing to share power with its new brethren
from Mobil? Pratt isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon is very confident. Exxon is very insular. It raises its
executives from within, and it is immune to new management
theories,'' Pratt said. ``It is hard to imagine Exxon will do
anything other than absorb Mobil and go on its merry way.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mobil is clearly outsized by Exxon, those who have worked
with Mobil describe it as a hard-nosed company that can hold its
own in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to buying Superior Oil in the early 1980s, Mobil became
highly annoyed with the Houston company's habit of raiding rivals
to lure away talented workers. To stop the practice, Mobil sued. To
defend itself, Superior hired Dick Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a bunch of tough guys,'' Miller said of Mobil. ``If
they are in a negotiation, they will hold their own.'' The case was
eventually dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Mobil bought Superior several years later, it was gunning
for the company's huge stockpiles _ oil and gas reserves totalling
1 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil has always been crude short. Almost everything they've
done since the beginning has had an element of that,'' Pratt said.
``Superior had a reputation as a great crude finder.''
</P>
<P>
   Within five years of the takeover, few Superior people were left
at Mobil, said Freedenthal, who accepted a severance package and
left Mobil a few years after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil knew what it wanted. It wanted those crude reserves, not
Superior's people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another noteable example of Mobil's combativeness was its war
with the press during the 1970s and 1980s. Then-president William
P. Tavoulareas sued the Washington Post and declared, ``There is
one law for the Post, and the other gods of the media, and another
law for other Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's feisty public relations man in those days, Herbert
Schmertz, also made a name for himself with his abrasive style.
Under his guidance, Mobil withdrew its advertising from newspapers
and television stations the company regarded as unfair. The company
also refused to grant interviews, opting instead to buy space in
news publications and publish its viewpoint with a series of
``editorials.'' Along with conservative commentator William Novak,
Schmertz wrote a book about his combative philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   While Mobil put up its dukes at home, it aggressively pursued
oil exploration abroad. It became the first U.S. company to drill
off the shores of Vietnam since the the end of the Vietnam War in
1975. Mobil also jumped into volatile Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil has been more of a risk-taker in the business sense,''
Freedenthal said. ``It has a street-fighter's personality.''
</P>
<P>
   While some risks have paid off, others have cratered. The worst
was its ill-fated purchase of the Montgomery Ward department store
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fiasco of the first order,'' Freedenthal said. ``They
knew nothing about how to run a consumer chain like Montgomery
Ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to evaluate the performance of Exxon and Mobil, former
Baker Hughes Vice President Ike Kerridge gives the thumbs up to
Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil is not an equal, in my opinion,'' said Kerridge, who
worked in the oil-field service business for 40 years. ``Exxon has
always had the top people. Look at their consecutive earnings
records and return on equity. It's among the best of the big U.S.
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunited, Exxon Mobil promises to be a powerful force in the oil
business. But the deal does not represent a return the age of
robber barons. Rather, it underscores how much the oil business has
changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Exxon-Mobil combination will control an
estimated 21 percent of the U.S. gasoline market. At the height of
his power, Rockefeller controlled 90 percent of the nation's
refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While America loves a winner, few men have been as hated as
Rockefeller. His ruthless business practices _ he not only forced
railroads to give him rebates on his shipments, but he also got
kickbacks for the shipments made by his rivals _ stirred national
outrage. His monopoly became popularly known as ``the Octopus.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger of this magnitude would have been utterly unthinkable
as recently as 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of putting pieces of Standard Oil back together was
taboo,'' author Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   But the oil industry is facing lean times. Crude oil prices are
in the tank, and several energy companies have recently announced
sizeable layoffs in their work forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the oil companies seem so weakened,'' Chernow said,
``they don't inspire fear the way they used to.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: MERGER IS ATTEMPT TO REDUCE COSTS, SUSTAIN PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXXON-MOBIL, EXXON-CULTURE, EXXON-ANTITRUST, EXXON-ASIA,
EXXON-DEAL, EXXON-CONSUMERS) 
(bl) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the wealth of Exxon and Mobil _ and all the market power
inherent in their announced merger _ these two oil giants are
essentially purveyors of an ordinary commodity, and commodities are
a drug on the market today, cutting into profits everywhere and
hurting national economies.
</P>
<P>
   The move is essentially an attempt by Exxon and Mobil,
particularly Mobil, to sustain profits. That helps to explain why
investors, rather than celebrate the deal, drove down the stock
prices of both companies on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are among the nation's most profitable, but
the current price of crude oil, $11.13 a barrel, is barely enough
to cover Exxon's exploration and production costs, and less than
what Mobil spends to find and retrieve oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost reductions from this huge merger will come in many
different areas,'' said Victor Burk, chief of Arthur Andersen's
Energy Services Group. ``Exxon and Mobil will combine their
headquarters and back office operations, and their purchases of
supplies and services. As the world's biggest company, their
negotiating power will be greatly enhanced. And they will try to
reduce Mobil's costs for finding and developing oil reserves,
bringing them more in line with Exxon's.''
</P>
<P>
   All that cost cutting cuts two ways for ordinary Americans.
Lower costs mean lower prices for gasoline, plastics and other
petroleum-based products. But this merger, and others in the oil
industry, represents a significant departure from more traditional
mergers, and that works against ordinary Americans, says Peter
Bernstein, an economist and consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that mergers were to gain market share,'' he
said. ``This one is to cut costs, and that involves losses to
society. Cost-cutting means people lose their jobs, and the impact
on society of downsizing is probably on balance negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost cutting through mergers is hardly a new tactic. In the oil
industry, BP Petroleum and Amoco have already taken this step, and
so have Texaco and Shell. With oil prices unlikely to rise until
Asian demand revives _ probably many months in the future _ other
oil companies appear to be moving in the same direction. France's
Total SA announced Tuesday that it had acquired a 41 percent stake
in Belgium's Petrofina SA.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in commodity prices goes beyond oil, and also beyond
steel or textiles or livestock or grain or all the other basic
materials that the word ``commodity'' brings to mind. Because of
the collapse in Asian demand, an index of 28 of these commodities
has fallen by 25 percent since last spring, a record drop. But in
today's modern global economy, ``commodity'' also takes in numerous
manufactured goods that are easily produced anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airliners are not commodities. Two companies, Boeing
and Airbus, control the key technologies and production skills.
Highly technical medical devices are also exempt, their production
limited to those companies and workers with the necessary know-how.
But razors are a commodity, the very best easily copied and
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are another example, and so are apparel, lathes, computer
chips, small appliances, toys, kitchenware, television sets,
watches and many other electronic devices. Commodities in this
broader sense are in over-supply mainly because so many companies
stepped up production in recent years, in the expectation that as
supply rose, so would demand, absorbing the new supply.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis destroyed that strategy, and now manufacturers
find themselves unable to sell all that they can produce, and often
forced to cut prices, hurting profits and forcing layoffs in the
United States and abroad as production has been cut back. ``The
basic phenomenon, however you to define the word commodities, is
that there is a huge amount of slack capacity in most industries,''
said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil are caught in this squeeze. No U.S. corporation
was more profitable than Exxon last year, and Mobil was also among
the top performers. The two giants are still reporting healthy
profits. Their refining operations and gasoline marketing, for
example, continue to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, says Burk, an Exxon-Mobil merger will give the new
company much more clout in dealings with OPEC. ``In terms of
production,'' he said, ``it will be near in size to several of the
big state-owned oil companies in the Middle East. It will have the
means to finance very large exploration and development projects.
And we may see Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, for example, opening their
countries to foreign oil investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now, in the basic business of exploring for oil,
drilling the wells and recovering crude oil and natural gas,
Exxon's and Mobil's costs are beginning to reach or surpass the
basic price they get for even the best quality crude, known as West
Texas Intermediate Crude. Its price of $11.13 Tuesday is down 41
percent from $18.83 last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, the stronger of the two companies, pumped from its U.S.
fields 204 barrels out of a total worldwide production of 584
barrels last year. The exploration and production cost averaged
$7.11 a barrel, according to Arthur Andersen's Energy Services
Group, which surveys oil industry costs, based on public
disclosures. Outside the United States, the Exxon exploration and
recovery cost was $10.39 a barrel _ a healthy margin last year,
when crude oil rose above $20 a barrel for a while, but
uncomfortably close to today's much lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 250 million barrels of crude oil that Mobil pumped
everywhere in the world last year, 89 million came from U.S.
fields, at a cost of $14.85 a barrel in the United States for
exploration and recovery, and $11.52 abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil is not in good shape today in this category,'' Burk
said, `` and when you consider all the other costs involved in
recovering crude oil, the cost for both companies is probably more
than the current world oil price.''

IN AN UNREAL CITY, REAL MASTERWORKS BEAT THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ This being Las Vegas, the art gallery at Steve
Wynn's new Bellagio Hotel was still open the other night at 11
o'clock, so I wandered in. Every day, I'm told, 1,800 people, which
is the maximum number allowed, pay $10 to see what's in the
gallery's two small rooms (dark walls, spotlights on the pictures).
Half of the visitors buy the $4 audio guides narrated by Wynn.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds had thinned at night, which made it easier to see the
Brancusi and Giacometti sculptures and a big Franz Kline painting
called ``August Day.'' I mention those three works, among the
couple of dozen things on view, because the next morning, when I
returned to take another look, poof! They were gone. They'd been
sold and shipped out in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, this is Vegas. What do you expect? Novelty rules. You may
recall the Bellagio's advertising blitz, with its pictures of
lovers on balconies and spurting fountains. Of course, much of the
hoopla about the hotel was generated not by advertisers but by art
writers who, in praising the art that Wynn had bought, helped to
sell the idea of the place as a quasi-museum.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, we were led to understand, was no longer a city of
simulated histories, stuck forever in the ephemeral present. Now it
had real paintings and sculptures, which linked it to cultures
older and bigger than itself.
</P>
<P>
   Except, as it has turned out, it didn't necessarily have these
particular paintings and sculptures, because like everything else
in gambling's unofficial capital, the art was for sale: Wynn
legally became an art dealer to get a tax break on the collection,
a situation that requires him to keep the art in the gallery on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   I thumbed through the collection catalogue, a remarkably good
document put together by his curator, Libby Lumpkin, with essays by
writers like Dave Hickey and Peter Schjeldahl and Richard Schiff. I
calculated that half a dozen of the works in the catalogue had
already been sold: besides the works by Brancusi, Giacometti and
Kline, a Johns, an Oldenburg and a Lichtenstein are gone. A couple
of Warhols are poised to go; they've been removed from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   If I sound critical, I am not. What Wynn is doing doesn't bother
me. There's something refreshing about the fact that his money is,
so to speak, on the table. If Wynn treats great works of art a
little like poker chips, if what he enjoys is the art of the deal,
he's no different from many other collectors, just more public
about his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Give him credit. He has found a way to sell his hotel by
promoting his art and to sell his art by promoting his hotel, the
buzz about one helping to stimulate the buzz about the other.
</P>
<P>
   Even the money the gallery rakes in from tickets and audio
guides (around $25,000 a day) seems to me proof of Wynn's marketing
savvy, not because the money helps the hotel's bottom line (it goes
to charity, Wynn says) but because in Las Vegas charging admission
makes more people want to look at the art.
</P>
<P>
   Where everything is measured in money, nothing worthwhile is
free. Hence, the gallery's appeal is paradoxically enhanced by its
fee. (Note to Manhattan dealers: don't try this at home.)
</P>
<P>
   I mention all this because I had the sense, in looking at Wynn's
collection and in watching other people look at it, that something
rather curious was taking place. It has to do with wonderment. The
art here has acquired a life that seems to match its new,
unorthodox environment.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas exists for the pursuit of pleasure. People who've
never looked at art before (one woman in the gallery asked me who
Renoir was) are discovering a new pleasure in Cezanne, which can't
be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   After I stopped into the gallery at night, I went to see the
hotel's other big attraction, the Cirque du Soleil's ``O,'' as in
``eau.'' It's like most Cirque du Soleil shows _ the same
acrobatics, basically _ except that much of it takes place in a
vast pool of water, which miraculously comes and goes onstage.
</P>
<P>
   I mention it because ``O'' is not unlike the hotel's art gallery
in that its gimmick involves something foreign to Las Vegas. Las
Vegas is a desert, and just as you don't expect to find great art
here, you don't imagine that a lake can be conjured up, then
suddenly made to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happens as a result of this cognitive dissonance:
neither the art nor the water seems altogether real at first. They
are initially absorbed into the simulationist culture of Las Vegas
_ they seem unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey, the art critic, who lives here, jokingly describes the
situation as ``post-hyper-real real.'' Spectacle being the ultimate
form of reality here, real art becomes a kind of phenomenon akin,
say, to the world's biggest gold nugget at Wynn's Gold Nugget
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity as a thing in itself becomes an attraction.
Visitors to the Bellagio are enticed by the idea of their proximity
to a genuine Monet. I heard a man in the gallery ask whether the
art was real. In one of the hotel's restaurants, which has a number
of Picassos on its walls, diners ask the staff the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the aura of the true object is enhanced by contrast with
its opposite. This is one of the odd lessons here. Another lesson:
good art is astonishingly elastic. It survives almost anything and
adapts to whatever circumstances you put it in, opening itself up
to new meanings and allegories.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey mentioned to me the way a Modigliani portrait in the
collection looked when, at one point, it was hung over a baccarat
table in the hotel's casino. The picture's suave, Mediterranean
sensibility suddenly became apparent in a way that would not
necessarily occur in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Not all paintings are at home in museums, after all. Most of
them weren't painted with museums in mind. Museums are neutral and
neutralizing spaces, which is why it's a lot more memorable to come
upon a good 1970s de Kooning behind the registration desk of a Las
Vegas hotel than in the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the Pop pictures sold by Wynn (who is himself a kind of
pop figure and therefore perhaps too close to pop to see fully its
merits) have been replaced by a Rembrandt and an excellent Rubens,
both on approval, meaning he is thinking about buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken the measure of his audience and the art market,
he's clearly reconsidering the slant of the collection, selling off
post-1950s art to orient what's on view more to the tastes of the
novice public that the hotel attracts. To Wynn's credit, he doesn't
seem to want to compromise the quality of what's on view in the
process. At least not so far.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Las Vegas is the most democratic of cities
because slot machines don't care what race you are or where you
went to school: everyone faces the same odds. In a way, Wynn seems
to regard his gallery of multimillion-dollar paintings as a
populist enterprise. I'd add that it's also a symbol not of a new,
culturally mature Las Vegas but of the old, wild, unpretentious Las
Vegas, where everything is fantastical and nothing stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn says that only a great deal of money would cause him to
part with his favorite works in the collection (a Van Gogh, a
Cezanne, a few Picassos), a statement meant to signal that his art
is not entirely up for grabs. We'll see. I suppose this is about as
much of a guarantee of stability as you can expect around here.

 &HT;    NBA talks resuming to clean slate on issues
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two weeks of finger-pointing, the NBA and the
NBA Players Association are going back into full session Thursday
with an open docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is back on the table,'' NBA spokesman Brian
McIntyre said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The union said Monday it would have no contact with the league
until commissioner David Stern phoned union chief Billy Hunter, but
McIntyre said he did not know which side initiated conversations
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're meeting is enough,'' McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will back away from decisions that became
contentious after a marathon negotiating session Nov. 20.
Apparently there were misunderstandings over issues that involve
the timing of free-agent signings and escrow proposals. So positive
was the session that Hawks center and executive committee member
Dikembe Mutombo cheerfully said he expected to be playing after New
Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were dashed when the league canceled last Saturday's
bargaining session, and the league's chief legal officer, Jeffrey
Mishkin, pointed to an inflexible stance by the union. Hunter made
similar remarks about the league.
</P>
<P>
   The principal issue that stands between the parties, and hinders
an agreement, is the percentage of income that will go to the
players. The union is at 57 percent, the league reportedly at 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is sharp disagreement on how an escrow system
would work and on the league's refusal to grant a salary-cap
exemption for teams that exceed it to sign outside free agents so
they can re-sign their own.

 &HT;    College coaching carousel: Out with the old, in with the new
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Oklahoma and Clemson could be the big winners, while
Florida, Tennessee and Tulane stand to be losers in college
football's coaching carousel, which hit full swing this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the regular season doesn't end until after this
weekend's slate of six games, nearly a dozen schools already will
have new coaches next year. Five of those programs _ Auburn,
Clemson, Duke, Mississippi and South Carolina _ are in the ACC or
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the game,'' ESPN college football analyst
Lee Corso said. ``It happens in corporate America all the time. If
you don't produce the expectations imposed upon you by the higher
authorities, they're going to make a change. It's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss, which lost fourth-year coach Tommy Tuberville to
Auburn on Nov. 28, is expected to name Tennessee offensive
coordinator David Cutcliffe as its coach today during an 11 a.m.
news conference. Cutcliffe, 44, interviewed with Rebels athletics
director John Shafer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe, who will coach in Saturday's SEC championship game
against No. 23 Mississippi State in the Georgia Dome, refused to
comment Tuesday whether he would remain on the UT staff for the
team's bowl game. Cutcliffe, an assistant coach at Tennessee since
1983, was promoted to offensive coordinator when Phillip Fulmer was
named the Vols' head coach in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In that capacity, Cutcliffe tutored quarterbacksAndy Kelly,
Heath Shuler and All-American Peyton Manning, as well as current
starter Tee Martin. Vols running backs coach Randy Sanders could be
promoted to coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which fired John Blake on Nov. 22 after three losing
seasons in a row, landed Florida defensive coordinator Bob Stoops
as its coach on Tuesday. Stoops, 38, helped rebuild the Kansas
State program as defensive coordinator, then put bite in the
Florida defense, which ranked in the top 15 nationally each of his
three seasons in Gainesville. Stoops, given a five-year contract
worth $700,000 annually, will begin his duties immediately; he also
had been a candidate to replace Hayden Fry at Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not shy away from the expectations here at Oklahoma,''
Stoops said. ``In fact, I will embrace them. I know we'll operate
with no excuses. ... Oklahoma was a very easy decision. I've been
talking about this job with so many coaches for many years, that
I've thought this was always a very special job.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clemson and South Carolina both could be close to
ending their searches. Tulane coach Tommy Bowden toured the Clemson
campus on Monday and could make an announcement about his future
today, according to Tulane assistant athletics director Scott
Stricklin.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who guided the Green Wave to an improbable 11-0 record
this season and a berth in the Liberty Bowl, is the top candidate
to replace Tommy West, fired after a 3-8 year. Bowden is mulling an
$800,000 offer from Clemson, which reportedly was matched by
Tulane. Bowden's current contract with the Green Wave has a
$750,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia (S.C.) State reported Tuesday that South Carolina
has offered former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz $1 million a year to
take over its struggling program. The newspaper said that Holtz met
with Carolina athletics director Mike McGee on Sunday night. Holtz,
61, retired after the 1996 season, in which he led the Fighting
Irish to an 8-3 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, who met with both Clemson and
South Carolina, withdrew his name Tuesday after receiving a new
contract from the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Florida could be affected by other coaching changes. Gators
assistant offensive coordinator/running backs coach Carl Franks
appears to be the top candidate at Duke, where Fred Goldsmith was
fired Monday after four losing seasons in a row. Franks, an
assistant at Florida since 1990, played running back and tight end
for the Blue Devils, 1979-82.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut coach Skip Holtz and Marshall coach Bob Pruett also
have been mentioned as candidates at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia offensive line coach Chris Scelfo, who already has
interviewed for the vacancy at Southwest Louisiana, could be a top
choice at Northeast Louisiana, where he played center, 1981-84, and
served two years as an assistant coach. The Indians fired coach Ed
Zaunbrecher on Monday after he failed to earn a winning record in
five seasons.

 &HT;    J.J. a limited factor in Miss. State title run
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKVILLE, Miss. _ Being ``on the run'' with James Johnson
isn't only a nifty slogan that describes his offensive exploits
this season for Mississippi State; lately, it's the only way to
catch up with him off the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the talented senior tailback doesn't suit up for
practice, as was the case on Tuesday, the SEC's leading rusher
keeps a frenetic pace in street clothes and sneakers. He moves
between athletics department offices and football practice
facilities like a man late for a team meeting, which he is, pausing
just long enough to explain how his teammates won their last two
regular-season games _ clinching the SEC West title _ largely
without him.
</P>
<P>
   And how, despite being underdogs against top-ranked Tennessee in
Saturday's SEC championship game, they can confound the naysayers
who don't think they stand much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see my team win without me was a great feeling,'' he said.
``They've done it before, so why can't they do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose playing status is questionable because of groin
and shoulder injuries, has been forced to slow himself down the
last two weeks, although they have been the biggest for Mississippi
State football in years. He was as animated as anyone in maroon on
Thanksgiving night after the Bulldogs capped their SEC West title
with a victory over Mississippi, a game in which he played little
but scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm day-to-day right now, but I can't let myself get
frustrated about it,'' Johnson said. ``I've had to learn how to
pick myself up. I'm not going to hold my head down about it. We've
got some guys on this team who are able to get a lot of things done
without me, and I'm going to be pulling for them whether or not I
play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to push himself was too great over the weekend.
Against the wishes of his coaches and trainers, Johnson did some
independent running Saturday and Sunday just to stay loose and
discovered that a bruise had developed near the pulled groin
muscle. An MRI test Monday was negative, but he might be held out
of practice again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset that he did that, but that's J.J.,'' head coach
Jackie Sherrill said. ``He really's been fighting to play.
Sometimes, he fights the trainers to get out there. The groin looks
like it's healing, but how much he'll be able to play is still a
question right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has become MSU's single-season rushing leader with
1,369 yards, and had a single-game high of 237 against Alabama that
propeled the Bulldogs' late-season charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the top echelon of running backs in the country,''
Sherrill said. ``When he steps out there, he produces. We've got
backs who are capable, but they're not J.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 24, fits the MSU profile of a late-budding star. After
graduating from high school in Mobile, where he played street
football with Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin, he spent a year in
the Navy, then moved on to East Mississippi Junior College, just a
short drive from the MSU campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was meant to play football,'' he said. ``I got a lot
out of being in the Navy, but I wanted to get on with my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In just two seasons with the Bulldogs, the 6-foot-2, 232-pounder
has jumped into fourth place among career rushing leaders and
figures to draw plenty of interest from NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   How he finishes his college career is paramount, for the moment,
and his teammates play down Johnson's assertions that they don't
need more from him than what they've gotten the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wasn't out there, we learned how to do some other
things and won some big games that way,'' quarterback Wayne Madkin
said. ``But we're still going to need him bad out there on
Saturday. There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows that whether or not he can go is out of his
control: ``I'm just going to hope and pray for the best.''

 &HT;    Booker's improvement bolsters pass defense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons occasionally ``hide'' Michael
Booker with the help of a safety, but there's no hiding that he has
improved and that Atlanta's pass defense has done the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, the Falcons' defense has improved its
ranking from No. 23 to No. 17 to No. 9, allowing 301.3 yards a
game. Stronger pass defense is the biggest reason.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's last two opponents, Chicago and St. Louis, were poor
teams with struggling quarterbacks. But when a defense gives up 129
and 104 passing yards, respectively, as the Falcons (10-2) did,
plenty is going right.
</P>
<P>
   Before those two games, Atlanta's pass defense ranked last in
the NFL, giving up an average of about 250 yards, including 307
yards to the 49ers. The unit is ranked No. 25 now, allowing 225.4
yards per game, while the front seven is No. 2 against the run.
``We're covering better,'' said defensive coordinator Rich Brooks,
whose unit allowed net passing totals of 205 and 207 yards in wins
against St. Louis and New England before the 49ers game.
``(Cornerback) Ray (Buchanan) is playing very well, and Booker is
really improved. And (cornerbacks Ronnie) Bradford and (Randy)
Fuller have been very good in the nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker, a second-year cornerback from Nebraska, was a
disappointment last year as a first-round draft choice. He had a
difficult time defending deep routes and keeping his balance when
he tried to play physically. When Bradford injured a knee on Oct.
25, Booker, a 6-foot-2, 203-pounder, moved into the lineup. In five
consecutive starts, all wins, he is playing more the way that the
Falcons expected when they signed him to a five-year, $8.2 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who usually covers the opposing team's best receiver,
is playing at a Pro Bowl level. He is tied for the NFC lead with
five interceptions and has defensed a team-high 18 passes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Brooks has trusted Booker more, and the
resulting increase in man-to-man and bump-and-run coverage is
working. Booker, who is second on the team with eight passes
defensed, hasn't been beaten deep yet, although free safety Eugene
Robinson or nickel safety Devin Bush often roll behind Booker.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta beat San Francisco 31-19, Booker held 6-2,
218-pound 49ers receiver J.J. Stokes to one catch for 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Michael playing better, we believe we can match up with
anyone,'' Buchanan said. ``He's running with receivers a lot
better. He's getting his hands on receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has said that Bradford (5-10, 188) will start
again when he is healthy. But given the team's investment in Booker
and the way he's playing, there's no rush.
</P>
<P>
   More bump-and-run coverage means more blitzing, which helps
explain the Falcons' 14 sacks the past four games.

 &HT;    Moss wasn't for the Birds
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last the NFL apportioned flesh, 19 teams chose to
pass on Randy Moss instead of pass to him. As of today, that stands
as the kind of mass blunder that gives lemmings and witch hunts a
bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Akin to 19 record companies auditioning the Beatles and telling
them, ``Cut your hair, get Ringo more involved, then we'll talk.''
Or to 19 editors informing John Grisham, ``Nobody wants to read
about lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the NBA, now officially the world's daftest league, got
around to drafting Michael Jordan by the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   Every catch Moss makes, every defensive back he turns into
statuary, every time he laps the ordinary, he also tightens the
collars of front-office soldiers from Seattle to Foxboro. He stands
to become a once-in-a-generation type of player, the latest in the
line, a Jerry Rice-squared. And leave in his wake more
second-guessing and regret than a week's worth of Las Vegas
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, against Dallas _ the team that was most likely to
draft Moss before he fell to Minnesota _ he exacted his latest
measure of revenge. Just three catches, that's all. But each a
touchdown, each 51 yards or more. It was a good, old-fashioned
holiday vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Moss figures to get around to everybody sooner of later. He is
payback's personal chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, during a season otherwise free of vexing questions,
there is this: Would you rather have Randy Moss or Keith Brooking?
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to see the damage done by Moss and not picture
him working instead in the Falcons' dome. Can't help but think of
the artistic flourishes he could add to the Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone is obsessing on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had it to do over again, we'd do exactly the same
thing,'' said the father of all things Falcon, Dan Reeves. What,
you were expecting him to break down and beg for a draft-day
mulligan?
</P>
<P>
   Regret, which once clung to the Falcons like a birthmark,
refuses to stick now.
</P>
<P>
   No, Moss never was as much as a tickle in the back of Reeves'
throat when their first pick arrived. ``With what we're trying to
do (in building from the foundation), we couldn't afford to take
the risk,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Moss' character questions, heightened by the way he avoided
pre-draft exposure, made him a considerable risk. Much of the
damage was self-inflicted. And Minnesota might just be a unique
situation where Moss can flourish (although I'd take Terance Mathis
as a mentor anytime). All that tends to get drowned out in the
noise he now produces.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went for a linebacker who is slowly becoming more
and more visible in limited playing time. While the player drafted
nine spots below him is the sensation of the season. This was a
vote for the certificate of deposit over the new-issue stock.

   Reeves still isn't ready to get speculative. ``(Moss) is doing a
tremendous job. He's been a great asset. The future is still one of
the things that concerns you. Anybody can deal with success. When
the going gets tough, will it all hold up?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of franchises are looking at the huge one that got away _
Tennessee drafted another wide receiver instead, Cincinnati picked
over Moss twice. Reasons and rationalizations abound, many of them
sound. But I can't help myself. I am incapable of looking on this
player and not uttering, ``What if?''

 &HT;    Fresno, 'Cats Delta foes for Dogs, Jackets
 &HT;    By Norman Arey

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's Ron Jirsa and Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins
got together Tuesday morning to promote the 1998 Delta Air Lines
Classic For Kids. The Bulldogs will open the tournament at 5 p.m.
Dec. 19 against Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State team, and then the
Yellow Jackets will take on defending national champion Kentucky at
7:30 in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The one-day event, which benefits the Scottish Rite Children's
Medical Center and Camp Twin Lakes, is expected to draw more than
20,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia, it will be a rematch with the Bulldogs from Fresno
State, whom they beat 95-79 in the third-place game of the NIT in
March. Georgia Tech lost to Kentucky 85-71 in Lexington, Ky., last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresno State is a great opponent with a legendary coach and
very athletic players,'' Jirsa said. ``But don't keep bringing up
that we beat them last year. Our team is playing pretty well right
now. Although we've got five seniors, we've got a sophomore center
(Robb Dryden) who hasn't had a great deal of experience, and our
top scorer (Jumaine Jones) is a sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins has been the driving force in bringing major programs to
play in the Atlanta event over the years and keeping the tournament
going when it went through sponsorship changes. ``If Bobby Cremins
hadn't been here, I can tell you that there would be no
tournament,'' said Shelton Stevens of the Scottish Rite Hospital.
``He has taken it on his shoulders and carried it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our in-state players to stay home,'' Cremins said.
``We want to bring big-time basketball to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins, whose team is 4-1, said he was pleased with its showing
in the Big Island Tournanent, where the Jackets beat New Orleans
and West Virginia before losing to No. 16 Washington in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of circling the wagons,'' he said. ``We've got one
more game left until we get (7-foot-1 Indiana transfer) Jason
Collier eligible. Then we've got help coming.''

 &HT;    NBA talks resuming to clean slate on issues
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two weeks of finger-pointing, the NBA and the
NBA Players Association are going back into full session Thursday
with an open docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is back on the table,'' NBA spokesman Brian
McIntyre said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The union said Monday it would have no contact with the league
until commissioner David Stern phoned union chief Billy Hunter, but
McIntyre said he did not know which side initiated conversations
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're meeting is enough,'' McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will back away from decisions that became
contentious after a marathon negotiating session Nov. 20.
Apparently there were misunderstandings over issues that involve
the timing of free-agent signings and escrow proposals. So positive
was the session that Hawks center and executive committee member
Dikembe Mutombo cheerfully said he expected to be playing after New
Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were dashed when the league canceled last Saturday's
bargaining session, and the league's chief legal officer, Jeffrey
Mishkin, pointed to an inflexible stance by the union. Hunter made
similar remarks about the league.
</P>
<P>
   The principal issue that stands between the parties, and hinders
an agreement, is the percentage of income that will go to the
players. The union is at 57 percent, the league reportedly at 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is sharp disagreement on how an escrow system
would work and on the league's refusal to grant a salary-cap
exemption for teams that exceed it to sign outside free agents so
they can re-sign their own.

ADVERTISING: A SUCCESS STORY IN WEB SITE ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Link Exchange, a two-year-old Internet company that built a
large membership by luring Web sites with the offer of free
advertising, and then sold advertising to outside companies and
products to its members, has clearly reaped its reward.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, Microsoft Corp. bought the company with plans
to fold it into the Microsoft Network, the software giant's portal,
or gateway page, on the World Wide Web. The terms of the deal were
not disclosed, but news reports put the value at $250 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Link Exchange, which is based in San Francisco, was started in
March 1996. Its advertising network membership consists of people
with home pages and small businesses with Web sites, all drawn by a
barter system for advertising on the Web sites of other members.
Link Exchange also offers free help with starting a Web site and
designing a banner ad, a free mailing list program for
direct-marketing campaigns and regular reports on when and how
often users visit the members' sites.
</P>
<P>
   For every two banner ads a member places on its site, one of its
ads appears elsewhere on the network. Advertising brings Link
Exchange Web sites what all sites want: more traffic. For
businesses, traffic can mean customers.
</P>
<P>
   The network's growth has been impressive: at the end of 1997,
there were 200,000 members, compared with 75,000 at the end of
1996. Today, Link Exchange's advertising network has more than
400,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Koslowski, who owns an employment agency in Coconut Creek,
Fla., that specializes in the computer and technical fields, has
been a member of Link Exchange since it began. ``I filtered out the
ads of other employment agencies when I set up my banner
exchanges,'' he said, and used the traffic reports as a monitor of
visits to his pages. ``The information allowed me to modify my site
to direct people to my job-posting page,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The banners traded among members do not generate revenue for
Link Exchange. But in the company's two-for-one exchange policy,
there is a leftover banner, and Link Exchange sells those to
outside companies, including American Express and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Link Exchange's large membership has given it a ready pool of
customers for the other half of its revenue-generating business:
offering Internet products to members. These include a service that
submits a company's Internet address to search engines, an
affiliate program in which members can earn a commission based on
the sales of retailers linked to their site and the opportunity to
join other Link Exchange members in buying adspace at bulk rates on
large Internet networks such as Gamespot, Theglobe.com and
Babycenter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has also been part of this advertising package, but that
will probably change, because it competes with the Microsoft
Network as a portal.
</P>
<P>
   Link Exchange, which was privately held, did not release revenue
or sales figures. Chief executive Mark Bozzini said half of the
company's revenue came from advertising and the other half from
sales of Internet products. Some of these products duplicate
similar Microsoft offerings and may go the way of the Yahoo
advertising deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nail, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, which sells
reports on Internet marketing trends and technology, said Link
Exchange had been successful in selling advertising to outside
companies. ``With the Microsoft Network, there will be added
credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft did not buy the company primarily for its
advertising network, Nail added. The Link Exchange acquisition gave
Microsoft a channel for selling its software and products to the
company's hundreds of thousands of members, he said, adding that
Microsoft sites like Travelocity and Sidewalk offer Link Exchange
members a ready-made model for small businesses that are trying to
reach a local audience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   How much of Link Exchange's income will continue to come from
outside advertising is unclear, though the network offers
advertisers an impressive reach and the ability to place banners
among similar sites. According to Doug McFarland, the general
manager of Media Metrix, an Internet statistics tracking company,
Link Exchange reaches about ``a third of all Internet users in a
typical month.'' But, he added, so do other networks like
Doubleclick and 24/7 Media.
</P>
<P>
   Some larger advertisers, like Procter &AMP; Gamble and American
Airlines, tried Link Exchange but have discontinued buying banners.
</P>
<P>
   Animalhouse.com, a site for college students, also bought
advertising on the network. ``Link Exchange had a wide reach for a
reasonable price,'' said Jay Samit, the president of Animalhouse,
which is controlled by the Universal Studios unit of Seagram Co.
and Hyundai Group. However, his company, which started on the
Internet on Sept. 15, will probably not stay with Link Exchange in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our launch, it was a way to get to the word out about our
site,'' Samit said. ``But as we emerge as a stronger brand, we'll
be trying to pull people onto the Web through our site, as opposed
to hijacking traffic through other sites.''

 &HT;    College coaching carousel: Out with the old, in with the new
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Oklahoma and Clemson could be the big winners, while
Florida, Tennessee and Tulane stand to be losers in college
football's coaching carousel, which hit full swing this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the regular season doesn't end until after this
weekend's slate of six games, nearly a dozen schools already will
have new coaches next year. Five of those programs _ Auburn,
Clemson, Duke, Mississippi and South Carolina _ are in the ACC or
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the game,'' ESPN college football analyst
Lee Corso said. ``It happens in corporate America all the time. If
you don't produce the expectations imposed upon you by the higher
authorities, they're going to make a change. It's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss, which lost fourth-year coach Tommy Tuberville to
Auburn on Nov. 28, is expected to name Tennessee offensive
coordinator David Cutcliffe as its coach today during an 11 a.m.
news conference. Cutcliffe, 44, interviewed with Rebels athletics
director John Shafer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe, who will coach in Saturday's SEC championship game
against No. 23 Mississippi State in the Georgia Dome, refused to
comment Tuesday whether he would remain on the UT staff for the
team's bowl game. Cutcliffe, an assistant coach at Tennessee since
1983, was promoted to offensive coordinator when Phillip Fulmer was
named the Vols' head coach in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In that capacity, Cutcliffe tutored quarterbacksAndy Kelly,
Heath Shuler and All-American Peyton Manning, as well as current
starter Tee Martin. Vols running backs coach Randy Sanders could be
promoted to coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which fired John Blake on Nov. 22 after three losing
seasons in a row, landed Florida defensive coordinator Bob Stoops
as its coach on Tuesday. Stoops, 38, helped rebuild the Kansas
State program as defensive coordinator, then put bite in the
Florida defense, which ranked in the top 15 nationally each of his
three seasons in Gainesville. Stoops, given a five-year contract
worth $700,000 annually, will begin his duties immediately; he also
had been a candidate to replace Hayden Fry at Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not shy away from the expectations here at Oklahoma,''
Stoops said. ``In fact, I will embrace them. I know we'll operate
with no excuses. ... Oklahoma was a very easy decision. I've been
talking about this job with so many coaches for many years, that
I've thought this was always a very special job.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clemson and South Carolina both could be close to
ending their searches. Tulane coach Tommy Bowden toured the Clemson
campus on Monday and could make an announcement about his future
today, according to Tulane assistant athletics director Scott
Stricklin.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who guided the Green Wave to an improbable 11-0 record
this season and a berth in the Liberty Bowl, is the top candidate
to replace Tommy West, fired after a 3-8 year. Bowden is mulling an
$800,000 offer from Clemson, which reportedly was matched by
Tulane. Bowden's current contract with the Green Wave has a
$750,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia (S.C.) State reported Tuesday that South Carolina
has offered former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz $1 million a year to
take over its struggling program. The newspaper said that Holtz met
with Carolina athletics director Mike McGee on Sunday night. Holtz,
61, retired after the 1996 season, in which he led the Fighting
Irish to an 8-3 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, who met with both Clemson and
South Carolina, withdrew his name Tuesday after receiving a new
contract from the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Florida could be affected by other coaching changes. Gators
assistant offensive coordinator/running backs coach Carl Franks
appears to be the top candidate at Duke, where Fred Goldsmith was
fired Monday after four losing seasons in a row. Franks, an
assistant at Florida since 1990, played running back and tight end
for the Blue Devils, 1979-82.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut coach Skip Holtz and Marshall coach Bob Pruett also
have been mentioned as candidates at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia offensive line coach Chris Scelfo, who already has
interviewed for the vacancy at Southwest Louisiana, could be a top
choice at Northeast Louisiana, where he played center, 1981-84, and
served two years as an assistant coach. The Indians fired coach Ed
Zaunbrecher on Monday after he failed to earn a winning record in
five seasons.

 &HT;    J.J. a limited factor in Miss. State title run
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKVILLE, Miss. _ Being ``on the run'' with James Johnson
isn't only a nifty slogan that describes his offensive exploits
this season for Mississippi State; lately, it's the only way to
catch up with him off the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the talented senior tailback doesn't suit up for
practice, as was the case on Tuesday, the SEC's leading rusher
keeps a frenetic pace in street clothes and sneakers. He moves
between athletics department offices and football practice
facilities like a man late for a team meeting, which he is, pausing
just long enough to explain how his teammates won their last two
regular-season games _ clinching the SEC West title _ largely
without him.
</P>
<P>
   And how, despite being underdogs against top-ranked Tennessee in
Saturday's SEC championship game, they can confound the naysayers
who don't think they stand much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see my team win without me was a great feeling,'' he said.
``They've done it before, so why can't they do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose playing status is questionable because of groin
and shoulder injuries, has been forced to slow himself down the
last two weeks, although they have been the biggest for Mississippi
State football in years. He was as animated as anyone in maroon on
Thanksgiving night after the Bulldogs capped their SEC West title
with a victory over Mississippi, a game in which he played little
but scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm day-to-day right now, but I can't let myself get
frustrated about it,'' Johnson said. ``I've had to learn how to
pick myself up. I'm not going to hold my head down about it. We've
got some guys on this team who are able to get a lot of things done
without me, and I'm going to be pulling for them whether or not I
play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to push himself was too great over the weekend.
Against the wishes of his coaches and trainers, Johnson did some
independent running Saturday and Sunday just to stay loose and
discovered that a bruise had developed near the pulled groin
muscle. An MRI test Monday was negative, but he might be held out
of practice again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset that he did that, but that's J.J.,'' head coach
Jackie Sherrill said. ``He really's been fighting to play.
Sometimes, he fights the trainers to get out there. The groin looks
like it's healing, but how much he'll be able to play is still a
question right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has become MSU's single-season rushing leader with
1,369 yards, and had a single-game high of 237 against Alabama that
propeled the Bulldogs' late-season charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the top echelon of running backs in the country,''
Sherrill said. ``When he steps out there, he produces. We've got
backs who are capable, but they're not J.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 24, fits the MSU profile of a late-budding star. After
graduating from high school in Mobile, where he played street
football with Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin, he spent a year in
the Navy, then moved on to East Mississippi Junior College, just a
short drive from the MSU campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was meant to play football,'' he said. ``I got a lot
out of being in the Navy, but I wanted to get on with my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In just two seasons with the Bulldogs, the 6-foot-2, 232-pounder
has jumped into fourth place among career rushing leaders and
figures to draw plenty of interest from NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   How he finishes his college career is paramount, for the moment,
and his teammates play down Johnson's assertions that they don't
need more from him than what they've gotten the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wasn't out there, we learned how to do some other
things and won some big games that way,'' quarterback Wayne Madkin
said. ``But we're still going to need him bad out there on
Saturday. There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows that whether or not he can go is out of his
control: ``I'm just going to hope and pray for the best.''

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ On the field or in your face, Al Wilson is as
straightforward as his name. Yes, he's feeling much better. After
missing most of the Kentucky game and sitting out Saturday at
Vanderbilt, Wilson's pulled groin has healed nicely. So this
Saturday night, he'll be comfortably back on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not 100 percent,'' said Wilson, the senior middle
linebacker and soul of top-ranked Tennessee. ``But who knows? When
my adrenalin gets flowing in the Georgia Dome, I might not feel a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Mississippi State will feel surely something _ pain. Al
Wilson on an adrenalin jag is a sure-fire pain in the backfield. As
it is, ``He's all over the field, making plays,'' said Mississippi
State coach Jackie Sherrill, whose Bulldogs must contend with
Wilson and the rest of Tennessee's opportunistic defense in the SEC
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al does play the game like you want it to be played,'' UT
coach Phillip Fulmer said.''You're concerned about him being a
little rusty, not having played in two weeks. But we want to have
our most valuable and intense player on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   How valuable? Although just 6-feet, 226 pounds and despite
missing three games, Wilson is second among the Vols with 73
tackles, and has four sacks and 17 of what UT calls ``big plays.''
He had 13 tackles in the opener at Syracuse and 12 in the epic win
over Florida in which Wilson caused a school-record three fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   How intense? ``Of our four captains, he's by far and away the
most emotional (and) vocal of the bunch,'' Fulmer said. The coach
said he had to talk to his linebacker ``about how to lead. You
don't always have to berate. One thing people don't know is Al is a
very devout, Christian man. You wouldn't always know that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you wouldn't. Not watching Wilson roam and terrorize the
line of scrimmage _ and occasionally, his own sideline. ``He's got
that linebacker's mentality. He's like Jack Reynolds,'' Fulmer
said, referring to ``Hacksaw'' Reynolds, who played with Fulmer at
UT before starring in the NFL. ``One of the nicest guys you'll ever
meet, but he would fight you at the drop of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's very intense,'' Tennessee defensive coordinator John
Chavis said. ``I don't know if I've ever been around anyone more
competitive. He likes to compete, to be successful. He likes his
teammates to be succcessful, too. He's a great leader, doesn't mind
getting on his teammates. If he's calling on them, he's calling on
himself, too. They know it's not (directed) against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the type of guy, I want to make every play out
there,'' Wilson said. ``If I can't, I want to be around the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   He's around it even more this season since being moved from
outside linebacker to the middle with the departures of pass
rushers Leonard Little and Jonathan Brown. Fulmer said Wilson is
just as comfortable in the middle, and far more productive.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he's had help. A veteran, deep defensive line in which
Chavis rotates his ends and tackles. A surprisingly effective
secondary. And two superb linebackers on Wilson's flanks _ Raynoch
Thompson, UT's leading tackler who sat out last week with a
sprained ankle but will play Saturday, and Eric Westmoreland, whose
vicious hit led to a fumble return for a touchdown. Chavis calls
the three linebackers ``probably the best group we've had
overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill says he thinks it's Tennessee's best overall defense,
especially up front. ``They bring people in, it doesn't make a
difference,'' he said. ``They're still good.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the man in the middle, who can't wait to get back in
the midst of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pick up where I left off,'' Wilson said. ``I don't
want to go out and try to be Superman. Just make plays.''

 &HT;    Booker's improvement bolsters pass defense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons occasionally ``hide'' Michael
Booker with the help of a safety, but there's no hiding that he has
improved and that Atlanta's pass defense has done the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, the Falcons' defense has improved its
ranking from No. 23 to No. 17 to No. 9, allowing 301.3 yards a
game. Stronger pass defense is the biggest reason.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's last two opponents, Chicago and St. Louis, were poor
teams with struggling quarterbacks. But when a defense gives up 129
and 104 passing yards, respectively, as the Falcons (10-2) did,
plenty is going right.
</P>
<P>
   Before those two games, Atlanta's pass defense ranked last in
the NFL, giving up an average of about 250 yards, including 307
yards to the 49ers. The unit is ranked No. 25 now, allowing 225.4
yards per game, while the front seven is No. 2 against the run.
``We're covering better,'' said defensive coordinator Rich Brooks,
whose unit allowed net passing totals of 205 and 207 yards in wins
against St. Louis and New England before the 49ers game.
``(Cornerback) Ray (Buchanan) is playing very well, and Booker is
really improved. And (cornerbacks Ronnie) Bradford and (Randy)
Fuller have been very good in the nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker, a second-year cornerback from Nebraska, was a
disappointment last year as a first-round draft choice. He had a
difficult time defending deep routes and keeping his balance when
he tried to play physically. When Bradford injured a knee on Oct.
25, Booker, a 6-foot-2, 203-pounder, moved into the lineup. In five
consecutive starts, all wins, he is playing more the way that the
Falcons expected when they signed him to a five-year, $8.2 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who usually covers the opposing team's best receiver,
is playing at a Pro Bowl level. He is tied for the NFC lead with
five interceptions and has defensed a team-high 18 passes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Brooks has trusted Booker more, and the
resulting increase in man-to-man and bump-and-run coverage is
working. Booker, who is second on the team with eight passes
defensed, hasn't been beaten deep yet, although free safety Eugene
Robinson or nickel safety Devin Bush often roll behind Booker.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta beat San Francisco 31-19, Booker held 6-2,
218-pound 49ers receiver J.J. Stokes to one catch for 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Michael playing better, we believe we can match up with
anyone,'' Buchanan said. ``He's running with receivers a lot
better. He's getting his hands on receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has said that Bradford (5-10, 188) will start
again when he is healthy. But given the team's investment in Booker
and the way he's playing, there's no rush.
</P>
<P>
   More bump-and-run coverage means more blitzing, which helps
explain the Falcons' 14 sacks the past four games.

 &HT;    Moss wasn't for the Birds
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last the NFL apportioned flesh, 19 teams chose to
pass on Randy Moss instead of pass to him. As of today, that stands
as the kind of mass blunder that gives lemmings and witch hunts a
bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Akin to 19 record companies auditioning the Beatles and telling
them, ``Cut your hair, get Ringo more involved, then we'll talk.''
Or to 19 editors informing John Grisham, ``Nobody wants to read
about lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the NBA, now officially the world's daftest league, got
around to drafting Michael Jordan by the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   Every catch Moss makes, every defensive back he turns into
statuary, every time he laps the ordinary, he also tightens the
collars of front-office soldiers from Seattle to Foxboro. He stands
to become a once-in-a-generation type of player, the latest in the
line, a Jerry Rice-squared. And leave in his wake more
second-guessing and regret than a week's worth of Las Vegas
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, against Dallas _ the team that was most likely to
draft Moss before he fell to Minnesota _ he exacted his latest
measure of revenge. Just three catches, that's all. But each a
touchdown, each 51 yards or more. It was a good, old-fashioned
holiday vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Moss figures to get around to everybody sooner of later. He is
payback's personal chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, during a season otherwise free of vexing questions,
there is this: Would you rather have Randy Moss or Keith Brooking?
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to see the damage done by Moss and not picture
him working instead in the Falcons' dome. Can't help but think of
the artistic flourishes he could add to the Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone is obsessing on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had it to do over again, we'd do exactly the same
thing,'' said the father of all things Falcon, Dan Reeves. What,
you were expecting him to break down and beg for a draft-day
mulligan?
</P>
<P>
   Regret, which once clung to the Falcons like a birthmark,
refuses to stick now.
</P>
<P>
   No, Moss never was as much as a tickle in the back of Reeves'
throat when their first pick arrived. ``With what we're trying to
do (in building from the foundation), we couldn't afford to take
the risk,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Moss' character questions, heightened by the way he avoided
pre-draft exposure, made him a considerable risk. Much of the
damage was self-inflicted. And Minnesota might just be a unique
situation where Moss can flourish (although I'd take Terance Mathis
as a mentor anytime). All that tends to get drowned out in the
noise he now produces.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went for a linebacker who is slowly becoming more
and more visible in limited playing time. While the player drafted
nine spots below him is the sensation of the season. This was a
vote for the certificate of deposit over the new-issue stock.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves still isn't ready to get speculative. ``(Moss) is doing a
tremendous job. He's been a great asset. The future is still one of
the things that concerns you. Anybody can deal with success. When
the going gets tough, will it all hold up?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of franchises are looking at the huge one that got away _
Tennessee drafted another wide receiver instead, Cincinnati picked
over Moss twice. Reasons and rationalizations abound, many of them
sound. But I can't help myself. I am incapable of looking on this
player and not uttering, ``What if?''

ALBRIGHT SPEAKS OF HER FAMILY'S LOSS IN THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright chose the
opening session of a three-day conference on Holocaust-era assets
to talk emotionally Tuesday about her Jewish roots and the loss of
family members she never knew.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she had ``not yet found, and may never find, exactly
the right words'' to talk about roots that she has said she did not
learn about until last year, Albright evoked her grandparents and
other relatives who died in Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young,'' she said, ``I didn't often think about
grandparents. I just knew I didn't have any. Now I, too, have
become a grandparent, and I look at my children's children, and the
love and pride literally overflows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of the blood that is in my family's veins,'' said
Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia and whose family fled to
London just before the outbreak of World War II. ``Does it matter
what kind of blood it is? It shouldn't. But it mattered to Hitler.
And that matters to us all, because that is why 6 million Jews
died. That is why this obscenity of suffering was visited on so
many innocent and irreplaceable people.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, when The Washington Post disclosed her
Jewish identity, Albright was reluctant to discuss the issue and
said through a former spokesman, Nicholas Burns, that it was a
personal matter and ``not a foreign policy issue, and it's not
going to have an impact on the way she does her job.''
</P>
<P>
   But as she addressed delegates from 44 countries and 13 Jewish
and Romani organizations in a wood-paneled auditorium at the State
Department, Albright made of her family's history a public reminder
that differences in culture, language, history and choice of
worship make life interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as the Holocaust cries out to us,'' she told the
gathering, ``we must never allow these distinctions to obscure the
common humanity that binds all people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remembering that lesson is what this effort at research and
restitution of Holocaust-era assets is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright finished by urging delegates to ``do everything within
our power to replace darkness with light, injustice with fairness,
contention with consensus and falsehood with truth.''
</P>
<P>
   They responded with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rubin, a spokesman for the State Department, said Albright
has spoken many times about genocide. But the fact that this was
her first address about the Holocaust since she learned of her
heritage influenced her decision to speak personally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was only one weight on the consciences of conference
attendees to find ways to make restitution to families who lost
property to the Nazis. In the opening ceremony on Monday night,
they heard speeches by Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate;
Miles Lerman, a Holocaust survivor who is chairman of the Holocaust
museum in Washington; and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat,
the conference organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel said he wanted to ask a few questions before delegates
began ``three days of introspection.'' Among them were, ``Why so
late?'' and, ``Why only now?''
</P>
<P>
   As delegates began grappling with restitution issues Tuesday, it
was immediately clear that gold _ the subject of a conference in
London a year ago that established a fund to aid survivors _ was
one thing, but that contested art would be a far more difficult
problem to solve. Insurance, communal property once owned by Jewish
and other religious groups and Holocaust education issues are also
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With the emotionally charged issue of looted art, no global
settlement appears possible, as gold and insurance seem to allow.
On Thursday, Eizenstat plans to present a dozen principles to guide
claimants and current owners of contested works, which he hopes the
conference will adopt. They ask countries to search the art
holdings in public and private museums to identify and publicize
examples of Nazi-confiscated art. Countries would be asked to open
their archives to researchers, to establish a central database and
to allow for unavoidable data gaps about a work's provenance.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat's proposal, however, skirts more contentious issues.
It barely mentions, for example, one of the main barriers blocking
restitution in Europe. Unlike the United States, where the
purchaser of a stolen work of art never gets clear title to it,
European countries give clear title to good-faith purchasers after
a period as short as three years from the original theft.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust-claim advocates are hoping European countries would
agree to exemptions for wartime booty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international art market must be open, stable and free of
uncertainty that it might be trading in works that are tainted by
Nazi looting,'' Eizenstat said.

MERGER WAVE AMONG INDEPENDENTS COULD BUT NUMBER OF LARGER
INDEPENDENTS IN HALF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They tried cost-cutting. They formed alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the major oil companies _ faced with the specter of
depressed oil prices for years to come _ are trying yet another
strategy: creation of the mega-major.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Corp.'s planned $75.6 billion purchase of rival Mobil
Corp., if approved by regulators, would create the world's largest
oil company.
</P>
<P>
   This new behemoth would be big enough to take on another newly
forming giant, BP-Amoco and the current world heavyweight, Royal
Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
   Further consolidation appears all but inevitable, analysts say,
as the world's remaining oil producers try to compete with this new
ruling triumvirate and reward their shareholders in an increasingly
difficult business climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low oil prices are pushing them over the cliff,'' said Fadel
Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Every
company is saying, `We can't do it alone. We can't do it alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, France's Total announced plans to buy the Belgian
oil company Petrofina for $11.6 billion in stock to form the
world's sixth-largest publicly trade oil company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. majors such as Chevron Corp. and Texaco, too small even
together to create a credible fourth competitor, are likely to get
absorbed by the Big Three, predicted Ron Oligney, a professor of
petroleum engineering at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The industry will soon see ``probably one other mega-merger,
possibly between a large European oil company and a large U.S.
major,'' suggested Victor Burk, Arthur Andersen's managing
director, energy industry, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Not all observers are delighted to see this consolidation
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next merger will be Germany acquiring France,'' said Ed
Rothschild, a longtime oil industry critic with Podesta Associates
in Washington. ``This company has got more revenues than the GNP of
most of the world's nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's bid to snatch up Mobil comes as crude prices _ adjusted
for inflation _ have plunged to their lowest levels since 1972,
prior to the Arab Oil embargo and the first oil price shock.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch in New
York, calculates, using 1963 dollars, that crude was fetching about
$2.11 a barrel, or roughly a nickel a gallon, this week. ``I'd say
that's cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Few oil analysts are predicting a major rebound in oil prices
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of East Asia, which for years represented the only
real growth markets for crude oil, have been hobbled by a severe
economic and currency crisis that could drag on for years. Last
month, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that
the Asian economic downturn could haunt oil prices until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the once-formidable Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries _ which still accounts for about 40 percent of
world production _ failed to make commitments on further production
cuts _ sending crude prices tumbling toward $11 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the oil companies have faced an
extended period of low oil prices. But since the Oil Bust in the
mid-1980s, the oil companies have engaged in round after round of
layoffs and often-innovative strategies in an effort to keep their
costs in line.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco, for example, has drastically pared back the foreign
countries in which it operates. Amoco and Shell teamed up to
jointly operate their oil and gas properties in West Texas and
southeastern New Mexico, while Pennzoil Co. even reduced the
tea-drinking choices of its corporate staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the oil companies could find only so much fat to trim. In
today's price environment, analysts say, the they have been forced
to take more drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of energy companies had done most or all of the
cost-cutting that they could do themselves, and the only way to
achieve additional significant cost savings is to merge with
somebody else and eliminate the duplication,'' said Kerry North,
managing director of Wasserstein Perella's Dallas office.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil estimate their merger would generate an annual
cost savings of $2.8 billion, while BP and Amoco have pegged their
savings at $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   By launching a new wave of consolidation, the majors also are
following a pattern set back in the early 1980s, when oil prices _
instead of heading ever upwards _ veered south. Texaco bought Getty
Oil. Chevron picked up Gulf Oil. Mobil acquired Superior Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is under way in nearly every aspect of the energy
business, including the oil-field service sector and among
independent oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the few months, oil-field service giant Halliburton Co.
purchased Dresser Industries, Baker Hughes bought Western Atlas and
Schlumberger acquired Camco.
</P>
<P>
   But the factors driving those acquisitions _ a desire to extend
their product lines and better serve their customers _ are
different from those prompting mergers such as the Exxon-Mobil
deal, said Matt Simmons, president of Houston's Simmons &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The independent oil producers, often more sensitive to low oil
and gas prices than the majors and much less able to carry their
debt loads, are looking for deals of their own. Last week,
Houston-based Seagull Energy Corp.'s unveiled a proposed $1.1
billion merger with Ocean Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Gheit believes the merger wave among the independents
could cut the number of larger independents in half. &QL;

   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the

INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

SCRAPBOOKS: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL BE FAMILY TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For purchase information and to obtain photos, call New York Times
Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or
(212) 499-3333.) &HT;    
 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No doubt there's a shoebox or two up in your closet just
overflowing with snapshots dating back to your child's first
birthday, your wedding ... maybe your own childhood. How do I know
all this? Just take a look in my closets!
 &HT;    You can turn those treasured photos into albums that will become
great holiday gifts _ and family heirlooms.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking, the popular craft of creating ``memory books,''
has been sweeping the western and southern parts of the United
States for the past few years. It is quickly becoming the '90s
version of the quilting bee. Its popularity has even spread to
England, Australia and Japan.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is simple. But the list of products _ and the
terminology _ can sound intimidating to the beginner. Acid-free?
Polyurethane? Archival quality?
 &HT;    Not to worry. Just follow these simple instructions and you'll
finish your first scrapbook page in no time. And trust me _ you'll
be hooked.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that photos preserved in this fashion should
still be in good shape at least 200 years from now. I can't say the
same for my high school photo album, a magnetic album that has
turned my photos gummy and brown around the edges _ and I'm not
that old! What better treasure to pass on to your children _ and
your great-great-grandchildren.
 WHAT IS SCRAPBOOKING?  
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is a way to preserve photographs and other
memorabilia in a safe, acid-free environment. Acid can weaken and
discolor paper. As long as you choose acid-free, archival-quality
(meaning material that can be safely used for preservation
purposes) paper, pens, adhesive and sheet-protectors, you really
can't go wrong. The only thing you add is photos, love and a little
imagination.
 &HT;    Here's how to get started:
 &HT;    1. Get organized. Group your photos by year or by subject. Most
experts recommend starting with your most recent photographs and
working back in time. Because magnetic-page photo albums are quite
harmful to photos, consider removing photos from old albums and
storing them by date in a heavy-duty, acid-free photo-storage box
(which can be purchased inexpensively at most camera stores and
photo shops) until you have time to add them to your scrapbook.
 &HT;    2. Buy supplies. There is an overwhelming array of scrapbooking
products available at craft stores, stationery stores and rubber
stamp stores and by mail order. There are even stores devoted just
to scrapbooking. But all you really need to get started is the
following:
 &HT;    + Photos. Order double prints.
 &HT;    + Acid-free mounting paper, polyurethane archival-quality page
protectors and a three-ring binder. Some people prefer to use 8 1/2
x 11-inch sheets stored in sheet protectors in binders. Others use
albums of different sizes that are pre-filled with acid-free paper.
 &HT;    + Regular household scissors.
 &HT;    + Acid-free adhesive _ glue stick, photo corners or
peel-and-stick squares.
 &HT;    + Acid-free pen for ``journaling'' _ adding names, dates and
comments to the page.
 &HT;    Starter kits containing most of the above can be purchased at
many craft stores for about $25. To further enhance your pages, you
may wish to buy such items as paper punches, stickers, circle
cutters, colored paper and pens, templates for cutting shapes,
fancy-edged scissors.
 &HT;    3. Pick a theme. Christmas? Your child's birthday party? The
school picnic? Whatever your theme, play with groupings of photos.
Be choosy. Use only your best photos, whether it's one special
photo alone on a page or a grouping of four or five.
 &HT;    4. Crop and mat. You may want to crop your photos to sharpen
their focus. Trim around the most important part of the photo,
removing excess background or unnecessary elements. If you are
using old family photos or other irreplaceable photos, make color
copies and work from those.
 &HT;    You can use plain or patterned paper to create a mat. Just glue
your photo to the paper and trim around the edges, leaving a border
showing. Double- or triple-matted photos look great, too.
 &HT;    5. Add the finishing touches. After you've chosen a layout, it's
time to glue down your photos and to add stickers, stamps and _
most important _ journaling.
 &HT;    Add dates and names, of course. But don't stop there. Add
details that will make the photos come alive for future
generations. Tell a funny story about how your dog ate the
Thanksgiving turkey. List your child's five favorite songs next to
a photo showing her singing. Describe where and how far your son
hiked on the Boy Scout camping trip. It's those details that make
your scrapbook a real family treasure.
 &HT;    6. Pass it around. One of the most rewarding parts of
scrapbooking is sharing the finished book with your family. Kids
can learn a lot from looking at scrapbooks. Older kids enjoy
looking back on family activities and sharing the book with
friends. Toddlers and preschoolers learn names of family members,
pick up lots of new words and enjoy looking at themselves when they
were ``just babies.''
 &HT;    And all kids feel like VIPs as they turn the pages. After all,
they're the stars of their very own book.

AMERICA'S FIRST CHRISTMAS CARD

or (212) 499-3333.
 &HT;    
 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Once a year, Christmas cards flood America's mailboxes. Once a
year, countless fingers go numb from signing and addressing stacks
of them.
 &HT;    How did this tradition come to be?
 &HT;    The first Christmas card can be traced to a long-forgotten
businessman named Richard H. Pease. History records little of Pease
except that he was a skilled lithographer and printer who set up
shop in Albany in 1850. In 1851, whether in a fit of Yuletide
whimsy or in a savvy burst of self-promotion, he put bold black ink
to stiff, pristine white paper and crafted an intricate design.
 &HT;    On 4 1/2-by-6-inch cards, the holiday entrepreneur fashioned
images that later generations might have deemed too ``busy'' in
such a limited space, but that Americans of the 1850s found
perfectly fitting, given the mid-19th century affinity for
Victorian vistas and Currier &AMP; Ives prints.
 &HT;    A gracefully curved line of holly adorned the bottom of the
card, and prominently above the inked leaves ran the creator's
advertisement _ ``Pease's Great Variety Store in the Temple of
Fancy.''
 &HT;    ``Temple of Fancy'' perfectly described the images crowding the
card, Pease having turned his imagination and his drawing hand
loose in a burst of Christmas creativity. Featured in his holiday
motifs was, of course, Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Pease's Santa, however, bore only a passing resemblance to the
rotund St. Nick that famed 19th-century caricaturist Thomas Nast
later stamped upon the nation's collective imagination. The
businessman's Santa appeared on the card as a small, rather elflike
Santa Claus with a fur-trimmed cap.
 &HT;    Pease's card also featured scenes of how middle- and upper-class
Americans of the day celebrated Christmas. Arrayed around the
card's four corners were Christmas presents, Christmas dishes and
Christmas drinks, all hinting of mouthwatering holiday repasts and
heartfelt toasts.
 &HT;    In the card's center, a young, handsome couple, faces redolent
of holiday cheer and financial comfort, enjoyed the Yuletide
exuberance of their three children. Behind the beaming family, a
servant was setting an elaborate holiday dinner, a familiar scene
in affluent and middle-class households throughout the United
States. Reflecting an equally familiar but more disturbing reality
of 1850s American life was the black servant bustling about the
table.
 &HT;    Whether they knew it or not, friends and customers peering at
Pease's landmark cards, with their vivid black and white tones and
their boldly inked message, ``A Merry Christmas and A Happy New
Year,'' literally held the future theme of the Christmas card in
their hands.
 &HT;    Pease's card also contained the stuff of printers' nightmares.
To his friends' and customers' probable amusement and to his
certain chagrin, the engraver's cards included a misspelled word:
``Pease's Great Varety Store.''
 &HT;    In 1874, 24 years after Pease's flight of holiday fancy
materialized, Massachusetts lithographer Louis Prang unveiled a
line of beautiful commercial Christmas cards that spawned a
lucrative industry and earned him the sobriquet ``Father of the
American Christmas Card.''
 &HT;    For generations to come, Prang, whose pleasant, white-whiskered
features resembled those of the Santas in his popular cards, was
hailed as the first American to craft Christmas cards. Pease's
milestone card slipped into historical obscurity, eclipsed by the
commercial and artistic feat of Prang, who would long receive
mistaken acclaim as the creator of the very first American
Christmas card.
 &HT;    In 1954, greeting card authority Gyorgy Buday completed his
detailed book ``The History of the Christmas Card,'' which credited
Prang as the creator of the Christmas card. His publisher was at
the page-proof stage, when the author had a surprise for his
editors.
 &HT;    Buday had just received a letter from E.D. Chase, who had
enclosed a copy of ``the first American Christmas card'' -- Richard
Pease's card.
 &HT;    Buday went on to anoint Pease's card as the first: ``No date
appears on the lithograph itself, but as a result of some
considerable research, Mr. Chase satisfactorily established that it
must be either 1850, 1 or 2, since it was only these three years
that Mr. Pease occupied the building which is pictured prominently
on the card.''
 &HT;    Other scholars of Americana followed Buday's attempt to assign
Pease's card its proper place in the greeting card firmament. That
Prang had created the first commercially successful cards remains
clear. But Pease's creation stands as the nation's first bonafide
Christmas card.
 &HT;    We will never know if Pease's marriage of Christmas and commerce
bloomed ahead of its time, or if he, unlike Prang in the 1870s,
simply failed to parlay his idea into a holiday fortune.

 Hanukkah Bushes? Bah, Humbug!

sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or (212) By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I come from humbug beginnings. Raised as a Jew, I sat on Santa's
lap once at a department store, but it wasn't encouraged. My mother
likely gave in because I was too young to understand the cosmic
implications.
 &HT;    Today, I consider it treason when Jews create ``Hanukkah
bushes'' or exchange gifts on Christmas. Me, who doesn't belong to
a synagogue or light sabbath candles, yet still feel my roots erupt
when assaulted by Christmas.
 &HT;    The unbidden feelings come from years of singing Yuletide carols
in elementary school and being asked too many times what I did for
``The Holiday.'' When I answer indifferently that I worked, went to
a movie or grabbed a bite in Chinatown, people are suddenly quiet.
 &HT;    There's nothing like Christmas to make a Jew feel like a
minority. I know someone in Harleysville, Pa., who looked high and
low for Hanukkah candles. After painfully trying to describe to
clueless salespeople what menorah candles looked like, a clerk
suggested he use birthday candles _ a ludicrous concept to anyone
who knows the difference. The same person complained to a local
Wal-Mart manager when he couldn't find a Jewish New Year's card in
stock at Rosh Hashanah.
 &HT;    Most of the holiday cards I receive are bald-faced Christmas
cards usually from people who: 1) know I am Jewish, and 2) do not
know that Hanukkah began two weeks before Christmas.
 &HT;    While some feature neutral winter landscapes, others are
foil-embossed nativity scenes or living rooms steeped in candy
canes and boughs of holly. Sure, it's the thought that counts, but
a little more thinking could have gone a long way.
 &HT;    One year I happened upon a great series of cards called ``Mixed
Blessings.'' These cards use playful interdenominational pictures,
such as Santa skating a Star of David on ice or a reindeer with
antlers shaped like a menorah. Perfect to send anyone in the spirit
of unity.
 &HT;    Still, if you want to get technical, Hanukkah is not top billing
in the ranks of Jewish holidays. When you care enough to send the
very best, send a card for the Jewish New Year, usually in
September.
 &HT;    Really, I'm not a grinch. I think the holiday season is a great
nudge for keeping tabs on faraway friends. Bragging family form
letters aside, I enjoy receiving their cards with news of a new
baby or a career switch. Likewise, I, too, have been known to think
about the people in my life each December who deserve a note from
the heart, seasonal or otherwise.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For kids with computers, there's no better gift this holiday
season than new software. The children's software market has
exploded this year, with more exciting and innovative programs than
ever before. Kids can raise their own virtual dragon, play a
scavenger hunt game with the cast of Blue's Clues and even learn
about physics as they build their own pinball machines.
 &HT;    There's a new crop of gizmos and gadgets, too, that extend
computer technology beyond the PC. Lego Mindstorms, for instance,
lets your children construct and program real, moving robots out of
Legos. This is a great time to be a kid!
 &HT;    Here's the scoop on the hottest children's software of the year,
along with some shopping and installation tips.

$19.99.
 &HT;    Make a Masterpiece

 SIDEBAR: SHOPPING AND INSTALLATION HINTS  
 &HT;    + Avoid impulse buys. Don't be fooled by fancy packaging. Do
your homework first by reading reviews and talking to friends.
 &HT;    + Check system requirements. Make sure you are buying something
your computer can handle. Minimum system requirements are always
listed on the boxes.
 &HT;    + Try before you buy. Many companies will let you play limited
versions of their programs on their websites or will send you a
demo CD. Call the company's 800 number for details.
 &HT;    + Install the software prior to the gift-giving. If at all
possible, install the software on your computer beforehand, make
sure it runs then rewrap the gift. Potential Christmas morning
disaster averted!

 &HT;    
 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As almost everyone knows, more than 100 years ago in Manhattan
8-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon wrote a letter to the editor of the
New York Sun to ask if there really was a Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Had that youngster lived 50 years earlier in certain parts of
the United States, she might well have asked if there was even a
Christmas.
 &HT;    Until the middle of the 1800s, throughout much of America,
Christmas was much like any other day of the just-begun winter.
Most families then were farm folk, and the darkening days before
the winter solstice were simply times to rest up, fix up and save
up for the hard work of the coming agricultural season. Perhaps the
butchering of a hog enlivened the cold-weather chores, or a
quilting bee quickened the social scene.
 &HT;    This widespread indifference to the holiday can be explained by
the fact that most of our ancestors had no knowledge of the
traditions that were beginning to arrive here from Europe, and many
harbored strong religious objections to an event that sprang from
ancient pagan festivities.
 &HT;    In truth, beginning with the Puritans in early New England, and
continuing two centuries through the Great Awakening, many
sobersided naysayers deeply disliked the celebrations that came
from the Old World. ``Blasphemy'' and ``mockery,'' such persons
grumped. One prominent Protestant preacher of that era stoutly
announced, ``To me Christmas is a foreign day, and I shall die
so.''
 &HT;    Most rural people thus spent Christmas ignoring the celebrating,
with doors and minds shut to seasonal merrymaking. Indeed, by 1850
there was so little regard in America for Christmas that only a few
of our 31 states had declared it a legal holiday.
 &HT;    In the latter half of the 19th century, however, religious
opposition declined. Christmas then became a more secular season,
as Old World customs evolved into an American Yuletide culture.
 &HT;    For instance, from England came the exchange of greeting cards,
a tradition traced back to one Henry Cole. In 1843 he impulsively
dashed off picture cards in place of his long-overdue seasonal
letters that were required by strict Victorian etiquette.
 &HT;    In 1851 the card-exchange idea arrived in this country, when
Richard H. Pease decorated his business cards with holiday
messages. More than 20 years later Louis Prang commercialized the
idea with the release of a line of Christmas cards, spawning a
profitable business for Hallmark and a harrowing job for the postal
system.
 &HT;    The Germans contributed the Christmas tree, though people who
migrated to areas devoid of evergreens had to settle for other
native species.
 &HT;    In 1848 the tree-as-centerpiece notion was given a boost in
America when Godey's Lady's Book published an engraving of Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert admiring the tree they had decorated for
their royal young. However, the tree then was just a tabletop
ornament. Only later did it evolve into its floor-to-ceiling
splendor.
 &HT;    In 1850 Charles Dickens, already famous for his ``Christmas
Carol,'' described one such upper-class evergreen: ``It was
brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers, everywhere
sparkling with bright objects, rosy-cheeked dolls, domestic
furniture wonderfully made of tin, jolly broad-faced men, fiddles,
drums, paint boxes, guns, banners, humming tops, and imitation
fruit made dazzling with gold leaf.''
 &HT;    That was all well and good for the wealthy set, of course. But
since the mass manufacture and marketing of toys was only in its
infancy in America, ordinary children lucky enough to observe
Christmas at all likely got homemade ``playpretties'' _ products of
a mother's sewing basket or a father's workbench.
 &HT;    Our modern image of Santa similarly came from overseas _
Holland, Scandinavia, Germany and France. But the picture that
eventually became fixed in our minds _ a jolly bewhiskered,
red-garbed fellow with more than an ample waistline _ was largely
the gift of Clement C. Moore, whose poem ``A Visit From St.
Nicholas'' not only defined the man himself but also set forever
the belief that Santa flies through the air on a reindeer-drawn
sleigh.
 &HT;    Today, of course, Christmas is big business, with its sales
pitch beginning well before first frost. Children snuggle fitfully
in their bed with fond hopes that Ninja and Nintendo will (not so
magically) appear in their stockings come morning.
 &HT;    When Francis Church, editor of the New York Sun, replied to
Virginia O'Hanlon so long ago, he little realized what Santa and
Christmas were to become. But he did assure his young correspondent
that Santa was and is more a matter of heart and hope than of
things in hand.
 &HT;    ``He lives in terms of love and generosity and devotion,''
Church wrote, adding, ``No one can imagine all the wonders that are
quite unseen.''

FEC RECOMMENDS HUGE REPAYMENT FROM CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING FROM
CLINTON, DOLE  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Election Commission officials recommended
Tuesday that the presidential campaigns of Democrat Bill Clinton
and Republican Bob Dole repay millions of dollars in taxpayer
funds, charging they illegally benefited from advertising done in
coordination with their political parties.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an audit of the 1996 campaign, the officials said
that the Dole campaign should repay $17.7 million and the Clinton
campaign $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors alleged that both campaigns violated election laws
by coordinating with the Republican National Committee and the
Democratic National Committee in the creation and airing of so
called ``issue ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff recommendation will be reviewed by the six-member
Federal Election Commission on Thursday. The commission, which is
equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, has often
altered or ignored recommendations of its staff in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen from the Republican and Democratic parties Tuesday
denied there was any illegal coordination with the presidential
campaigns and vowed to fight the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is an outrageous opinion,'' said Clifford May, a
spokesman for the RNC. ``It is wrong to be subjecting Bob Dole to
this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC General Counsel Joe Sandler and Clinton Gore '96 general
counsel Lyn Utrecht issued a statement saying ``we have a
fundamental disagreement with the recommendations of the Federal
Election Commission staff regarding the party issue advertising in
1995 and 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings come at a particularly sensitive time as the
Justice Department and congressional committees are investigating
alleged abuses during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the abuses being probed was the widespread use of issue
ads, or spots run by parties or outside organizations that are
supposed to promote various issues but not specifically promote one
candidate over another.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors contended that the Republican and Democratic
parties crafted ads that benefited their presidential candidates
even though they did not specifically urge voters to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the auditors determined the cost of the ads should
have been counted as contributions to the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Since both candidates received federal funds for their elections
they were subject to contribution limits for the primary and
general election races.
</P>
<P>
   When the auditors added up the cost of the issue ads they found
both candidates had exceeded their contribution caps and determined
they should refund the excess money to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   FEC spokesman Ian Stirton said that issue ads are a fairly new
phenomena and that the agency has increasingly grappled with
whether such spots fall under federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Stirton said that the agency's auditors have taken the more
expansive view that an ad can be interpreted as promoting a
candidate even if it doesn't outright urge voters to back one
candidate over another.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 1996 Democratic and Republican ads, he said
``they were clearly intended to get the candidate elected. They
weren't just issue ads on the issues of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   One of 37 ads run by the DNC contrasted Dole's purported
attempts to cut funding for certain programs, such as new police
hiring and anti-drug programs, with Clinton's efforts to save those
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC report concludes that the ad is ``designed to garner
public support for a certain candidate, namely President Clinton
and diminish public support for Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the report also pointed to several GOP ads, including
one highlighting Clinton's promise not to raise taxes on the middle
class and then claiming that he pushed the largest tax increase in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with other ads, this message appears to have the purpose of
diminishing support for President Clinton in the election year,''
the auditors concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors also stressed that officials with the campaigns
meticulously coordinated their advertising efforts with the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Dole campaign manager Scott Reed attended weekly
strategy meetings held by then RNC chairman Haley Barbour. It also
stated that the party and the campaign used the same vendors,
pollsters and consultants for the advertising effort.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the FEC report contends the Democratic Party and the
Clinton-Gore campaign coordinated events, placing their ads in the
same market, using the same consultants and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representatives from the White House, the DNC, and
Clinton/Gore would meet at the White House approximately once a
week to discuss media, polling, speech writing and police and issue
positioning,'' the FEC auditors stated. &QL;

 &HT;    Campaign finance practices to be scrutinized by Judiciary
CommitteeBy Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _As it heard new testimony about the importance of
perjury, the bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee voted along
party lines Tuesday to subpoena new information about whether
President Clinton violated campaign finance laws. The committee is
seeking internal memos from FBI Director Louis Freeh and former
Justice Department official Charles LaBella about their findings
during investigations of Democratic campaign fund-raising
practices. Both Freeh and LaBella have urged Attorney General Janet
Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the
allegations of fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and LaBella were also subpoenaed to get their analysis of
the evidence the memos contain.
</P>
<P>
   Their memos were introduced in evidence before a federal grand
jury investigating allegations that foreign contributors may have
tried to influence administration policy by donating large sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critical in our investigation as it was in the campaign
fund-raising investigation,'' said Georgia Republican Rep. Bob
Barr, who sits on both the Judiciary Committee and the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the panel that has spent
the better part of the last two years and $7 million investigating
the campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he suspects that that the memos describe the
president's involvement in the questionable way money was raised
during the 1996 presidential election, and that makes it the duty
of the impeachment panel to obtain them to see if the president's
actions rise to the level of an impeachable crime.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee is seeking the memos from Reno, their
release must be approved by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who called a closed-door hearing for today to discuss the
matter. Johnson issued a sealed ruling last Friday stating that the
committee had not demonstrated sufficient need for the memos, which
she kept under seal because they include secret grand jury
material. Committee Republicans believe the subpoena will
strengthen their argument to disclose them.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also subpoenaed material from Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr on John Huang, a former Democratic fund-raiser whose
ex-employer paid money to presidential friend Webster Hubbell.
Starr is investigating whether that payment and other consulting
fees represented ``hush money'' to keep Hubbell quiet about any
wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, (R-Ill.), committee chairman, insisted that the
expansion of the investigation would not destroy his self-imposed
deadline of Dec. 31 for ending the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely committed myself to wrapping this up this
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But committee spokesman Paul McNulty conceded the new line of
inquiry could expand the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tough _ if credible evidence of wrongdoing is
discovered _ to stick with our schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the escalating tension between the two sides,
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt wrote out-going House Speaker Newt
Gingrich (R-Ga.) a letter expressing his ``deepest concern'' for
the way the impeachment inquiry has turned into ``chaos due to the
lack of direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it is incumbent on you to provide the
leadership necessary to move this process forward,'' said Gephardt.
Gingrich spokesperson Christina Martin said that there is a
structure in place that should be followed and that structure is
under the leadership of Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans viewed the day-long hearing as an
opportunity to do exactly what Gephardt is requesting.
</P>
<P>
   By having a hearing featuring the likes of federal judges,
including Judge Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, and
convicted perjurers, Republicans said they hoped to educate the
public about the seriousness of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority Leader Gephardt says he fears that the inquiry lacks
direction,'' said Hyde. ``It is my view his real fear is not the
lack of direction, but rather that we are moving in the right
direction--getting to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that he found it ``particularly disturbing and indeed
shameful, that many who generally claim to represent the weak now
argue that the powerful should be allowed a pass when they break
the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee heard from judges, military officers and two women
prosecuted for lying in sex cases
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Republicans had staged the perjury session to
rally support for impeachment articles, which House leaders hope to
bring to a floor vote later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat was asked what would happen to the nation's system of
justice if perjury became commonplace. Comparing the system to a
three-legged stool, Tjoflat said the system functions only when
there there is an impartial judge, lawyers who obey the canons of
ethics and witnesses who take the oath sincerely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any one of those legs collapses, then the system is unable
to render justice,'' Tjoflat said. ``And of course, if it happens
repeatedly, then the people lose respect for the law, they lose
confidence in the system of justice, and they resort to other means
to resolve their disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the panel heard from Atlanta resident Pam
Parsons, a former University of South Carolina women's basketball
coach who pleaded guilty to a federal perjury charge in 1984 for
giving false testimony in a civil case about a sexual relationship
she had with one of her players.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said she was relieved to come before the committee to
describe her ``spiraling journey through hell'' to get to become a
truthful person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I could finally say I'm guilty,'' Parsons said. ``To
turn around and take a look at the other side of me took more guts
than it ever took to win a ball game. Now I truly know what it's
like to be a part of a team, and when that team can't trust you,
you've lost it all, and I would rather be who I am today than to
have continued coaching with a lie. ``

MARKET PLACE: WILL JAPANESE EMBRACE MUTUAL FUNDS SOLD BY BANKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sales of mutual funds through banks got off to what may
prove to be a deceptively quiet start in Japan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the nation's closely watched effort to deregulate its
financial markets starting April 1, banks and insurance companies
were allowed to begin selling mutual funds Tuesday, joining
brokerage firms in a push to draw more of Japan's $10 trillion in
personal savings out of bank deposits and into riskier investments.
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers have been able since earlier this year to rent
space in banks and set up booths to sell their products using their
own salespeople, although few did so, and many foreign firms have
been selling their funds using telephones and securities firm
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the banks, which have vast branch networks throughout Japan,
represent a huge opportunity to reach groups of customers so far
untapped.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, funds managed by Fidelity Investments, the largest
mutual fund company in the world, became available in almost 2,000
new outlets in the branches of 23 leading banks here. Previously,
the company sold funds through four brokerage firms _ Nomura
Securities, Nikko Securities, Daiwa Securities and Merrill Lynch _
and from booths set up in seven bank branches around Tokyo. Fund
management companies have been allowed to rent space in banks.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs, the foreign financial institution that has
attracted the most Japanese investment so far, with 1.6 trillion
yen ($13.2 billion) under management, gained roughly 500 new
outlets. Before, it had sold its funds through 18 brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Precise data on Tuesday's sales of mutual funds through banks
were not available. Fund managers and bank officials said there
were lines of customers in some branches but mostly they asked
questions and took pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to foresee what the business will be like from
today,'' said Yasuyo Yamazaki, president of Goldman Sachs
Investment Trust Management Co., a unit of Goldman, Sachs (Japan),
who spent Tuesday shuttling around bank branches and brokerage
offices to see the event from ground zero. ``My expectation is that
it's going to be a gradual process, but I was quite impressed by
what I saw. The banks are quite serious about this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamazaki and others expect banks in particular to become
important sales outlets because of the relationships the banks have
cultivated with their customers. Japanese bankers often make it a
point to greet customers by name and even send them small gifts
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Such attention may be an advantage in a country where the postal
savings system is considered the safest haven and mutual funds
represent a potential lucrative new business for banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are much more highly regarded in Japan than brokers,''
said Bill Wilder, president of Fidelity Investments Japan.
``They're offering customers a choice, not selling them one. It's a
different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotal evidence of Tuesday's tepid sales came as no
surprise to the foreign fund managers who have poured money into
the business here in hopes of capitalizing on deregulation. No one
yet knows whether the ultra-cautious Japanese investor _ whose
tolerance for earning a scant half-percent in interest continues to
amaze Western analysts _ will ever sink a significant portion of
savings into investment vehicles that offer a higher return but
only in exchange for higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Japanese appetite for mutual funds, never greatly in
demand here, has waned markedly, with accounts dropping to a record
low of 300,000 at the end of last year from 2.5 million in 1990.
Equity funds in particular, the funds that form the
bread-and-butter business of most foreign management companies,
have a spotty track record here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales will start fairly slowly and steadily and hopefully
build up to something meaningful for all of us,'' said Clifford
Shaw, head of Mercury Asset Management, a unit of Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. ``I think that's what you'd expect. They'll come in, ask for
information, take it away and then come back with more questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight years, Japanese investors have watched stock
prices get cut in half, have seen interest rates drop to historic
lows and have seen the value of the yen swing widely against the
dollar _ not to mention their having noticed that in a deflationary
environment like Japan, investors can effectively make money by
keeping it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The average Japanese investor regards his or her odds in the
stock market as little better than a crap-shoot, and thus far, the
mutual funds that have sold best here have been fixed-income funds
and balanced funds, which invest in a mix of bonds and stocks.
Partly as a nod to that preference, Fidelity Investments Japan
started two fixed-income funds Tuesday. And Yamazaki acknowledged
that investors thus far have preferred Goldman's fixed-income and
balanced funds to equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, American and European fund managers continue to
forge ahead _ and reap an ever-increasing share of the market. Of
the 44.2 trillion yen in net assets under management by investment
trust companies at the end of October, 9.3 percent, or 4.1 trillion
yen, was held by foreign managers, according to the Investment
Trust Association. At the end of March, foreign firms controlled
almost 7 percent of the market, with 2.7 trillion yen of the 38.5
trillion yen in net assets then under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a huge economy, you've got all these assets,
historically low interest rates, a rapidly aging population and
weak pension system, and yet the mutual fund industry is half the
size of Fidelity itself,'' Wilder said. ``Something is broken here,
but it won't get fixed until there is greater diversity in our
distribution, more widely available information and people like
ourselves and our competitors who are willing to educate and be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamazaki of Goldman pointed to Citibank's success in selling
foreign currency deposits, which carry the risk of fluctuations in
currency rates, a risk Japanese investors have historically been
unwilling to tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   When restrictions on holding foreign currency were abolished on
April 1, lines of customers spilled out of Citibank branches and
into the streets. ``The people visiting bank branches today and
asking for information, that's a typical and rational response to
something new,'' he said. ``This is not like buying Coke or gum. On
average, they're going to be investing $20,000 to $30,000, so
they're thinking about it.''

 &HT;    Radio station ends contest for 2 Beetles
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _They've run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   After 37 days, Top 40 radio station Star 94 (WSTR/94.1 FM) has
ended its wildly popular ``Live in It and Win It II'' contest
because ``we never imagined it could go on this long,'' says
general manager Mark Kanov.
</P>
<P>
   The station will hold a drawing at noon today to see which two
of the four remaining contestants will win the red and black
Volkswagen Beetles in which they have been living (with only brief
breaks) since before Halloween. No word yet on what the other two
contestants will receive.
</P>
<P>
   The news didn't seem to bother remaining car sitter Sonja Banks,
a Stone Mountain paralegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problems I've had are headaches. They've probably
stemmed from me being 6 foot and the positions I had to sleep in.
Thank God for the chiropractor they've had here. In a way, this has
been worse than incarceration. . . . If I don't win, I'll be
disappointed. But I knew at the beginning that I might not walk
away a winner. I endured until the end and prevailed. I won't be
going home and crying about it. I proved something to these guys
and I proved something to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the promotion began Oct. 26, thousands of Atlantans have
watched and listened to see who would last the longest in the two
cars parked inside North Point Mall(Alpharetta,Ga.). The contest
kicked off with eight people inside the Bugs, wearing their
mandatory seat belts. Jacqueline Sommers, 30, a homemaker from
Fayetteville(Ga.), bailed out after five days. Marc Azriel, 35, an
Atlanta sales rep, was disqualified on Day 6 when he returned from
a bathroom break 20 seconds late.
</P>
<P>
   When it looked like no one was going to budge, the station
managed to bribe two other contestants out of the cars. On Nov. 12,
Jennifer Roller, 25, of Suwanee, Ga., accepted a trip for two to
Los Angeles and a check for $2,000. A week later, Gainesville(Ga.)
mother of four Brenda Burke, 41, exited with $2,500 and a trip for
six to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four contestants _ Douglasville(Ga.) bartender
Kevin Danley, 31, independent contractor David Stephenson, 23,
free-lance Marietta(Ga.) filmmaker John Crow, 29, and Banks, 31 _
dug in for the duration. Star 94 tried in vain to rattle their
determination, ultimately making all four move into one car.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are so tenacious they will be in there forever,''
Kanov said. ``We thought this would end before Thanksgiving. It's
gotten to the point we're concerned for their health and families.
The rules said we could end it at any time, and they agreed, so
this is no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanov said the decision had nothing to do with the cost of
running the contest, which he estimated to be about $70,000 _ for
security, food, a live computer feed for the radio station's Web
site and the two cars themselves. Meanwhile, the radio station has
gotten a mother lode of publicity. Star 94 has experienced more
than 1 million hits on its Web site featuring live shots of the
people in the cars.
</P>
<P>
   After Kanov broke the news to the contestants Tuesday, the mood
was one of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got mixed emotions about it. It'll be nice to get out of
here and actually prepare for Christmas,'' Danley said. ``I think
it just got pretty clear to Star 94 that the four of us intended to
go the distance and that we weren't leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the first thing he's going to do when he gets out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go home, take a long, hot shower . . . jog five
miles and have a few celebration drinks. All the stuff that normal
people get to do.''

ANALYSIS: QUEBEC'S WOUNDED SEPARATISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ While the results of Quebec's provincial election are
muddy enough for both major parties to claim a victory of sorts,
and to bear some degree of defeat, the real losers are those who
had hoped the election would provide a clear sense of where Quebec,
and Canada, are heading.
</P>
<P>
   Although the separatists were returned to power, they could not
even muster a plurality of the popular vote. The election results
keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded.
</P>
<P>
   That means Premier Lucien Bouchard will not call another
wrenching referendum on breaking away from Canada any time soon,
though he has not ruled out doing so later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebecers have said that the time is not propitious for a
referendum, at least not immediately,'' Bouchard said Tuesday at a
news conference in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   He is clearly disappointed that he had not increased the number
of seats his party holds in the provincial assembly. Nor was he
able to maintain the percentage of the overall vote his party had
in the last elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti
Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal
Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase
of one. A small third party won one seat, and a special election
will be held in a few weeks for one district where the incumbent
died recently. That district is expected to go to the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular vote, which is seen as an indication of probable
strength for sovereignty, the separatists got 42.7 percent, while
the Liberals won 43.7 percent. A clear majority would be needed for
a referendum to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Bouchard refused to rule out completely the possibility of
holding another vote on separation. Instead, he reiterated the
position he took during the campaign: that he would call a
referendum _ which he has the right to do at any time during his
term _ when he could be sure it was winnable.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign Bouchard did not spell out the conditions
under which he would consider the vote winnable, and he skirted the
issue again Tuesday. But he has made it clear that several problems
must be tackled before conditions are ripe for another referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first was to be re-elected, but the separatists'
poorer-than-expected showing suggests that Bouchard will need
substantially more time than he had thought to lay the groundwork
for another referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how Bouchard can call a referendum in the near
future,'' said Francois Rocher, a professor of political science at
Carleton University in Ottawa. ``He was elected on good government
and now he will have to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said the first part of his term would be ``devoted to
achieving good government'' that would create winning conditions
for a referendum. He is nearing his goal of eliminating the
province's budget deficit, after several years of painful cuts.
Achieving that would be a sign of fiscal responsibility that the
separatists would use to build confidence in their ability to lead
an independent nation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beyond the budget, Bouchard will soon have to deal with Quebec's
large public employee unions, which have been without a contract
since June. And he is committed to negotiating a new deal with the
federal government, along with the leaders of the other nine
provinces, for more provincial control over health care and other
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   If the negotiations for a new federal relationship break down,
Bouchard could blame Ottawa and use resentment toward the federal
government to boster support for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's separatist predecessors as provincial premier
committed themselves to holding referendums without taking into
account whether conditions were ripe for a victory. Both previous
referendums were defeated, even though support for separation in
Quebec has at times risen to around 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bouchard refused to speculate about how long he was
willing to wait for his ``winning conditions'' to develop. He said
only that he would ``take the time that it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, some basic assumptions about Quebec were
openly questioned for the first time. The charge by the leader of
the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, that 30 years of toying with
separation had only hurt Quebec economically resonated with many
voters, including some French-speaking Quebecers. He also called
for limits to the provincial government's interference in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard will also have to deal with the defection of some soft
nationalists _ voters whose support for separation fluctuates _ to
the young, third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, leader of the
Democratic Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Dumont, 28, doubled his party's share of the popular vote,
although he was the only member who won a seat in the provincial
assembly. He called for a ten-year moratorium on referendums and
advocated free market measures, although he did not go as far as
Charest.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which aspects of Quebec life will continue to be
overshadowed by politics after the election was made clear early
Tuesday. The Canadian Olympic Committee announced that it had
turned down Quebec city in favor of Vancouver's bid to represent
Canada in vying for the 2010 winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The vote actually was taken 10 days ago but the announcement of
the results was delayed until Tuesday to avoid having any influence
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec politicians wasted no time in calling Tuesday's decision
political.

CLINTON TO ANNOUNCE NEW WATER PURITY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will travel Thursday to Newport,
R.I., to announce new federal measures to improve the quality of
drinking water and authorize the release of hundreds of millions of
dollars in loans to help states upgrade their water treatment
facilities, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations focus on eliminating the most harmful
pollutants in tap water, such as the cryptosporidium microbe, a
parasite that contaminated Milwaukee's water supply in 1993 and
sickened 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are part of amendments to the Safe Drinking
Water Act, which Clinton signed into law in 1996. The measure
significantly tightened standards for clean water and authorized
billions of dollars in a revolving loan fund over seven years to
improve deteriorating water systems.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stay, Clinton will tour the Bliss Mine Road
water purification plant in Newport and visit Fort Adams State
Park, where Narragansett Bay will serve as the backdrop as he lauds
the state for its comparatively high-quality water treatment
system.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be joined by Senator John H. Chafee, a
Republican from Rhode Island who co-authored the water act
amendments and is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires local water authorities for the first time
to annually disclose what chemicals and bacteria are in drinking
water and to give public notice within 24 hours of discovering a
dangerous contaminant in the water system. The measure also creates
a program to fight pollution at its source by keeping streams and
rivers clean and improving facilities that treat water before it
comes out of the tap.
</P>
<P>
   Citing data from the Centers for Disease Control, Chafee said
that about 900,000 people get ill each year from parasites such as
cryptosporidium, which causes most people to suffer cramps and
intestinal disorders. He said about 900 annually die from the
illness, particularly those with AIDS and weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The parasite is commonly found in lakes and rivers, especially
if the water has been contaminated with sewage or animal wastes.
Often it enters the water system during or after stormy weather
when sewers overflow.

ADVERTISERS PLAY A NEW TUNE: JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (Valerie Gladstone writes for jazzis magazine.)  
 (af)  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Turn on the television, and there's John Coltrane's resonant
saxophone in commercials for Jeep Cherokee and Burger King. Turn
the channel, and there's Dinah Washington singing ``Destination
Moon'' to sell Nike sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Open a magazine, and there's Lena Horne looking sharp in Gap
jeans, or perhaps Cassandra Wilson smiling prettily next to a
luxurious Coach handbag.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have guessed that music once identified with the
demimonde of smoky bars and drug addicts would become mainstream,
capable, at least in the minds of advertisers, of selling almost
anything. Yet, for the last few years, that is exactly what has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is a great untapped resource,'' said Peter Greco, a
senior vice president and music director at the Young &AMP; Rubicam
advertising agency. ``Its freshness breaks through the clutter. We
look to legends like Miles Davis, Count Basie and John Coltrane for
classicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The changed perception of jazz may explain why so many
commercials for expensive cars, among them Cadillacs, Mercedes and
Jaguars, use the music. ``We chose Nat King Cole singing `The Very
Thought of You' because we wanted to convey the timeless quality of
Jaguar,'' said Lisa Kirschner, the senior music producer at Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather, the agency that created the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Coach sought out Ms. Wilson for much the same reason, labeling
her a ``Living Legend'' in advertisements. ``She's an innovative
and intelligent woman,'' said Reed Krakoff, the company's creative
director. ``She sets an example.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are apparently getting the message. A few years ago
Starbucks Coffee teamed up with Blue Note Records to produce two
jazz compilation CDs, for sale over the counter at the chain's
coffee shops. Each album sold more than 100,000 copies, an
impressive number for jazz recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers also like what they see as jazz's chameleonlike
quality. ``Jazz does not inherently connect with certain products,
so it can be used with just about anything,'' said Don Sebesky, who
has composed and produced music for commercials for 30 years.
``I've used it to sell everything from Reynolds Wrap to Alaska
Airlines. What's good about jazz _ compared to pop _ is that it
doesn't date. A current sound can sound passe in just a few
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers often turn to composers like Sebesky or to music
houses, companies that produce music for commercials, because the
cost of using original recordings is so high. They start at
$200,000 and can go to $2 million for a signature song by Nat
(King) Cole. In contrast, such companies charge from $50,000 to
$100,000 to create a composition in the style of one of the
masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young advertising executives have begun to find jazz cool,''
said John Silberman, the president of JFM Music, a music house.
``They come to me excited about discovering Oscar Peterson.''
</P>
<P>
   David Horowitz, the president of David Horowitz Music
Associates, sees the increased use of jazz in part as a backlash
against synthesized music in commercials, a style once preferred by
younger members of the advertising business. ``We get more and more
requests for jazz from younger creative groups,'' he said. ``In the
past, only the older ranks, the people over 50, asked for jazz.
This may have something to do with the resurgence of jazz clubs.
The music has become much more visible in the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   To determine who listens to jazz, Blue Note hired the
Convergence Group, a New York company that specializes in music
promotion. It found that the audience was racially diverse, made up
of 35- to 49-year-old college graduates who earned at least $75,000
a year. Some 40 percent of those surveyed said they owned or
planned to buy a luxury car or sport utility vehicle within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And why does jazz attract this crowd? ``Bottom line, jazz has
integrity,'' said Eric Korte, the music director at the advertising
agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. ``It's never corny. It moves. And its
percussive quality, its energy, livens up anything connected with
it.''

COMMENTARY: NO U TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Swiss banks' stonewall has collapsed. The German industrial
giants that exploited slave labor during the war, from Volkswagen
to Krupp, are in the crosshairs of class-action suits from
Holocaust survivors. In Washington this week 44 nations are
represented in a marathon conference co-hosted by the State
Department and the Holocaust Memorial Museum to speed the further
restitution of Nazi loot, from gold to art.
</P>
<P>
   For all this activity, there's been one smaller but not
insignificant piece of the story that has received far less
scrutiny than the malevolence of the Germans, the Swiss, the
French, et al. _ namely, any collaboration between American
corporations and the Nazis. Monday, just as delegates were arriving
in Washington for their Holocaust conference, that silence was
broken by Michael Dobbs, the Washington Post reporter who last
rattled the capital with his revelation of Madeleine Albright's
previously unknown Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page investigative story, Dobbs raised new questions
about Ford's and General Motors' longtime contention that they bear
no responsibility for the large role their Nazi-confiscated German
subsidiaries played in manufacturing planes and trucks for the Nazi
war machine. Almost as disturbing as the charges themselves is the
difficulty the reporter had in getting straightforward information
from the American companies at issue. While Ford at least responded
to some of Dobbs' specific questions _ even as it denied him access
to its own team of archivists and historians assembling a new
public accounting of its wartime past _ GM behaved much like the
stonewalling Swiss banks. It made no effort to find or produce
relevant records, issued a blanket denial of any wrongdoing and
referred Dobbs (and me) back to its defense against similar charges
in a congressional hearing 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I read GM's latest statement of denial to Bradford Snell, a
historian who is completing a book on the auto giant to be
published by Knopf, he laughed and dismissed it as ``baloney.''
Snell maintains that GM's complicity with the Nazis was ``pretty
deep'' _ and far more important than that of Switzerland. In his
book he will devote ``several hundred pages'' to GM's wartime
history _ a story he has assembled over 20 years through interviews
with former GM employees and Albert Speer as well as from documents
in Nazi, British, Polish and U.S. archives. GM, though, has given
him ``zero'' information to help set the half-century-old record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   That General Motors clearly feels it can dodge a historical
reckoning is not only arrogant but perhaps reflective of a general
American resistance to airing our own dirty laundry of the
Holocaust era, even at this late date. The Anti-Defamation League's
Abraham Foxman points out that most Americans are still unaware of
the 1992 expose (by the author Linda Hunt) of Operation Paperclip,
a postwar U.S. intelligence operation that gave thousands of Nazi
scientists and family members safe harbor in America by expunging
war crimes from their records. In his new biography of Charles
Lindbergh, that otherwise excellent writer A. Scott Berg at times
toys with sanitizing the all-American hero's anti-Semitism by
tossing in bizarrely off-key everyone-did-it disclaimers (``The
Lindberghs were hardly alone in being swayed by Hitler's
magnetism''). While Henry Ford, like Lindbergh, received a medal
from the Nazis, Ron Rosenbaum is all too accurate in his recent
book ``Explaining Hitler'' when he observes that ``it's remarkable
how easily _ or conveniently _ Ford's contribution to Hitler's
success has been lost to memory in America.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading Dobbs' article in The Post, the ADL's Foxman
observed, ``Just as Switzerland finally realized that the time had
come to present the facts, regardless of how ugly they were, the
time has also come for GM and Ford to make available all their
records.'' He noted that while the current leaders of these
companies are not culpable for the ``omissions and commissions'' of
their predecessors, we still ``need to establish the whole truth,
no matter how unsavory and painful it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   We need to, but will we? It may be easier to direct our moral
outrage at the bankers of Zurich than at a corporation as American
as a Buick, as close by as Detroit.

 &HT;    Miami adopts gay rights rule
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With hundreds of impassioned partisans chanting, singing
and praying just outside, Miami-Dade County leaders Tuesday
narrowly approved extending their anti-discrimination ordinance to
include gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery debate climaxed an intense campaign that cut across
the normal political dividing lines in this often-contentious
multicultural melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged mothers fearful of the values being passed to their
children, proud mothers of gay sons, thunderous black ministers,
rabbis, gay activists and Scripture-quoting evangelical Christians
all spoke passionately, many invoking their most deeply held
beliefs and fears about the direction of modern American society.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, commissioners approved the measure by a 7-6 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message this sends is that everybody is welcome in
Miami-Dade County,'' said George Mursuli, who led the drive for the
measure. ``I really didn't know how it was going to turn out. My
knees buckled.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents promised to fight on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over,'' said Josh Morales of the Christian Coalition.
``We've got a lot of options, including a referendum or possibly
recalling some of the commissioners. It's a sad day for the county
when we allow a minority to claim special rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes as the debate over gay rights is cropping up in
communities across the country. Similar measures have appeared on
the ballot in numerous states and cities, with differing results.
</P>
<P>
   Dade County was one of the first local governments to pass such
an ordinance back in the 1970s. But that law prompted a stormy
repeal campaign led by former beauty queen Anita Bryant, who drew
national attention to the issue. She won the measure's repeal in
1977, but became a lightning rod on the controversial issue and
subsequently lost a long-held endorsement contract for Florida
orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The issue lay dormant in Miami for years, even as surrounding
governments in Palm Beach, Broward and Monroe counties banned
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum began to build again in Dade in the 1990s, though, as
Miami Beach went through a stunning rebirth, much of it fueled by
gays who refurbished run-down hotels, attracting artists and the
fashion industry. Miami Beach passed its own anti-discrimination
ordinance in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign spread to the county government this year, as
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Katy Sorenson _ whose brother is gay _ agreed to
sponsor the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote showed the intensity of feelings on both sides.
Several hundred people gathered on the plaza outside County Hall,
rallying for hours as designated leaders went inside to give
impassioned pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Christians argued the measure was a violation of Scripture and
would further erode the country's moral foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't back down on this,'' said Rev. Bill Baggett, a
Baptist minister from South Dade. ``It impacts our lives. For you
to tell me I have to employ someone or rent a house to someone in
violation of my personal beliefs is wrong. We're talking about
people choosing a lifestyle and then forcing me to swallow their
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue split Hispanics, with several Latin ministers and lay
people arguing on both sides. Significantly, the powerful Catholic
archbishop of Miami, John C. Favarola, reached a public agreement
with gay activists to take no position on the matter. Under
questioning from commissioners, a spokesman for the Archdiocese
said the body opposes all discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Other Latin clergy were vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,'' said the Rev.
Elizer Veguilla, a member of the Dade Baptist Alliance. ``It's
against the laws of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Also badly split were African-Americans. Many were outraged that
gay activists liken their struggle to the civil rights movement,
saying gays choose their lifestyle while blacks have no choice in
the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words cannot express the offense I feel as a black man when
told that,'' said the Rev. Richard Ledgister of the Sierra Norwood
Calvary Baptist Church in Miami. ``Don't talk about human rights to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the local branches of the NAACP and the Urban League
supported the measure, along with several other prominent black
leaders. In the end, Commission Chairwoman Gwen Margolis, who voted
in favor, told opponents that they should cool their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' Margolis asked. ``Monroe, Broward and
Palm Beach have all passed these ordinances and nobody is moving
away because of it. Are the Christians in those communities unable
to practice their religion because of it?''

 &HT;    Violation of campaign finance laws costs carpet company $1
millionBy Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Ga. _ The world's largest privately held carpet company
was fined $1 million Tuesday for violating federal campaign finance
laws by funneling $36,000 in corporate contributions to the failed
presidential bid of former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu of America Inc. pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor
counts of making illegal contributions. The fine is one of the
largest ever for such a violation.
</P>
<P>
   The company is headed by Republican power broker and Dalton, Ga.
civic leader Carl Bouckaert, who transformed Beaulieu from an
industry upstart to a 7,000-employee company. Beaulieu is one of
three huge carpet makers in Dalton, where about one-third of the
world's carpet is produced. The industry drives the region's
economy and wields considerable influence in north Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bouckaert's enthusiasm for GOP politics that apparently
landed Beaulieu in hot water with federal investigators. Bouckaert,
who was not charged individually, was required by the plea
agreement to attend the court proceeding. Another requirement is
that Beaulieu's corporate officers perform 500 hours of community
service, 200 hours by Bouckaert himself. Bouckaert has begun
working at a homeless shelter, said Anthony Cochran, his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bouckaert was a member of Alexander's national finance
committee. According to court documents, Bouckaert was host for a
March 8, 1995, fund-raising dinner for Alexander's 1996 campaign.
At the direction of unspecified corporate officers, at least 36
Beaulieu employees or spouses contributed $1,000 each to the
Alexander for President Committee to buy tickets to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu reimbursed the employees, disguising it in company's
records as ``bonuses'' or ``expense reimbursements.''
</P>
<P>
   Because corporations can give no more than $2,000 annually to a
federal campaign, the $36,000 contribution by Beaulieu was illegal.
Only a handful of companies have paid larger fines. The largest _
$8 million _ was paid last year by a Pennsylvania landfill company.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said there was ``an
absence of any evidence of corrupt motive'' behind Beaulieu's
illegal contributions and that the Alexander campaign unwittingly
accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   A world-class equestrian rider, Bouckaert is friends with George
and Barbara Bush and his company will carpet Bush's presidential
library. The Belgium native is South Fulton's largest individual
land owner, with more than 8,000 acres. Two years ago, he spent
$32,500 to outbid heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield for
the last of the promotional T-shirts counting down days until the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very, very sorry that this has happened,'' Bouckaert
told U.S. District Judge Harold Murphy. `` I guarantee to you that
this will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy put Beaulieu on probation until Dec. 31, 2000, after the
next presidential election.

 &HT;    Primate center to pay fine for safety lapses
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie and Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Emory University primate center has agreed to pay a
$66,400 fine for worker-safety lapses in the wake of a research
assistant's death last year .
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement reached Tuesday with the Yerkes Regional Primate
Research Center, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration agreed to drop a charge that the facility
``willfully violated safety practices.'' OSHA had initially
proposed fining Yerkes $105,300 for 10 infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth R. Griffin, a 22-year-old research assistant, died
Dec. 10 of complications from herpes B, contracted from an infected
monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yerkes officials said the ``willful violation'' citation was
dropped, and the fine lowered, because ``OSHA recognized that the
safety conditions and practices at the Yerkes Center in no way
caused or contributed to the injury or death of any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   An OSHA spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on why the
charge was eliminated until the settlement was made final by an
administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
   The citations involve only incidents that occurred after
Griffin's death, which came six weeks after she was splashed by
bodily fluids from a monkey infected with herpes B.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Jeffress, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said
Tuesday the settlement is fair. ``The proposed settlement upholds
the principle that research laboratories must protect their
employees from contact with animal fluids,'' he said, ``and
requires Emory University to pay a significant penalty for failing
to have appropriate safeguards in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yerkes contested the original OSHA citations, saying it had
followed all standard safety guidelines known at the time, and that
it properly informed and trained its employees for the risks of
working with the research monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the exposure, we were working under the
guidelines as we had since 1987,'' said Thomas Gordon, Yerkes
associate director. ``We took the guidelines very seriously and we
followed them scrupulously. Those guidelines did not require eye
protection for the activity the employee was doing at the time. It
was a low-risk activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Griffin's death, eye protection is now required any time a
person is working or in the same room with a primate.

MUSICALLY, THE TWAIN MEET, IN VIETNAM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Jamie James is a music and art critic and travel writer who spends
much of his time in Southeast Asia.)  
 (af)  
 By JAMIE JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ The twain met here last month, when the Orpheus
Chamber Orchestra, the conductorless ensemble from New York,
performed at the Hanoi Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus, which plays on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, was the
first professional American orchestra to appear in this country
since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. The two sold-out concerts were
glittering affairs, attended by culture-starved expatriates and
curious Vietnamese, turned out in their dressiest Western-style
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the revered former commander of the
Vietnamese army, who led his forces to victory over both France and
the United States-backed regime in Saigon, was in the first
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was an emotional experience for the orchestra, several
of whose male members still remember the numbers they drew in the
draft lottery. The orchestra's founder and president, Julian Fifer,
was a prominent member of the student protest movement in the early
1970s, as an undergraduate at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the orchestra arrived, Fifer and I had
breakfast, before doing some sightseeing and visiting the national
conservatory of music. I tried to explain to him the remarkable
transformation that had taken place here since my first visit, 10
years ago. Rip Van Winkle was more on top of things than I was.
</P>
<P>
   When I first visited Vietnam, in 1988, Hanoi was one of the most
isolated capitals in the world, quiet except for the whir of
bicycles and only intermittently electrified. I was tagging along
on a joint American and Vietnamese archeological expedition in a
remote western province.
</P>
<P>
   I had brought along some music cassettes to beguile the evening
hours, running the gamut from Renaissance choral music to rock.
When I played some of them for my Vietnamese friends, their
befuddled reactions suggested that musically, at least, East was
East, and West was definitely West.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam at that time adhered to a strict Socialist ideology and
was anything but welcoming to visitors from non-Communist
countries. The government has since initiated a policy called ``doi
moi,'' or ``open door,'' and Western influences are now apparent
everywhere. The streets are clogged with cars and noisy
motorcycles, and the neon signs of nightclubs and even massage
parlors light up the night.
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol of its new cosmopolitan outlook, the Vietnamese
government last year splendidly refurbished the Hanoi Opera House,
a scaled-down version of the Palais Garnier in Paris, built by the
French during colonial times. On my first visit, it was a moldering
ruin, home to a flea market sheltered under tents, to keep out the
falling plaster.
</P>
<P>
   The posh hotel in which we were now having breakfast, I told
Fifer, had been known as the Kingdom of the Rats. My archeologist
buddies and I used to sit in the bar, drinking lemonade and Russian
vodka with East German electricians and a shady Iraqi ``diplomat''
and watch the rodents cavort.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the hotel is run by a French firm, which has restored its
chic colonial-era name, the Metropole; it serves a perfect
croissant and cafe au lait.
</P>
<P>
   Performing in Vietnam, Fifer said, was ``the realization of a
lifelong dream.'' Before organizing Orpheus in 1972, he had formed
a group called Music for Peace, to raise money for antiwar
activities. He was also involved with the Movement for a New
Congress, which worked on behalf of congressional candidates
opposed to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   He showed me a story about that group in a 1970 issue of Time
magazine, which described him as ``a gentle, soft-spoken
19-year-old cellist.'' A photograph showed him grinning, with a
bushy head of hair and a cello case leaning against an American
flag with the peace symbol instead of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Fifer's youthful idealism helped shape Orpheus. The traditional
symphony orchestra, presided over by an autocratic conductor,
seemed to him the musical equivalent of the military-industrial
complex, and he was determined to create an ensemble in which the
members had the equality and freedom of expression enjoyed by the
players in a chamber group.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, an experimental
musical collective in which all the players were equal, at least in
theory. The ensemble has never even had a permanent concertmaster,
yet it has evolved into one of the most successful chamber
orchestras in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, Fifer and I toured the city by cyclo, the
pedal-powered rickshaw that used to be the only way of getting
around. Then we picked up the Orpheus timpanist, Jonathan Haas, and
went to the Hanoi National Conservatory of Music. The school
occupies three boxy concrete buildings, more cheerful than most
state architecture in Hanoi. They are ranged around a paved
courtyard. The students politely tried not to stare as we made our
way to the reception hall.
</P>
<P>
   There we were hospitably received by the rector, Tran Thu Ha, a
woman of middle age who began every sentence with a giggle, and the
vice rector, a violinist named Ngo Van Thanh. Another man gave us
his card, which identified him as ``Excellent Artist, Luu Quang
Minh,'' the dean of accordion, guitar and jazz. ``You knew he had
to be the jazz guy,'' Haas whispered as we sat down to tea and
oranges. ``He's the one wearing cool-looking clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, Ms. Ha explained the functioning of the
conservatory, which was founded in 1956. Its purposes include
scientific research and preservation of the traditional music of
Vietnam. The school's 1,000 students, ranging from primary-school
children to professionals in their mid-20s, come from every
province in the country and live in dormitories on campus.
</P>
<P>
   There are two professional orchestras in Vietnam, that of the
conservatory and the Vietnamese National Symphony Orchestra, though
they share many of the same players. Last April, Thanh said, the
conservatory orchestra toured the country, playing works by Brahms,
Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn and two contemporary Vietnamese composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three different kinds of works by Vietnamese
composers,'' he explained, ``symphonic works in the Western style,
pieces written for traditional instruments, and a new, experimental
style, very popular now, which uses some Western and some
Vietnamese instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal living composers, he said, were Dam Linh, Nguyen
Van Nam and Da Hong Quan. Haas asked whether we could see some of
their scores. As so often happens in Asia, our hosts said, ``Yes,
of course,'' but never actually produced them.
</P>
<P>
   Minh briefly described the conservatory's jazz program, which
was established seven years ago. ``We're basing it on the German
conservatory system,'' he said. ``All the students have to learn
classical music first, then they can go into jazz or traditional
Vietnamese folk music.'' His own interest he said, was in
developing a jazz-folk fusion using his instrument, the accordion.
</P>
<P>
   We dropped in on a rehearsal of a traditional orchestra. A
teacher sternly beat time with a pencil on her wooden desk. The
ensemble comprised bowed, plucked and struck string instruments and
an assortment of tuned bamboo percussion. The melody was carried by
the tieng dan bau, a small monochord that produces a haunting sound
with harmonic overtones, subtly modulated by a vibrato bar.
</P>
<P>
   The boy playing it was a beginner; two women hovered over him,
softly singing the words of the melody as they corrected his
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, a wind quintet was waiting for us. They had
prepared Ibert's ``Trois Pieces Breves,'' which they played with
impressive polish and insouciant, idiomatic style. We applauded at
the end of the performance, and the indefatigable Haas asked
whether they knew any chamber works by Vietnamese composers. Yes,
they said, a bassoon instructor at the conservatory had composed a
piece for the same instruments. But a desultory search failed to
turn up the sheet music. They played a piece by Hindemith instead.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Orpheus visit, the Vietnamese proved more
interested in demonstrating their proficiency in Western music than
in responding to requests for Vietnamese music. On his last day in
Hanoi, Haas returned to the conservatory to see its collection of
traditional percussion instruments, but _ surprise! _ the key to
the room couldn't be found. Undeterred, he found his way to a drum
factory on the outskirts of the city, where he bought a complete
set, made with water-buffalo skins.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Haas collected 60 instruments, weighing more than
600 pounds, in Vietnam. ``I think I should be in some sort of
12-step program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the musicians at the conservatory could not afford
tickets for the concerts, which cost up to $30 apiece, Orpheus
invited them to an open rehearsal. The concerts themselves were a
great success, but for the Orpheus players, the most moving aspect
of their visit to Hanoi seemed to be the connections they made with
Vietnamese musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the orchestra expressed surprise at the cordial
warmth with which they were received, given the horrors in which
their countrymen had played a part during the war.
</P>
<P>
   On an unusually cool, crisp afternoon, I sat with David Singer,
an Orpheus clarinetist, at an outdoor cafe beside Hoan Kiem Lake,
in the heart of the city. He surveyed the scene with satisfaction,
gazing at a pagoda in the middle of the lake, and pronounced Hanoi
``the most beautiful city in Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all the members of the orchestra with whom I spoke, Singer
said that the visit to Vietnam was the high point of the ensemble's
eight-country tour of the region. We briefly exchanged memories of
the Vietnam War era (he had a low lottery number, mine was high),
and a wistful look crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend in the band in high school,'' he said. ``His
name was Bruce Teague. In 1968, he came over here to fight and
never came back. Now I get to come here and play.''

IMPEACHMENT PANEL TO PROBE CLINTON FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment inquiry, wracked by escalating
partisan strife, veered toward a new frontier Tuesday as the House
Judiciary Committee, over the White House's vehement protests,
issued subpoenas to probe President Clinton's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Exposing Clinton to possible further jeopardy in the impeachment
case, the committee voted, 20-15, along party lines to pursue a
confidential Justice Department report that FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh has testified, according to Representative Bill McCollum, a
Florida Republican and senior committee member, ``may point to
illegal actions on the part of President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt move, less than 10 days before the panel is
tentatively scheduled to vote on proposed articles of impeachment,
ignited a political firestorm that overshadowed a nine-hour hearing
on the consequences of perjury and set back an effort to resolve
the inquiry short of trying to oust Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said they expect Freeh and Charles LaBella, a
former Justice Department prosecutor who wrote the confidential
report, to comply with subpoenas this week to be questioned
privately about Clinton's fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the panel's GOP majority also are seeking a federal
judge's consent to obtain LaBella's report, which contains secret
grand-jury information involving an ongoing criminal investigation
into 1996 campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last desperate grasp of a group of people who are
determined to impeach the president and haven't yet been able to
put it together,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat and senior committee member.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart assailed the expanded
inquiry as a sign the panel ``has been hijacked by extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fraying relations between Clinton's allies and the
Republican majority on the committee, the panel's chairman, Henry
J. Hyde, accused Democratic lawmakers of trying to ``browbeat''
him, angrily clashed with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz,
and vigorously defended the expanded investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not exercising or participating in a wild goose
chase,'' Hyde said. ``We are trying to find some things, and we
have good reason to believe they may be there.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hyde's request, the committee approved subpoenas for
LaBella's report and a memorandum by Freeh, which both recommended
that Attorney General Janet Reno seek an independent counsel to
investigate White House fund-raising abuses. Two additional
subpoenas were issued for memos by Reno aides analyzing LaBella's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Reno rejected LaBella's recommendation for an independent
counsel, although the campaign-finance investigation continues and
Reno faces a Monday deadline to decide if she should seek the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde dropped plans to subpoena Clinton and Reno to turn over the
LaBella document.
</P>
<P>
   But the Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed evidence the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, gathered in his
investigation of John Huang, a former Democratic fund-raiser who
also is a key figure in the Justice Department's campaign-finance
inquiry. Starr has examined whether Huang or his former employer,
the Riady family of Indonesia, paid Clinton's friend, Webster L.
Hubbell, not to testify about Clinton's role in the Whitewater
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hyde said he does not expect the impeachment inquiry's new
direction to alter his plan to complete the proceedings before
Christmas week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several committee Republicans downplayed the possibility
that the new subpoenas will yield evidence that would warrant a
lengthy investigation of Clinton's fund-raising activities. The
allegations already have been examined by two other committees _
one in the House, the other in the Senate _ without leading to
formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe this is just a matter of making sure we have
tied up all the loose ends,'' said Representative Charles T.
Canady, a Florida Republican who is one of Clinton's harshest
critics on the committee. ``When all is said and done, I believe
our focus will remain on the referral'' from Starr about Clinton's
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were not appeased. Representative Charles E. Schumer
of New York charged committee Republicans with ``hurtling headlong
into constitutional crisis, which the American people, in their
wisdom, have begged us to rein in and reject.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri,
said ``chaos is reigning'' in the impeachment investigation. He
sent letters asking the speaker-elect, Robert L. Livingston of
Louisiana, and the lame-duck speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, to
step in and ensure that the proceedings do not ``needlessly plague
the next Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts
Democrat, formally notified Hyde that he plans to offer a
resolution next week ``condemning the president's conduct and
censuring him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hyde, Delahunt described ``a formal rebuke as the
best means of bringing to a proper conclusion this unfortunate
chapter in the life of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hyde told reporters Tuesday that he would consider a
censure resolution ``non-germane'' to the committee's action. As a
result, Democratic leaders may need to strike a deal with
Livingston to bring such a resolution to a vote in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no indication that the GOP leadership was open to
a compromise resolution. In fact, a Republican source said House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, an ardent proponent of Clinton's
impeachment, has been actively trying to sway GOP members to
support sending the case to the Senate for an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   As partisan hostilities rose Tuesday, Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters outside the
hearing room that the impeachment proceedings had turned into a
``circus'' and questioned why the vast majority of committee
Republicans opposed his bill earlier this year to overhaul the
campaign finance system if they cared so deeply about fund-raising
abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan also said he doubted the Justice Department will turn
over the LaBella document to the committee. ``The last thing any
prosecutor with any sense would do is release grand-jury material
to these turkeys,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The day-long hearing began with testimony by two women who were
convicted of lying under oath in civil depositions in lawsuits
involving sex, as Clinton is alleged to have done. Both women said
Clinton should be held to the same standard they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a president is not a king, he or she must abide by the
same laws as the rest of us,'' said Barbara Battalino, a former
Veterans Administration psychiatrist who lied in a sexual
harassment case filed against her by a VA patient.
</P>
<P>
   Battalino is serving six months of court-ordered home detention
for obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also heard testimony from several judges and legal
scholars, nearly all of whom said Clinton should be censured for
his misdeeds rather than removed from office. The witnesses
supporting censure included former US Attorney General Eliot L.
Richardson and two Harvard professors: Alan Dershowitz and A. Leon
Higginbotham Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz engaged in angry exchanges both with Hyde and
Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who is considered the
panel's leading Clinton foe.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Hyde, Dershowitz accused the commmittee of
``trivializing the rule of law'' by focusing on Clinton's sexual
affair. And he called the proceedings ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagging his finger at Dershowitz, Hyde replied: ``I don't thank
you for criticizing the motives, saying that we're out to get the
president. You haven't the slightest idea of the agony that many of
us go through over this question.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the best jazz records of 1998 dares you, at
first glance and listen, to take it seriously. Sold in stores at a
budget price, alto saxophonist Greg Osby's ``Banned in New York''
is a live recording with one original tune and a few standards, and
aside from a little professional editing, it was made for about $7.
The music was captured on a small minidisk recorder over the course
of a few nights last winter at Sweet Basil, a Manhattan club, with
a single microphone placed in front of the stage. As you might
expect, the drums sound a little too loud, the piano a little too
soft.
</P>
<P>
   But the modest surface of this album _ which would be considered
a bootleg if it weren't released on a major record label _ hides a
brash subtext. Osby seems to be making two points: one, that his
music is so changeable and electrifying that it deserves to be
bootlegged and studied, as Charlie Parker's was; two, that a great
band doesn't need the special-guests padding and lumbering concepts
about classic repertory that dull the edges of so many jazz
recordings. He's right on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Osby, 38, wears sunglasses on the bandstand and comes across as
cool, a bit detached. But one afternoon, talking about his new
album and his discontent with the jazz business, from record
production to advertising to nightclubs to critics, he seemed
vigorous. Sitting in the conference room of his record label, Blue
Note, he was dressed crisply and bristled with contrarian defiance,
his manner direct and his expression challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, he had been sifting through the Dean
Benedetti recordings with a friend, the saxophonist Steve Coleman.
Benedetti was be-bop's recording angel, who collected Charlie
Parker solos on his portable tape recorder; Mosaic records issued
the complete hoard on CD in the early '90s. ``We'd analyze them,
rewind, go over certain passages and break them down to the atom,''
Osby recalled. He regularly makes similar recordings of his own
band's performances, and having played back a couple of especially
good sets, he decided that a raw recording could be ideal for
communicating the spontaneity of his band. (Osby's band will next
perform at Sweet Basil from Jan. 26-31.)
</P>
<P>
   Osby has been criticized for the mathematical quality of his
music, for the ambiguity in the rhythmic and melodic material of
his lines; they can feel as if they're constructed of thin metal
rods rather than the stretchy, billowy stuff of most jazz saxophone
playing. But those who get their information about jazz solely from
records may not know that in performance Osby is a high-speed
improviser of idiosyncrasy and authority in charge of a blow-torch
band. His playing bears a formal precision from studying be-bop,
and though he spent the 1980s working in bands led by jazz heroes
in and out of the mainstream like Dizzy Gillespie, McCoy Tyner,
Andrew Hill and Jack DeJohnette, he plays like someone who has
thought at length about how not to sound like his peers. Typically,
he stresses the weak beats of a rhythm, pumps lots of fast notes
into a ballad or takes comfortable melodic shapes and inverts them.
He sometimes sounds as if he's playing jazz backward.
</P>
<P>
   His live sets are among the most rewarding experiences in jazz
clubs at the moment. Accurately represented on ``Banned in New
York,'' the performances never follow a predetermined set list.. He
uses a cuing system, in which a short signal from his horn impels
the band to move between complete tunes like Duke Ellington's ``I
Didn't Know About You'' or Sonny Rollins' ``Pent-Up House'' and the
tiny melodic ideas he calls ``germs.'' In this practice Osby is
obviously indebted to Miles Davis' 1960s band but also, as he
explained, to hip-hop disk jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hip-hop mix-show will go nonstop for an hour or so, mixing
recordings together,'' he said. ``As one tune is dying out, another
is fading in. So at one point you hear this nebula, a floating
zone, where there are two tunes going on at once. Now I want to
take it further and make up tunes on the spot with cues, take
fragments from certain songs and make compounds out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to be inside two different pieces of music at the same
time characterizes his general philosophy. When he was growing up
in St. Louis, Osby's mother worked for an LP distribution company;
he had a large record collection as a child, and proudly remembers
stacking Cream's power psychedelia on top of Sonny Stitt be-bop
records on the family turntable. Touring the Midwest from the age
of 15, all his early jobs were in soul bands, and he talks often
about using whatever your experience has been, about the need for
recombining different approaches _ not as pastiche but as a method
to increase your own originality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to live my life as a fence straddler,'' he said. ``I
want to go across borders and borrow tendencies and textures from
other perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   And he pursues young sidemen to straddle the fence with him,
writing exacting music for them and encouraging them to bring their
own styles to the band. ``He really trains you,'' said Rodney
Green, his 19-year-old drummer. ``Most other band leaders write
drum music that you can ignore; it's just a map. But Osby was the
first cat I met whose music was _ accurate. If he wrote `rim,' he
meant rim. If he wrote `bell of the cymbal,' he meant something
intricate. You can imagine how any other gig I do is super-easy
now.'' (At a recording session earlier this year, Osby made Green
go over the placing of a single grace note on the high-hat cymbal
through more than a dozen takes.)
</P>
<P>
   Osby hired his pianist, Jason Moran, on a recommendation,
without having heard him, inviting him to join the group in the
middle of a tour. He hired Green without an audition. ``I'd heard
some of his music, but I didn't really know who he was,'' Green
said. ``And I think he actually liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'80s, Osby was central to the loose aggregation of
New York musicians called M-Base, a group that sought new musical
and business paradigms for jazz. They put out their music on
independent record labels, exploring funk, polyrhythms and new
methods of collective improvisation. Seeking to establish his own
name apart from the collective, Osby went deeper into maverick
status. In 1993 he decided to make a full-scale jazz-rap album,
``3-D Life Styles,'' and even hired one of Public Enemy's producers
to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a true `fusion' record _ my boys meet your
boys,'' he said. ``When you put together samples from unrelated
genres, you can create deep zones that are indescribable,
undefinable. Not really chords, just a zone. My challenge was to
try to improvise within that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Osby's take on hip-hop paled at the time in comparison to
the real thing _ 1993 was the year of the Wu-Tang Clan's
breakthrough debut album _ there was no question of his
seriousness; he was trying to reach the teen-ager who had never
heard jazz and might respond with curiosity to a rap about
Thelonious Monk. But it didn't sell; neither hip-hop nor jazz
listeners wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   For his 1995 follow-up, ``Black Book,'' he had learned enough
about hip-hop production to do all of it himself, including
programming beats, making samples and scratching. Since then, he
has changed his mind about hip-hop. Asked if it still has a future
with jazz, Osby doesn't hesitate. ``I'm not sure that hip-hop has a
future,'' he replied. ``It's reached the inevitable impasse of a
folk music that's not fed from any creative source.''
</P>
<P>
   That intuition was one reason he returned to making acoustic
jazz in 1996, with the record ``Art Forum,'' a small classic. As
serious as Osby's intentions had been in working with hip-hop, the
static beats and limited structure of the music had held back a
remarkable compositional talent, one given to long, segmented
themes written in oddly phrased bunches of notes. The record used
slide guitar, flute, vibraphone, trombone and bass clarinet; it
alternated curious, easy-swinging original ballads with tracks
whose moods were as delicate as paper, and it set off a run of
exceptional work, including the studio album ``Zero,'' which
appeared last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The petulant title ``Banned in New York'' refers to the
logistical difficulties Osby meets in pursuing his art, even
though, it must be said, that playing two weeks each year at a
top-level New York jazz club, making an album or two a year for
Blue Note and producing records for the label (including the
forthcoming debut by Moran) isn't doing too badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult to maintain a steady working group,'' he
said. ``With every breakthrough, either one of the cats in the band
defects, or he's coaxed away, or there's a big lapse in the
gigging. I don't work that much, and I'm so backlogged. In the last
few years I've written 50 or 60 compositions, not counting the
little germs; I must have thousands of those on computer disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I call my situation an art band. Rehearsals for me are like
a lab: we'll work on motifs and cycle them until cats start
thinking that way. I tell my guys, you're not going to make your
rent with this band.'' He gets the challenging look in his face
again. ``You have to do your other whore gigs,'' he said, ``and
then you can come with me and we can propel ourselves into other
areas.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way the Judiciary Committee billboarded the
day's hearing _ ``The Consequences of Perjury'' _ had the ring of
the pulpit to it, much as the sermon topic ``The Wages of Sin'' has
generated countless spiritual revivals across American history.
</P>
<P>
   Revival was most definitely the Republicans' hope, with their
attempt to impeach President Clinton still failing to win over the
American public. But instead of fire and brimstone, the Republican
majority presented two penitent miscreants _ two ordinary American
women who were convicted and seriously punished by the government
for having lied under oath about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   As the two told their tales, the impeachment inquiry, for all
the rush toward the New Year's deadline, took a poignant tangent.
The inquiry devoted its second public hearing on Tuesday to the
Republicans' effort to stoke popular concern about the president's
sex-and-mendacity scandal in the face of perjury crime and
punishment. Expert lawyers and retired military officers were
called and spoke from constitutional theory, while the women spoke
from bitter experience.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told of doing jail time and losing her career in
coaching women's basketball when she filed a libel suit and lied
about visiting a gay bar. The other, freed from home detention to
testify, sadly told of being furtively tape-recorded and
demolishing her career as a government psychiatrist in April by
lying about a single act of sex in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I could finally say `I'm guilty,''' Pam Parsons, the
former coach, told the lawmakers as she described her ``spiraling
journey through hell'' in trying to keep the truth from public
notice. ``When you're in a leadership position, no matter what it
is you must tell the truth about, you've got to search your soul
and recognize what it means if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans beamed at this and even more when her fellow felon,
Dr. Barbara Battalino, drove the point home: ``Because a president
is not a king, he or she must abide by the same laws as the rest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority Democrats shied from any hostile questioning of the two
obviously sympathetic witnesses, and Bob Inglis, R-S.C., exulted.
``You have done what nobody else has been able to do,'' he told
them. ``You have just thrown a wrench in the White House spin
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But on closer hearing, the committee excursion touched on some
of the same basic predicaments the nation has sensed in the
scandal. For _ the disgraced coach finally warned _ every team
needs a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ranked second in the nation, 7 and 0, kind of like the
economy _ doing very well,'' said Ms. Parsons to gentle laughter in
recalling how her team at the University of South Carolina suffered
its own downfall after her departure. ``I sense that one thing we
don't need right now is to not have a leader, in a world where
leadership matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's delving into the consequences of perjury took a
midday detour when the Republicans opened a second front into an
old Capitol Hill scandal topic, the wages of campaign financing.
Democrats fumed as subpoenas were voted along party lines for
confidential Justice Department memorandums that argue for an
independent counsel to look into Clinton campaign financing _a
topic that fully frustrated Republicans in two earlier
congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's justifiable that we take a look,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde,
the committee chairman, as Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., dismissed
the action as ``the wild goose chase of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last desperate gasp of a group of people who were
determined to impeach the president and haven't yet gotten their
way,'' Frank complained as the Republicans won the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury topic was also tackled by a panel of legal scholars
and retired military officers who ranged a now familiar spectrum.
``The initial wrongdoing was not criminal and did not, in contrast
to that of Richard Nixon, entail the abuse of power,'' said Elliot
Richardson, who resigned as attorney general when President Nixon
tried to thwart the Watergate inquiry. But Adm. Leon Edney, who is
retired from the Navy, said the president's leadership of the
military ``must be based on principle, not litigious double talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing room was far from filled most of the day, with
louder outcries over impeachment to be heard in the corridors and
in the offices of members openly wondering how the Congress might
resolve such a firmly unpopular issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take control of this runaway train before we go over a
cliff,'' pleaded Senator-elect Charles Schumer of New York, finally
voicing before the hearing the Hill's growing Democratic chorus
that the incoming speaker, Robert Livingston, must step into a
momentous inquiry he has assiduously avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., countered: ``I am now asking
the president of the United States to help us.'' Come forward
before the American people, Graham pleaded. ``Do what these two
ladies have done,'' he continued as the two women sat mutely, as
they had to through most of the day's partisan speechifying. As
they finally were allowed to go, Graham saluted the two as ``real
people who've suffered real consequences for something that we're
all wrestling with.''

EXXON MOBIL TO ADOPT CONTROVERSIAL ACCOUNTING METHOD

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Exxon and Mobil merge their financial ledgers, executives
plan to use an accounting method that will leave no trace of the
$50 billion premium that Exxon has agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the accounting method, known as a pooling of
interest, is not in the best interest of shareholders because it
does not hold executives accountable for their actions if the total
price they pay _ stock valued at $74 billion in Exxon's case _ is
too high.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that Exxon and Mobil are using an accounting
method usually reserved for merging companies of equal size, which
is clearly not the case here.
</P>
<P>
   And, some accounting analysts add that pooling restricts how the
new combined company can run many parts of its business. For
example, the new Exxon Mobil Corp. will not be able to sell more
than 10 percent of its assets in the next two years, even if such
sales make the best business sense, without imperiling the
accounting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And, because of the decision to use pooling accounting, Exxon
must now end its popular program of buying back its own shares.
Under the pooling rules, a company is greatly restricted in how
much of its stock it can buy back from the market _ a practice many
companies use to help maintain the price of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pooling method, the two companies simply combine their
balance sheets. And in this case, the $50 billion premium that
Exxon has offered to pay for Mobil's oilfields, refineries and
other assets, based on the value recorded on Mobil's balance sheet,
simply disappears.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies were forced to use the other accounting method
_ known as purchase accounting _ the $50 billion premium would be
added to the balance sheet by writing up the value of current
assets. And, it would then reduce future earnings because most
assets must be written off over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission must still review the oil
companies' proposed accounting method and could decide that the
merger transaction does not meet the strict requirements of
pooling.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil companies were forced to use purchase accounting,
analysts estimate that the $50 billion premium would be written off
over 20 years. The result: Exxon Mobil Corp. would have to reduce
earnings by $2.5 billion a year for the next two decades. The
annual $2.5 billion write-off would have eaten up 21 percent of the
$11.7 billion that the two companies reported in combined profits
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a pretty good hit to earnings and could affect
the landscape,'' said Jay Wilson, an oil analyst at J.P. Morgan
Securities. ``But Exxon and Mobil are quite confident they will be
able to use pooling-of-interest accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two giant accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &AMP;
Young, have reviewed the transaction, Wilson said, and have told
the oil companies that they believe pooling can be used. And Exxon
chief executive Lee Raymond said in an interview Tuesday that both
companies and their boards had looked at the accounting issue in
detail and believed that it would not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies must still overcome some significant
obstacles. Antitrust lawyers and government officials have
predicted that federal regulators, concerned by the merged oil
company's great size, could force it to sell important pieces of
its business. And if those divestitures amount to more than 25
percent of the oil companies' assets, securities regulators could
then force them to use purchase accounting.
</P>
<P>
   By using pooling accounting, Exxon is also better able to keep
away any other company that may be interested in Mobil. Robert
Willens, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, a securities and
investment banking firm, said that a recent change in the
accounting rules greatly increases the expense for any third
company that now tries to make Mobil a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Exxon and Mobil have agreed to a
special provision that would allow Exxon to purchase up to 14.9
percent of Mobil's stock if another company makes Mobil an offer,
making the deal more costly for that third company. Last year,
accounting rule makers decided that such a provision would also
stop the third party from using pooling accounting if its offer
proved successful, Willens said, which makes the provision a
powerful insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the oil companies' proposed deal, Exxon will give stock in
the new combined company to Mobil shareholders and will not pay
Mobil any cash. The all-stock deal has been structured so that
Mobil's stockholders will not owe taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If securities regulators later force the oil companies to use
purchase accounting, stockholders will still not be forced to pay
taxes, Willens said, because the tax rules are less onerous than
the accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Time may be running out for other companies that want to merge
and use pooling accounting. The nation's accounting rule makers,
concerned that the merger accounting rules are being abused, are
expected to propose new rules next year that would eliminate
pooling. Companies then would be left to use purchase accounting,
which is already the only available method in most of the rest of
the world.

EXXON-MOBIL MARRIAGE WOULD BE RECORD BREAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Exxon Corp., America's biggest oil company, said
Tuesday it would buy its No. 2 rival, Mobil Corp., for more than
$80 billion in a deal that would reassemble key parts of John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire to cope with a worldwide oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the combination would break records: In a year
of mammoth mergers, it would be the biggest of them all, topping
its closest rival, the $72 billion Citibank-Travelers deal, by as
much as $14 billion. It would create the largest publicly owned
energy company in the world, surpassing Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
and the largest publicly owned company in the world, vaulting past
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the increasing globalization, companies are looking for
big, global scale, and this certainly is big, global scale,'' said
Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter. ``It's not
just that they want to be big; they want to be big everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives with the two companies said the deal's chief
attraction was that it would allow the companies to save almost $3
billion in overlapping costs, much of it in wages. Analysts
predicted layoffs of up to 20,000 workers, or more than 15 percent
of the companies' combined work force of 123,000.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers wondered whether there was another motive for
the combination as well, the same one that drove Rockefeller to
snap up the nation's refineries and retail outlets in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries in an effort to control overproduction
that had driven down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's not so different now,'' said Eleanor Fox, a
New York University law school authority on antitrust issues. ``The
companies say there is no (antitrust) problem because there is so
much exploration'' by others, Fox said. ``But exploration wasn't a
problem'' in Rockefeller's time either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem may be in refining and retail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and others predicted that federal antitrust regulators would
scrutinize the deal for signs the combined company could use its
substantial market power to reduce competition and raise prices.
And they are likely to find such signs, since Exxon-Mobil would
have 48,500 gas stations worldwide, about one third of them in the
United States, and the capacity to produce 2.5 million barrels each
of oil and gas a day _ or more than the oil-rich nation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal will probably go through, but it will require selling
off some refineries and stations,'' said John H. Lichtblau,
chairman of the industry-financed Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there was heavy overlap between Exxon and Mobil
gas stations in the Northeast, especially, New York and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said the combined firm would retain both of its
predecessors' well-known names by calling itself Exxon Mobil Corp.,
as well as their valuable logos, the Exxon tiger and Mobil's red
Pegasus. It would operate in 100 countries, have a stock market
value of $250 billion, and annual revenues of $178 billion, based
on last year's results.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the companies said, ``This merger will
enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a
volatile world economy and in an industry that is more and more
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal came as oil prices hit a 12-year low Tuesday, a
downward spiral that most industry experts had not expected and one
that is likely to have all sorts of economic effects in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for delivery next January fell to $11.13 a barrel in
trading during the day. At its decade-high during the Persian Gulf
crisis in 1990, the price was more than $40 a barrel. The main
reason for falling prices is a worldwide glut of oil, the result of
overproduction by OPEC and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   On the postive side, analysts said, falling oil prices mean more
money in the pocket for American consumers and more maneuvering
room for Federal Reserve policymakers who have been trying to keep
the US economy growing without sparking renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, analysts said the price declines would
hurt energy-producing nations like Mexico and could spark another
round of financial crises like the one that swept Asia and damaged
stock markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who think the recent stock market rally
doesn't make sense have been looking for another shoe to drop. This
could be it,'' said Kathleen M. Camilli, chief economist for the
brokerage firm Tucker Anthony in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Falling energy prices have already set off feverish
consolidation in the oil industry. In addition to the Exxon-Mobil
deal Tuesday, France's Total SA said it would buy Belgium's
Petrofina SA for $11.8 billion to create a new European oil giant.
In August, British Petroleum agreed to buy Amoco Corp., in a deal
now valued at $55 billion, according to Securities Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Exxon and Mobil would reunite the two biggest
pieces of the Standard Oil monopoly that the US Supreme Court
ordered dismantled on antitrust grounds in 1911. And it would
extend a merger trend in industries that the government until
recently required be broken up or kept apart, especially in
telecommunications and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the stock-and-debt deal, Exxon shareholders would
own about 70 percent of the combined company with Mobil
shareholders owning the remainig 30 percent. Because the deal would
involve swapping Mobil shares for Exxon shares, it was difficult to
set an exact price on the combination. Estimates ranged from $77
billion to more than $85 billion. Securities Data, one of the
financial industry's chief record keepers, said late Tuesday that
the deal was worth $86.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, fell 3 3/8 to 71 5/8
after news of the deal. Shares of Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va.,
dropped 2 1/4 to 83 3/4, reflecting the decline in the value of the
Exxon offer.

WELL-CONNECTED DEAL-MAKER BRINGS VERDI TO NEW OPERA HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ When enthusiastic applause erupted at the final
curtain for a recent production of Verdi's ``Aida,'' the first
opera to be performed in Shanghai's sparklingly new opera house,
Bonko Chan thought that he might collapse with a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only performed three nights, but that was enough for me,''
said Chan, a freight-company executive who produced ``Aida'' in his
spare time. ``I checked into a hospital with exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing singers from Florence to pair them with dancers and
acrobats from Shanghai was a serious artistic and logistical
challenge in itself. But Chan had to add in the inevitable snafus
of a new performing-arts center, as well as countless political and
bureacratic land mines in a city where art is dominated and
sometimes even strangled by officialdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida'' was a critical success, praised by Shanghai reviewers
for its captivating singing and lavish staging. Chan said he felt
tremendous satisfaction at the realization that a Western opera
could actually be given a polished production in Shanghai. In
addition, he seemed amazed that all 1,000-plus items of scenery and
props were delivered from Italy to Shanghai in time, bringing life
to the enormous stage of a grand new theater.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, ``Aida'' provided an auspicious opening
for Shanghai's new opera house, which formally lifted its curtain
in October. The building is also an architectural success, at least
compared with the slapdash skyscrapers, dripping with heavy chrome
and tartly colored glass, that have heralded the economic boom of
recent years. With a curved roof that opens toward the sky like a
giant offering plate, the opera house has a luminous, sleek design
that seems to reflect an openness to the unimpeded flow of art and
culture over borders and time.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, openness is a concept not yet fully embraced by the
local culture czars, who still guard their authority over what the
public is allowed to see. Thus, it is too early to say whether the
opera house is a sign of a more genuinely open-minded future.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Shanghai officials are proud that they were able to
complete an illustrious new artistic landmark while their northern
rivals in Beijing remain mired in bureaucratic wrangling over the
design of their own opera house, even though planning began 40
years ago. Indeed, Shanghai's leaders are making good on their
claim to be revitalizing cultural life in China's largest city,
which has a population of 14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the opera house, on the other side of a redesigned
People's Park, sits the new Shanghai Museum, which, since it opened
in 1996, has afforded the best setting for art in China. Across
town, a new library, which opened a year later, was showcased
during President Clinton's visit here during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai officials chose a French architect, Jean-Marie
Charpentier, to design the Shanghai Grand Theater. In contrast to
Beijing officials, who are expected to insist on a Chinese
architect to design a national theater in the capital, Shanghai
officials pride themselves on being worldly and cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture does not belong to any one country,'' said Le
Shengli, the general manager of the Shanghai Grand Theater. ``It
should be international.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Le and his colleagues were willing to accept
Charpentier's design without encroaching here and there. Most
notably, the original design called for a fully transparent
exterior made of glass. Le said that he and other officials felt
that such openness was going too far, so they inserted glass panels
with a mild white gauze, which gives the exterior a dull glaze
during the daytime but lets it come alive at night, when interior
lights shine brightly to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a contemporary painting to face the main entrance,
Le and other officials narrowed the options to three well-known
Shanghai painters: Zao Wou-ki, Chen Yifei and Ding Shaoguang. ``We
chose Ding because he agreed to donate it to us,'' Le said
candidly. ``The other two insisted on being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera house cost $150 million and took four years to build.
Now that it is open, Le said, he is in contact with opera companies
around the world. A government official with no backround in the
arts, he concedes that he and his staff have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd very much like to cooperate with the Met and Lincoln
Center,'' Le said. Unfortunately, Lincoln Center had a heinously
bad experience with Shanghai's arts world this year, when Municipal
Bureau of Culture officials blocked actors in a production of ``The
Peony Pavilion,'' a classic Chinese opera, from traveling to New
York to perform at the Lincoln Center Festival in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Le said. Yet he took pains
to point out that the opera house was built by, and is operated
under the supervision of, Shanghai's Bureau of Radio, Film and
Television. He insisted that the house is not governed by the
culture bureau, whose director, Ma Bomin, took a strident role in
blocking ``The Peony Pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, other officials said, the Bureau of Culture shares
responsibility for Western opera productions at the new house. In
the official programs distributed at performances, Ms. Ma holds
equal billing with Le's boss, Ye Zhikang, who heads the Bureau of
Radio, Film and Television.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic squabbling can doom any project. Unless it is
backed by someone savvy or influential enough to navigate the
hallways of power, which in this city are particularly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chan, a flamboyant deal maker who is emerging as
Shanghai's leading impresario. (His given name, Bonko, represents
the local pronunciation of what is pronounced BAHNG-kuh in Mandarin
Chinese.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just an opera fan,'' Chan said modestly. Yet people who
have watched him in action _ schmoozing with local officials,
coaxing donations from corporate sponsors, hobnobbing with foreign
diplomats on opening night _ say he is one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else can work all sides like he can,'' said a French
diplomat who worked with Chan to bring a co-production of Gounod's
``Faust'' to Shanghai in November. ``He knows everyone, and he
knows how to work everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Chan tells the story, he was sitting around with friends
a few years ago and made a $100 bet that he could bring a
world-class opera to Shanghai. The joke was on him, he adds,
because he won the bet but spent half a million dollars pulling it
off.
</P>
<P>
   His first effort was Gounod's ``Romeo et Juliette,'' presented
in 1996 in an old 1930s theater. The performances sold out, and
Chan developed a taste for more. Although he had no previous
experience producing opera, his work as a freight executive gave
him a taste for taking on logistical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like opera, because it combines stage, vocal and orchestral
peformances,'' Chan said. ``Besides, there are a lot of logistics
to work out, and that's a real challenge.'' He has no musical
training but he listened to opera at home as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a company with a powerful state-owned parent, the
Jinjiang Group, directly controlled by the Shanghai municipal
government, Chan seems to have tremendous access to government
money, and he spends a lot of energy and time steering it toward a
cause he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai is already the financial capital of China,'' he said.
``We need something more culturally.''

GOVERNORS VIEW DISPUTED WEST BANK TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Texas Governor George W. Bush and Massachusetts
Governor Paul Cellucci chose Tuesday to view the rocky and disputed
hills of the West Bank from above the fray in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Cellucci, and the Republican governors of Utah and Montana
are on a four-day visit to Israel at the invitation of the National
Jewish Coalition, a Washington-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The governors met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and top Israeli officials, including the legendary hawk and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon served as tour guide for the four governors on the
helicopter ride, pointing out Israeli settlements on the disputed
West Bank land at issue in the tortuous peace process. He also
showed them the Israeli military ``security zones'' and valuable
aquifers in the West Bank that straddle Palestinian villages and
towns. Some 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank along with 1.5
million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Israeli and US media reports that the governors canceled
a trip to West Bank settlements because of angry protests by
Palestinian leaders, Cellucci said that the helicopter briefly
touched down Tuesday at the Maale Efraim settlement. This
infuriated Palestinian officials, who charge that the expansion of
these settlements is undermining the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Tel Aviv before leaving Israel,
Cellucci said, ``From the air, the sense you get is just how close
everything is, how important the land is because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department has called for a freeze on building of
settlements and criticized Netanyahu and Sharon's aggressive
expansion of existing settlements as ``not helpful'' to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing the media spotlight at each stop on the visit, Bush, a
likely presidential candidate, remained tight-lipped about his
opinions on the Mideast peace process and whether he would run for
president in 2000. He refused to hold any press conferences and
insisted on a news blackout, a posture that one Israeli Foreign
Ministry official called ``rather bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Bush's father, President George Bush, was
frequently at odds with the Israeli government over the issue of
expanding Jewish West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some questions about why they keep expanding the
settlements,'' said Cellucci. ``But having a chance to see their
locations, I have a better understanding for why that is happening.
They provide a buffer zone for where Israelis are living inside
Israel. They are strategic.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit also included a wreath-laying ceremony at the Yad
Vashem Holocaust Memorial and a visit to Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was struck by the economic disparity between
the Jewish settlements and Palestinian villages that were visible
from the helicopter, but the delegation did not meet with any
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it is complicated here,'' said Cellucci. ``But
I got the sense everyone is determined to keep moving toward
peace.''

GATES GIVES $100 MILLION TO CHILDREN'S VACCINE INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., and his wife, Melinda,
will announce a gift of $100 million Wednesday to speed the
delivery of vaccines against four childhood diseases to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is believed to be among the largest single private
donations for health care. It will go to a nonprofit health
organization in Seattle to find better ways to distribute recently
developed vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The donation, to be announced in New York City, comes as he is
battling antitrust charges in federal court in Washington. But
Gates said in an interview that the donation was part of his
expanding philanthropic effort, and that its timing was
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 43, is the world's wealthiest person, with an estimated
net worth of at least $60 billion. Gates, who has been criticized
for not being more generous, said he and his wife had given $2
billion to create two foundations. A spokeswoman for Gates said
$164 million had been distributed. Gates has also said he will
eventually give away about 95 percent of his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he waited to make such gifts, Gates said in the
interview: ``You can always look back and say, `Hey, I could have
sold all my Microsoft stock when I was 30 years old,' but that
would have been worth a small fraction of what it is now, and that
would have been all my philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   The donation Wednesday comes from one of his foundations, the
William H. Gates Foundation, and is being made to the Program for
Appropriate Technology in Health, or PATH, an organization based in
Seattle. The group plans to focus on four recently developed or
about to be marketed vaccines against respiratory, intestinal and
liver diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Two vaccines prevent respiratory ailments caused by the bacteria
Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib, and streptococcus
pneumoniae. The other two vaccines prevent rotavirus infection,
which causes severe diarrhea, and hepatitis B, a viral liver
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said the four diseases account for 2.5 million
childhood deaths a year, or about one-third of the childhood deaths
from infectious diseases worldwide, as estimated by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, illnesses caused by Hib bacteria, which
include ear infections and meningitis, have nearly disappeared as a
result of vaccinations that begin at 2 months. Hepatitis B vaccine
is recommended for routine infant immunization.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration this year approved an oral
vaccine against rotavirus. It is recommended for infants beginning
at the age of 6 weeks. Approval for an improved vaccine for use in
infants under 2 years against streptococcus pneumonia is expected
soon, a spokesman for Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines of this type generally must be given more than once, at
intervals, to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   None of the money will be used to buy the vaccines. Gates and
PATH officials said the money, at least in the early stages, would
be spent finding ways to make the vaccines widely available to
children in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years pharmaceutical companies have used genetic
engineering and other techniques to make more technologically
complex but more expensive vaccines. Although such vaccines usually
become widely available for children in developed countries, they
are out of reach in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Without intervention, Gates said, it might be years before
children in poor countries receive these vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PATH was founded to improve the health of women and children in
the United States and abroad. Dr. James Maynard, a PATH official,
said the organization received $750,000 from Gates' foundation in
1995 and an additional $2.1 million this year to support family
planning and related activities. PATH has developed curriculums on
birth control, infection prevention and delaying marriage and
children. Schools in Kenya and factories in Indonesia have used the
material, PATH officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site (www.rho.org) is designed to keep the staffs at
family planning clinics, particularly those with few financial
resources, current about AIDS, reproductive tract infections,
female genital mutilation and other public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   PATH has also focused on providing hepatitis B immunization and
says it has grown increasingly concerned about the cost,
distribution and other problems that developing countries face in
buying the newer vaccines, Maynard said. Donor fatigue is setting
in, he added, and there is a growing concern that in some countries
the money spent on costlier vaccines is taken from funds earmarked
for paying immunization workers and supporting health systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he became interested in the vaccine problem through
meetings that he, his wife and his father, William Gates III, who
heads the $1.8 billion William H. Gates Foundation, have held with
PATH officials and other scientists since February. PATH's official
proposal for a large-scale vaccine initiative was made in the last
60 days, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said PATH intends to improve vaccine administration in
as many as 18 countries in the next 10 years by developing
partnerships with the World Health Organization, the United Nations
Children's Fund and other international groups. Aided by the Gates
donation, PATH intends to try to lower the cost of vaccines and
maintain a steady supply of them through cooperative efforts of
pharmaceutical companies, scientists, the World Bank, WHO, Unicef
and international health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that PATH said it intended to do were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Conduct international meetings to develop agreements on the
appropriate storage conditions for and uses of vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work to convince government officials and citizens of
developing countries of the importance of providing and maintaining
vaccine supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop model immunization programs to establish the cheapest
and most efficient ways to introduce new vaccines and to prove that
they can be delivered as effectively as in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccine programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create Web sites, publications, videos and other educational
programs to speed up introduction and acceptance of new vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Explore the use of vaccines on a regional basis to combat
other conditions like Japanese B encephalitis in parts of Asia and
yellow fever in Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The four vaccines will complement six others already financed
through a global program directed at curbing diphtheria, measles,
whooping cough, polio, tetanus and tuberculosis. The program,
organized through U.N. agencies, has raised the level of protection
of the world's children to 80 percent from 5 percent in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Immunizations will allow more children to live and raise
families. The increase in population is expected to be a short-term
problem, Gates said, citing studies showing that as deaths among
children decline, people see less need to have large families.
``The two are both about improving human conditions,'' Gates said,
``and I see them as very consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife would focus their philanthropy on a
widespread distribution of the latest advances in medicine and
information technology. Last year Gates' library foundation,
Libraries Online!, gave $200 million to establish a five-year
program to bring new computers and the Internet into the nation's
public libraries.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR-ELECT SETS HOPES HIGH, PROFILE LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For months, Gray Davis was mocked as California's
slow but steady gubernatorial candidate. So it was perhaps fitting
that he made one of his first full-dress appearances as
governor-elect, at a news conference this week in the children's
department of the Los Angeles Central Library, in front of a
display copy of ``The Hare and the Tortoise.''
</P>
<P>
   But since his 20-point victory over state Attorney General Dan
Lungren a month ago, Davis has behaved more like a groundhog,
burrowing down in private and reviewing his options as he prepares
to take over from Gov. Pete Wilson in January. He surfaced at the
library on Monday only to announce his first staff appointment _
that of his education secretary, in keeping with his campaign
pledge to revitalize the state's sagging public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Davis' calm caution served him well in a campaign
that many pundits initially said he could not win, so his low
profile seems to be helping him now as he moves to step up from
lieutenant governor, put together a new administration and cope
with a flood of pent-up demands from Democrats, who have not had a
governor from their party since Edmund Brown Jr. 16 years ago, and
from state employees, most of whom have not had raises since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago the state Legislature's chief fiscal adviser said
the new governor could face a $1.2 billion shortfall in the state
budget of about $75 billion that he will be required to outline
just a week after taking office on Jan. 4, and other officials have
said the gap may be even larger. Davis, who enjoyed major support
from the state's powerful teachers' union and has plans for new
programs like $10,000 merit raises for teachers who agree to stay
in the field, sounded a cautionary note this week about any
across-the-board raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be looking at very limited'' flexibility, said
the governor-elect, who was generally careful during his campaign
not to promise much in the way of specific spending.
</P>
<P>
   State economic experts said they did not believe that the
projected shortfall, driven by higher-than-expected Medicaid costs
and a slowing in economic growth, marked any major downturn in the
California economy, which continues to outpace the nation
significantly in job growth. Instead, they said, it amounts to a
fairly routine dip that could be made up by a strong Christmas
retail season and greater-than-expected income tax receipts next
spring, by the time the real budget is put together beginning in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California is substantially stronger than the nation,
so much so that we may be the engine that is preventing a national
recession,'' said Philip Romero, Wilson's chief economist. ``Much
has been made, and quite appropriately, of California exporters'
exposure to the Asian downturn. But they're only about 40 to 50
percent of exports, and the next-largest is Europe, which is
holding strong. And a couple of mainstay industries, like
entertainment and multimedia, have remained strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, with revenue running about $2 billion ahead of
projections, pressure grew for election-year tax cuts, and the
Legislature and Wilson agreed to a vehicle-fee reduction that will
trim about $1 billion in revenue from Davis' first full fiscal year
in office, which starts on July 1. So the wary budget projections
give Davis some welcome political running room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a genius'' to know that ``surpluses are a
rare occurrence, and they should be disposed of on a one-time
basis,'' Davis said. ``In my 25 years in public service, there may
have been three or four surpluses over that entire time of any
consequence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Romero added, ``Having some reason to take some time before
making major fiscal decisions has the added advantage of being a
good idea, given that there'll be a lot of good information
available in April and May.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Davis is concentrating on education, the issue
that polls showed ranked No. 1 among voter concerns. At his news
conference this week, he broke with incoming governors' usual
practice of introducing a chief of staff or a finance director as
the first appointee and instead named former state Sen. Gary Hart,
a friend and fraternity brother from their days at Stanford
University, as his chief education adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, former chairman of the state Senate's Education Committee
and most recently co-director of the California State University
Institute for Education Reform, has long been an advocate of
class-size reduction and charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   The education secretary's post, which Wilson created in 1991 to
gain greater control over education policy, is only a quasi-Cabinet
position, since the Democratic-controlled Legislature has declined
to grant formal status to it. The school system is overseen by an
independently elected state superintendent of public instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said that whatever the title, Hart would be his chief
education policy adviser as he begins his term with a special
legislative session intended to focus on improving school
accountability, increasing teacher preparation and assuring that
every child learns to read by the end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced,'' Davis said, ``that a back-to-basics,
high-expectation approach to education will greatly enhance the
future prospects'' of California's schoolchildren.

TEXAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS CONTROVERSIAL DEATH ROW PROGRAM THAT
CONTRIBUTED TO INMATE'S ESCAPE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Texas Criminal Justice Chairman Allan
Polunsky Tuesday temporarily suspended a controversial death row
work program that contributed to last week's escape of convicted
killer Martin Gurule.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, who has been on the lam for five days, and six other
death row inmates who attempted to escape with him were members of
the work program, which granted them relatively free movement in
their prison unit.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, convicted of killing two Corpus Christi men during a
robbery, was employed as a janitor. He was the only inmate who
succeeded in escaping. The others gave up when guards began
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said death row inmates in the work program now will be
placed in administrative segregation, which means they will spend
all but a few hours a day in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky opposes the work program because, he said, it offers
privileges to undeserving inmates. But he noted that it is mandated
in the settlement of a major prison reform lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The state, he said, will review its options for modifying or
abolishing the work program in coming weeks, and a full report on
the program will be made to the criminal justice commission during
a January meeting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive
Director Wayne Scott said that after five days of unsuccessful
search, authorities will modify the way the hunt for Gurule is
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, the nearly continuous dog searches will be
replaced by sporadic searches and officers stationed on roadways
will be moved in an effort to ``confuse'' Gurule.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis will be placed on mobile patrols on area roadways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to search diligently,'' he said. ``We will
just use a different method.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said authorities believe Gurule remains within the 17,000
acres of prison property surrounding the Ellis Unit, which houses
the state's death row. But they believe he deliberately has refused
to move from his hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   By seemingly lessening the pressure, Scott said, ``We hope that
he will decide to move, make a mistake and be re-apprehended.''
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky also announced Tuesday that he will ask Gov. George W.
Bush to assign Texas Rangers and other Texas Department of Public
Safety personnel to the search, which already involves 500 officers
and dozens of search dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure the people of Texas that we will bring back
this fugitive,'' he said. ``We will bring him back dead or alive,
and there really is not any difference in my opinion which it might
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky, a San Antonio lawyer, has called for a full
investigation of last Friday's pre-dawn escape, to be conducted by
in-house and independent criminal justice experts.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Justice Commissioner Alfred M. ``Max'' Stringfellow
said the investigation ``is not a witch hunt. There will be no
scapegoat. We know we have a problem. We need to find what we can
do to correct it, whether it was unique to this unit or is
systemwide.''
</P>
<P>
   One of TDCJ's top lawyers said Tuesday that the death row work
program guidelines place security as the main concern when inmates
are selected to work in the prison's garment factory. That means
inmates with assaultive histories and those deemed escape risks are
generally excluded from being designated ``work capable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ponchai Wilkerson, one of the six inmates who attempted to
escape with Gurule, was in the work program, despite having been
involved in a 1993 escape attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that (escape attempt) was sufficiently far enough
ago they thought he had seen the light,'' the lawyer said. ``They
were wrong. What can I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson is under a death sentence for the murder of the
43-year-old jewelry store owner, a slaying that occurred at the end
of a one-month crime binge in 1990 in which Wilkerson and
accomplices shot and wounded seven people in four different
incidents. &QL;

SCIENTISTS SAY EVIDENCE LINKING BREAST IMPLANTS TO DISEASE IS
INSUFFICIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A panel of four scientists appointed by a federal court issued a
report Tuesday concluding that scientific evidence has so far
failed to show that silicone breast implants cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, experts in immunology, epidemiology, toxicology
and rheumatology, said that some of the research they reviewed was
flawed, and as a result, they could not absolutely rule out the
possibility that a link between implants and disease might one day
be established.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of the U.S. District Court in
Birmingham, Ala., who oversees breast implant lawsuits in the
federal courts, appointed the panel two years ago to provide expert
testimony that was independent of either side in the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's detailed report, several inches thick, was filed and
made public Tuesday and is available on a Web site:
(http://www.fjc.gov/BREIMLIT/mdl926.htm). Now the four scientists
will give depositions under oath about their findings, and their
testimony will be videotaped for use in federal courts where breast
implant cases have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Implant manufacturers who are defending the suits were delighted
with the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   John McGoldrick, a senior vice president and general counsel at
the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which has 6,000 cases pending
against it, called the report ``very strong'' and said it would
have ``significant impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Panel members ``have done their homework,'' he said, adding, ``I
think their conclusions are clear, and I don't think that will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sybil Goldrich, a lawyer with implants who was a founder of
an advocacy group for women with implants, criticized the panel.
She said it had focused too closely on scientific studies and had
not paid enough attention to the experiences of individual women
with implants.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology
at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans emphasized that
``nowhere does it say that implants are safe or that they don't
cause disease.'' He said that at this point there are ``still many
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel members, he said, ``very much leave open the question
as to whether these devices cause disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Implant makers concede that many women develop scar tissue or
even inflammation in their breasts after receiving implants, and
that the implants can rupture. But the litigation involves
assertions that the silicone in the implant can cause systemic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   As the litigation has gone on, settlements have been negotiated
between makers of the devices and women who say implants made them
ill. Some of the women now must choose between accepting
settlements or pursuing their cases, with the knowledge that the
courts will be relying on the report issued Tuesday. It was not
immediately clear how many plaintiffs would continue to press their
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as damaging a report from the plaintiffs' point
of view as I can imagine,'' said Michael Green, a law professor at
the University of Iowa who said he has no connection with the
implant litigation, but who studies the use of scientific evidence
in toxic substance litigation. ``If I were a plaintiffs' lawyer,
I'd be beside myself,'' he added. As a consequence of the report,
Green said, ``I think it will be hard to find a federal judge who
will permit a case to be tried or who will sustain on post trial
motions a plaintiff's claims to systemic disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Portland, Ore., who
represents about 150 women with implants, said that the report
``will make it more difficult to get to juries and more difficult
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Law experts interviewed about the report cited its blunt
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the toxicology section, written by Dr. Nancy
Kerkvliet, an immunotoxicologist at Oregon State University,
concluded that ``there is no evidence that silicone breast implants
precipitate novel immune responses or induce systemic
inflammation.''
</P>
<P>
   The immunology section, written by Dr. Betty A. Diamond of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y., concluded
that, ``women with silicone breast implants do not display a
silicone-induced systemic abnormality in the types or functions of
cells of the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   The epidemiology section, written by Dr. Barbara S. Hulka, who
is chairwoman of the epidemiology department at the University of
North Carolina in Chapel Hill, reported that even when studies were
combined and analyzed together there was ``no evidence'' of a
relationship between implants and connective tissue diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The rheumatology section, written by Dr. Peter Tugwell, who is
professor and chairman of the department of medicine at the
University of Ottowa, noted that ``breast implant patients have
reported a diversity of signs and symptoms that are also associated
with rheumatic or autoimmune diseases.'' But, Dr. Tugwell added,
``For each sign or symptom showing an association with breast
implants in a given study, other studies showed no association.''
</P>
<P>
   In his instructions to the panel, Judge Pointer asked not only
for a review of the research on implants but also for an assessment
of whether the scientists' conclusions would be subject to
challenge from other experts. In their report, the panelists noted
that while some might disagree with their findings, ``It is our
informed opinion that the large majority of scientists in our
respective disciplines would find merit in our reviews and
analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fate of lawsuits involving thousands of women could be
determined by the panel's conclusions, every effort was made to
keep its members at arms' length from the dueling parties. The cost
of the panel, about, $800,000, was borne by the Federal Judicial
Center in Washington. And neither side in the implant litigation
was allowed to contact the scientists while they weighed the
evidence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflicting evidence in the breast implant
cases,'' explained Abel Mattos, the chief of court administration
policy staff of the administrative office of the United States
courts. ``Judge Pointer's role was to try to figure out a way to
cut through all this and to get a totally objective group of
scientists who had not been involved in the fray.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal rules of evidence allow judges to appoint
experts, few have done so and none has invested so much in getting
the opinions of an independent panel, Mattos said. But, he said,
the judicial center was eager to help because it saw the implant
litigation as a perfect test case for the use of expert panels.
``The hope is that it could save potentially millions of dollars in
trial time and lawyers; time,' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The report took two years to produce, during which time the
panel members sifted through about 2000 documents submitted by the
implant makers and the lawyers representing women with implants and
questioned scientists who argued for and against the theory that
implants cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was made public Tuesday, a telephone press
conference was convened by Fenton Communications, a public
relations agency that represents women with implants.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diana Zuckerman, who is on the board of the National Women's
Health Network, an advocacy group, and did postdoctoral work in
epidemiology at Yale University, focused on the epidemiology. Dr.
Hulka, she said, ``did a good job of answering the question she was
asked, Is there evidence of disease? But that is a different
question than, Is there evidence that these women were healthy?''
And, she added, ``I think the conclusion here is we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldrich said in the press conference that the real evidence
that implants are dangerous is in the women's medical records,
which are sealed in courtrooms. ``That's where the secret is, the
secret is in these real people who have these products and not in a
bunch of esoteric studies that really don't address the things that
people need to address,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Green, the Iowa law professor, explained in a telephone
interview that to win a case, plaintiffs' lawyers have to go beyond
showing that it is possible that implants might be associated with
disease in some future studies. Instead, he said, lawyers have to
show it is more likely than not that the devices caused a
particular woman to become ill. In general, he said, courts have
looked for evidence that a person's risk of disease is doubled
because of a device or drug.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Knowles, a plaintiffs' lawyer from Atlanta who was a
participant in the Fenton press conference, said, ``we're obviously
disappointed,'' by the report. But, he said, ``we think everybody
should hold their fire,'' until he and other plaintiffs' lawyers
have a chance to question the panel members in depositions. Then,
he said, he expects to ``ask some questions that we think might
yield a different result than someone might perceive in just
reading the report.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Williams, the plaintiffs' lawyer, noted that the
biggest study yet is still under way. That study, involving 13,500
women and directed by Dr. Louise Brinton of the National Cancer
Institute, will be published early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brinton doesn't find anything, then probably that will put
an end to most of the litigation,'' Williams said. ``But, on the
other hand, if she does find something, then the tables will
turn.''

 &HT;    John Glenn still glowing after historic space mission
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Glenn said Tuesday he's ``still in the
glow'' of last month's space shuttle mission, even as the
earth-bound duties of a retiring Senator and American icon have
beset him.
</P>
<P>
   In his first meeting with Ohio reporters since he became the
oldest man in space, the 77-year-old Glenn talked with animation
and humor about his nine days in orbit; the medical exams he still
must endure to chart his body's reaction to that flight; and the
upcoming launch of the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and
Public Policy at Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said that he was back to feeling normal by the fourth day
after his Nov. 7 landing, having regained his sense of balance,
which was slow to readjust to earth's gravity. He said he now feels
no lingering ill effects of his nine days of weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that way,'' Glenn said. ``Now they're still analyzing
whether I really am that way.'' After weeks of medical tests back
on Earth, Glenn still must undergo extensive exams 30, 60, 90 and
180 days after his shuttle flight ended. Doctors want to know if
the weakening of muscle and bone, common among astronauts after
long stays in zero gravity, reverses in an elderly man like Glenn
the way it does in younger astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those test results show, Glenn seemed nearly as happy
as he was during his free-floating days aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at length about the almost church-like quality of
looking out a space shuttle window at the blue Earth set against
the blackness of space, The word ``awesome'' may be overused, he
said, but it aptly described the view he saw.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if he could have landed the shuttle himself,
Glenn _ an accomplished pilot but the lowest-ranking crew member,
who didn't touch the flight systems _ said confidently, ``Of
course!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dryly added a common boast of old-school test pilots:
``I could fly the box it came in!''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Glenn will make his first public appearance in
Washington since the shuttle flight when he attends a gala in his
honor at the National Air and Space Museum. The event, sponsored by
Ohio State University, is being billed as the kick-off for Glenn's
``next mission,'' the school's institute in his name.
</P>
<P>
   OSU President William Kirwan, who joined Glenn for Tuesday's
press conference, talked about the school's desire to create a
program of study in public service that rivals the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a center like that in the Midwest,'' Kirwan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn school will differ from the Kennedy school's
policy-heavy curriculum by focusing on developing citizenship and
community activism among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use this institute as really a catalyst to excite
our young people about public service, volunteerism,'' Kirwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Glenn school will cater to undergraduates, rather than
the graduate student programs at Kennedy. The school will seek to
establish internship programs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, policy issues will be part of the Glenn school,
especially topics that interested Glenn during his 24 years in the
Senate. For instance, the school plans a ``major conference'' next
fall to discuss the spread of weapons of mass destruction around
the globe, something Glenn made a focal point of his Senate career.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which was unveiled in October and will open in
January, is getting the Washington gala treatment to raise its
profile among heavyweight policy makers and potential corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn Institute has been added to a list of projects to be
supported by a $1 billion fund-raising campaign at OSU called
Affirm Thy Friendship. The Glenn school's $20 million start-up cost
will come from a mix of those funds as well as other OSU budget
accounts.

 &HT;    This is Fall? Miami Valley residents enjoy Indian summer
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's about the time of year when ice skates and
snow sleds probably should be going into action. But around the
Miami Valley, it's the in-line skates and golf clubs that are
getting a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 9, Dayton has had only three days when the high
temperate was less than 50 degrees, and that pattern is expected to
persist at least through Saturday when highs in the upper 50s are
predicted, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll often have an Indian summer warm spell in the fall here,
but it usually doesn't last as long as it has this year,'' said
Jeffrey Sites, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service
post in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Sites said the band of upper atmosphere winds called the jet
stream usually is perched over Ohio at this time of year. But the
jet stream currently is positioned farther north over Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``So instead of cold Canadian wind coming off the Great Lakes,
we get warmer air blowing in from the South,'' Sites said.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Kent Bobo, manager of Larch Tree Golf
operations in Madison Twp. ``We've been booked solid every day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even had to turn people away the last couple of
weekends. We're hoping this weather lasts until next April and that
then it starts to warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leiwig, director of the Greene County Recreation, Parks and
Cultural Arts Department, said people taking advantage of the warm
weather are keeping park patrols and maintenance crews busy. Greene
County has more than 50 paved miles of paved bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at summer levels, but plenty of people are out every
day on in-line skates and bicycles,'' Leiwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Snyder, president of Groby's Garden Center and Florists,
said the weather is affecting plants but that serious damage is not
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some flower bulbs have started to sprout, thinking it's
spring,'' she said. ``When it gets cold, the tops of those plants
will turn yellow, but it won't hurt them. Mother Nature will take
care of them, and they'll flower normally next spring.''
</P>
<P>
   One plant that is no longer a problem this year is ragweed,
according to Dr. Arturo Bonnin of the Allergy and Asthma Centre of
Dayton. Ragweed, a major irritant to some people, mostly died with
the first mild frost earlier this fall, Bonnin said.
</P>
<P>
   People sensitive to molds, however, still might be having a hard
time, Bonnin said. Molds grow on organic material outdoors in
moderate weather, and Bonnin said he's had lots of patients
recently complaining of allergy symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   He said outdoor molds will keep growing until hit by one or two
heavy frosts.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather is generally good news for utility bill payers.
Neil Costello, managing director of Dayton Power and Light Co.,
said electrical consumption for November was 3 percent to 5 percent
below normal. But natural gas usage, which is more sensitive to
weather-related fluctuations, was down 20 percent from the average
November.
</P>
<P>
   The warm weather has had a chilling effect on snow blower sales,
according to Heil Brothers Lawn and Garden Equipment in Kettering
and Buchanan Power Equipment Center Inc. in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually by this time, people have come in to have snow plows
attached to their tractors,'' said Gary Campbell, Buchanan's
assistant manager. ``But they're still working on their yards.
They're pulling garden carts around and cutting the grass and
chopping up the leaves one more time.

 &HT;    Weather may delay flight for Currie
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla._ Former Troy, Ohio resident Nancy
Currie has been waiting for Thursday's scheduled space shuttle
launch for more than two years, but bad weather might make her wait
a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   Currie is one of six astronauts scheduled to lift off at 3:59
a.m. Thursday in space shuttle Endeavour. Their nearly 12-day
mission: To assemble the first pieces of the International Space
Station _ the Russian-built Zarya control module already in orbit,
and the Unity connecting node in Endeavour's payload bay.
</P>
<P>
   Because Endeavour must rendezvous with another orbiting object,
its launch ``window'' _ the time in which it can lift off and get
into the right orbit _ is unusually tight. If anything delays
Thursday's launch more than 10 minutes, NASA will have to wait
until Friday morning to try again.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook Tuesday wasn't promising.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Clif Stargardt, an Air Force meteorologist who produces
forecasts for space launches, said unstable local weather is likely
to produce low cloud ceilings and showers at launch time.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers producing lightning Wednesday afternoon could
even prevent the launch team from fueling the shuttle's enormous
external tank with flammable liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite the cheery forecast we've had the last few
missions,'' Stargardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Stargardt said the forecast calls for similar weather Friday,
but is expected to improve for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Longer delays could put the shuttle launch in conflict with a
Delta rocket launch set to blast an unmanned spacecraft towards
Mars on Dec. 12, shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway said. If
Endeavour doesn't launch before Dec. 8, he said, the launch might
be rescheduled for early January.
</P>
<P>
   This mission has already been beset with delays.
</P>
<P>
   NASA named the crew members for the mission in 1996, when the
launch was scheduled for December 1997. Delays in other parts of
the space station program pushed that launch date to last July,
then September.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle itself is in good shape, launch director Bob
Sieck said. The myriad mechanical systems of the 2,250-ton rocket
are ``behaving well,'' he said. The only mechanical glitch so far
was an electronic device that drives instrument displays in the
orbiter. It was replaced and didn't affect the countdown, Sieck
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in space, Endeavour will chase down the Russian space
station module until they are about 10 feet apart. At that point,
it will be Currie's job to grab it with the shuttle's robotic arm
and position it for mating with the Unity node.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Currie said the job is especially difficult
because it will be a ``blind'' grab. Her view blocked by the Unity
node, she will depend on TV monitors and a computerized space
vision device to tell whether the 41-foot-long, 22-ton Zarya module
is in the right position for docking.
</P>
<P>
   Once positioned, Endeavour will fire its jets to shove the two
modules together.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Currie's third space flight, but it will be her
most challenging yet, she said. Besides using the shuttle's arm to
position hardware, she will be using it to move two astronauts
around on three spacewalks as they hook up dozens of cables and
mount equipment on the space station modules.
</P>
<P>
   But all of more than 30 shuttle flights scheduled for
construction of the space station will be tough, said Frank
Culbertson, space station operations manager and a former
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a shade of what's to come,'' he said.

FROM WELFARE TO WORK: HIRING EX-RECIPIENTS CAN BENEFIT SMALL
FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Beti Ward, owner of a growing air cargo company, was
looking for a motivated worker to do the kind of entry-level tasks
every business has: filing, typing and basic computer work.
</P>
<P>
   Darkina Burris, single mother of two, was looking for the kind
of job that would give her her own desk, her own computer and, more
importantly, a way out of her old neighborhood and the welfare
trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't interviewed before, so I was nervous. And she was
tough,'' Burris recalls of Chief Executive Officer Ward. But since
she was hired at Phoenix-based American International Cargo in
1996, Burris has been promoted twice _ from file clerk then to
billing supervisor now _ and is one of the shining examples of how
small businesses can take a chance and win with people once deemed
unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for workers to fill jobs as companies boom and
Arizona's unemployment rate falls to a record low, small businesses
like Ward's are turning to a riskier pool of hires _ welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the idea makes sense: Small businesses need workers;
welfare recipients are an available supply. Since 1996 welfare
reform laws took effect, federal officials have been pushing large
and small businesses to get people off the rolls and into
hard-to-fill entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   `IN A SHORTAGE'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot more requests than ever before, because
everybody is in a shortage,'' said Andrea West, executive director
of Northside Training Center in Phoenix. The non-profit center
trains and counsels about 500 people a year in hopes of matching
them with jobs at 80 mostly small companies.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, the idea is no wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Economic Security didn't track how
many of its 11,000 welfare-to-work participants were placed in
small companies last year. But Bill Hernandez, director of the
Division of Employment and Rehabilitation Services, says the agency
deals with a cross section of employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our experience that small businesses are trying it
out, but they're not a key player,'' said Janette Torres, economic
development program manager for the city of Phoenix. ``The people
require a great deal more than the average worker in terms of
benefits. Mentoring is important, and small businesses don't have
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition from bigger businesses is another reason for the
spotty record. About 200 welfare recipients in three years have
gone through a training program started by DES and the Arizona
Restaurant Association, Executive Director Joe Yuhas said. However,
``our success led to other industries jumping on board, so now
we're competing with the others for a shrinking labor pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in the pool are typically women with two children,
little or no work experience, and an average of 18 months on
welfare, Hernandez said. Contrary to stereotypes, West said, many
turned to welfare after falling on bad times, such as having a
spouse leave or being hurt on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGES
</P>
<P>
   Burris estimates she was on welfare six to 12 months, during
which time she went through a DES program that trains recipients in
basic skills like interviewing and filling out applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, frustrated with trying to attract job applicants to her
company's site near Sky Harbor International Airport, had listed
her jobs with DES' Job Service. The agency referred Burris to the
company, and it was up to her to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and others say hiring from the welfare rolls has several
advantages for small businesses:
</P>
<P>
   _They can hire at entry level, mold that person to their needs
and promote from within.
</P>
<P>
   ATC/Vancom of Arizona, which provides bus service at Sky Harbor
and for Phoenix Transit, has hired about 20 percent of its
workforce through Northside Training Center and other programs,
said Wil (CORRECT) Jackson, assistant general manager of
operations. It seeks people with positive attitudes and common
sense who are willing to learn the new skill of driving a bus, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward believes promoting from within gives her company people who
know what they're doing and who are more faithful to the firm.
Studies confirm that once welfare recipients are employed, they
tend to stay longer, Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   In Burris' case, Ward said, ``She was motivated enough to pick
things up going on around her, learn from them and assume more
responsibility. When we saw that, we started training her in other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New workers are surrounded by good examples, including owners
who know firsthand what it's like to build something from nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, as a female business owner, has become a positive role
model for Burris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get away from the negative energy and be surrounded
with positive energy,'' Burris said. ``When I went to American
International Cargo, I was surrounded with positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   _Smaller companies, often touted for their family atmosphere,
may be less intimidating than big companies filled with hundreds of
new faces and books full of rules.
</P>
<P>
   American International Cargo has 10 employees in its Phoenix
office and another 150 at its Los Angeles and Hawaii locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a huge company with 10 managers, they're busy,
busy,'' Burris said. ``Here, we can work around the corner and I
could get the attention I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   _Small companies may be more flexible regarding workers'
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who had raised three children herself while working in
real estate and as a beautician, knew what it's like to be short of
babysitting money and arrange one's workday around a sick child.
When that happened to Burris, Ward made sure the company let her
catch up by working different hours or different days.
</P>
<P>
   _Tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Though the need for dependable workers is a bigger driving
force, tax credits are available for hiring welfare recipients. The
federal government gives credits for 35 percent of the first
$10,000 of first-year wages, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 of
second-year wages. Employees must have been on welfare at least 18
months and must have been hired after Jan. 1, 1998, and before May
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of these hires are countered by a number of
disadvantages, employers and officials say. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _Uneducated or unmotivated job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Many welfare recipients have little or no work experience, or no
recent work experience, DES' Hernandez said. Other would-be workers
have below-average reading, writing or math skills that programs
like Northside's try to improve.
</P>
<P>
   _The time it takes to train these workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ward thinks training is manageable when a business hires for
entry-level positions, in which the person will be doing tasks such
as filing documents in numeric or alphabetic order.
</P>
<P>
   For more specific skills, DES contracts with community colleges
and non-profit organizations to run training programs, including
ones for restaurants, electronics assemblers and call centers.
</P>
<P>
   _The level of pay and benefits needed to keep people off
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses can't afford to pay for health care
coverage or subsidize child care, said Marie Sullivan, executive
director of Arizona Women's Education and Employment. &QL; 
`GIVE THEM A CHANCE'
</P>
<P>
   Job applicants have told Ward that by the time they paid for
child care, they would be losing money by going to work. She
replies that unlike staying home, a job gives them a chance for
advancement and a chance to better themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and other experts agree that solving transportation and
child care problems would be a big help in the effort to link
welfare recipients to small-business jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Valley's buses run at poor times, Burris is saving
to buy her own car. Until then, she often must depend on her
roommate to drive her the five miles to work.
</P>
<P>
   And though DES helped pay for child care as Burris made the
transition to work, Ward notes that the subsidies drop as workers
earn more, penalizing people who try to advance.
</P>
<P>
   An open mind, mentoring and communication also are vital to
making the welfare hire a successful one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these people without any bias or preconceived ideas,
and give them a chance,'' ATC/Vancom's Jackson said. ``Sometimes it
just takes a hand, and once they get their footing they are as good
as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward says she encouraged Burris to ask, rather than keep quiet,
when she didn't understand something. E-mail was an easy,
non-threatening tool.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship has turned into a personally satisfying one,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anyone to believe in me, and she did,'' Burris
said of Ward. ``I don't doubt myself now. I will NEVER let my
confidence go to the bottom of my feet again.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting themselves apart from their raucous
colleagues in the House, Senate Republicans left their leadership
untouched on Tuesday and approved the same crop of experienced
senators to lead them into the next elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the one contested leadership race, Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, who was the Senate Republicans' chief fund-raiser and
election strategist, fended off a challenge by Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee and a vehement opponent of overhauling the campaign
finance laws, won the race by a vote of 39 to 13, a reflection of
his fund-raising expertise and the uneasiness of many Republicans
with Hagel's relative inexperience as a first-term senator. The
position will be especially important in 2000 because Republicans
will have 19 seats to defend while only 14 Democrats are up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to McConnell, a three-term senator who had the
backing of the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, was
heralded by some, especially a small group of conservative junior
senators, as a sign of dissatisfaction with the leadership and its
election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, McConnell's years of experience and
fund-raising prowess prevailed. For the 1998 elections, McConnell's
campaign committee raised more than $77 million, slightly more than
was raised by his predecessor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Republican leadership was re-elected without
opposition: Lott; the assistant majority leader, Don Nickles of
Oklahoma; the Republican Conference chairman, Connie Mack of
Florida, and the Republican policy chairman, Larry Craig of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to introduce our leadership team here today
because it is the same leadership group we've had for Republicans
in the Senate, and I think that is news in itself,'' Lott told
reporters at a news conference after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House, where the post-election turmoil led to Rep.
Newt Gingrich's resignation as speaker, and the defeat of Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio as chairman of the Republican Conference, Lott and
his colleagues survived virtually unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was because Senate Republicans fared better in the
November elections than their House counterparts. Republicans lost
five House seats, but neither gained nor lost seats in the Senate.
The leaders' hold on their positions also reflects the chamber's
more deliberative, less stormy nature.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders faced no opposition in their re-election bids
on Tuesday, but several senators were promoted. Sen. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey will replace Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska
as chief fund-raiser. And Sen. Harry Reid, who survived a tight
race in Nevada, will take over as whip for Sen. Wendell Ford of
Kentucky, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota will remain the Democratic
leader.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the absence of challenges for the other leadership positions
in the Senate, it was the challenge to McConnell that garnered the
most attention. McConnell drew fire from a few Republican senators
who said that he had been too focused in the general election on an
effort to defeat Sen. Russell Feingold, a leading sponsor of
campaign finance legislation, at the expense of other races.
Feingold, D-Wis., was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, a telegenic decorated veteran of the Vietnam War who was
elected to the Senate in 1996, announced his challenge to McConnell
last week, speaking out against ``constant, demonizing, negative
campaigning.'' He also advocated de-emphasizing the ``soft money''
donations _ unlimited, unregulated contributions given directly to
political parties by corporations, labor unions and individuals _
that McConnell has deftly solicited.

IRAQ BEGINS ANSWERING ARMS INSPECTORS' QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a flurry of letters released Tuesday, Iraq
began answering in considerable detail some of the questions posed
by arms inspectors over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the U.N. Special Commission, which is in charge
of disarming Iraq, said they had found little new in the responses.
</P>
<P>
   The letters were apparently part of an effort to demonstrate
cooperation as chief inspector Richard Butler was leaving for talks
with the French and Russian governments, which are Iraq's strongest
supporters in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The one positive note, officials said, was an Iraqi request for
technical teams to help examine sites where a variety of weapons
had been reported destroyed or jettisoned by the Iraqis. Those
problems include shells of mustard gas and missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he had reacted with satisfaction to the requests but
recalled in a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that
he proposed the work in June and was prepared to begin in August,
when Iraq stopped inspections of new sites.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the commission, known as Unscom, say Aziz has
stopped replying directly to Butler since Iraq stepped up its
campaign to have him removed and replaced by a U.N. official.
Butler is an independent expert on arms control who was the
Australian representative at the United Nations before becoming
executive chairman of the inspection agency, which reports directly
to the Security Council, not to the U.N. bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials are hoping to demonstrate adequate cooperation
in the coming weeks to lead to a comprehensive review of relations
with the United Nations. But they missed a deadline Monday to turn
over a crucial document on chemical munitions that were used in the
war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988. The commission says it needs the
document to determine how much of which chemical agents remain to
be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated U.S. statements to the contrary, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein expects that review to lead to a lifting
of an oil embargo imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Butler would have to find that enough progress had been achieved
to recommend starting a review. Russia said recently that not
everything could be known about the remnants of the Iraqi weapons

and move on.

<P>
   Iraq is still under the threat of U.S. and British attack if it
refuses to cooperate with the inspectors, a threat that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan underlined this week when he said in
response to questions on a trip to North Africa that the Americans
did not need to return to the Security Council for authority to
take military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain are also actively courting a wide
range of Iraqi opposition groups and individuals with promises of
assistance if they are willing to work together in trying to topple
Saddam, Iraqi exiles said this week. The exile groups have been
told that there could be a change in Iraq in a month or two, an
exile leader said.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled Iraqi newspapers Tuesday published a
letter from Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to the
Security Council that asked for a meeting on ``acts of aggression
against Iraq and its sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arab diplomat, Jassim Mohammed Buallay, the representative of
Bahrain on the Security Council, takes over the rotating presidency
of the council from the United States on Tuesday. Other diplomats
are watching to see whether Iraq will be able to muster additional
support, or more of a hearing, with someone from the Persian Gulf
at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bahrain, where the special commission maintains its
regional base, has supported the United States on Iraq, it is the
only Arab country on the Security Council, and it will be expected
to reflect the views of other Arab nations, as well as its own.

 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite forensic evidence, the modern-dance pioneer
Martha Graham did not die in 1991. She can be found performing,
name dropping and introducing guest choreographers the first
Wednesday and Thursday of most months at a club in Manhattan's
meatpacking district. Oh, she also grew 16 inches and is often
mistaken for a soft-spoken, witty man named Richard Move. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martha(AT)Mother is the event, a satiric character study of
Graham as artist, diva and publicity hound _ all portrayed by the
6-foot-4-inch Move in Graham drag _ as well as a loving tribute to
modern dance and its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of serious dance and high camp was devised by
Move, 30, in collaboration with Janet Stapleton, 38, the
co-managing director at Dance Theater Workshop, New York's premier
showcase for young choreographers. Move and Ms. Stapleton wanted to
create an event that fused their shared love for both contemporary
choreography and the sweaty energy of the club scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived in both the dance world and the late-night
experimental cabaret world,'' says Move, who came to New York in
1989 after graduating from Virginia Commonwealth University with a
degree in dance. (Back then, his last name was Winberg.) He has
danced with Karole Armitage, Mark Dendy and Pooh Kaye, among
others, and created ``Jackie 60,'' a drag revue also presented at
the club Mother. ``I have an equal respect for the work that can be
done at 1 a.m. in a nightclub and something performed at the Joyce
Theater, and I don't see one as superior esthetically or more
important than the other.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With no advertising but lots of word of mouth, and very limited
seating, Martha(AT)Mother, now in its third season, has become a
hot ticket downtown. The club, at 875 Washington Street at West
14th Street, seats only 60, with room for 25 standees. A second
show has been added on Wednesdays in response to ticket demand.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov has attended, and so have the painters Brice
Marden and Francesco Clemente and legendary members of the Graham
troupe from the halcyon 1950s _ Yuriko, Bertram Ross, Matt Turney,
Mary Hinkson and Linda Hodes. Two other Graham company alumni,
Stuart Hodes and Gus Solomons Jr., have performed on the
8-by-14-foot stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing everyone learns once they've performed at Martha,''
says Move, ``is how much space they've wasted their whole
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The format is that of a variety show, with Move serving as MC
for works by contemporary choreographers. The evening opens with
Move and his troupe of three women and one man _ Reid Hutchins, a
friend since college and Playgirl magazine's 25th-anniversary
centerfold _ doing a takeoff of a Graham dance, often to the music
from the film ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement is based on Graham technique and is performed with
deadpan seriousness, which, along with some lip quivering and
glaring by Move, gives the parody bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use Reid to exemplify and personify the Graham hunk,'' Move
explains. ``The men in the troupe were painfully gorgeous and for
the most part did very little onstage and had no clothes on. They
became props for these fierce women who were doing this incredible
movement and were the stars of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a cornucopia of Martha Graham anecdotes and
pontifications, delivered by Move with deliciously exaggerated
diction, that introduce and link the subsequent dance performances.
Move has culled his material from Graham's autobiography as well as
the biographies written by Agnes DeMille and Robert Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are very moved by Martha's words, because it's
very unfashionable to be so sentimental about your art,'' Move
says. ``She equated art with religion. For a lot of dance people
who come to the shows, hearing Graham's words rekindles their early
years and memories of why they started dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy actually appeared at the November edition of
Martha(AT)Mother, giving a slide lecture about Graham's
collaborations with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. The hipster
audience was rapt. Later the same evening, it howled at the
performance artist John Kelly's sly impersonation of Pina Bausch,
the moody German choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the evening's finale, it was gasping audibly at the delicate
beauty of a stick figure manipulated by the puppeteer Basil Twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Richard's integrity,'' says Kelly, who was also
featured on the very first Martha(AT)Mother program. ``I'm really
able to appreciate the Graham choreography by seeing it through
this lens of pathos and irony, which is what travestie does. The
energy of the choreography on that tiny stage adds to the pleasure.
It's time for us to look at Graham anew, both the beauty and the
tackiness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Move and Ms. Stapleton initially asked their friends in the
dance world to participate. Now, choreographers are calling them
for a slot. Ultimately, they invite artists whose work they admire.
The only restriction they have imposed is that no dance can be
longer than 10 minutes. (The rule applies to Move's group as well.)
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers are free to do as they please _ show old work or
devise something new. Tere O'Connor packed 16 of his dance students
from New York University onto the stage. John Jasperse showed a
duet from a dance that will have its premiere in the spring. Every
artist is paid a modest fee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the show starts at the door. The ticket taker is a
drag king named Willy Ryder, slender and handsome with a tough-guy
stance. Once inside, there is a bar and a preshow video collage,
compiled by Charles Atlas, featuring historical dance footage,
numbers from movie musicals and any film clips in which the name
Martha is mentioned, or screamed, as it is in ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bring a whole environment to the event and not
just create a dance showcase,'' Ms. Stapleton says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was one rocky moment. Back in November 1996, five days
before the first Martha(AT)Mother, Ms. Stapleton and Move received
hand-delivered letters from lawyers representing the Graham estate,
basically asking them to cease and desist. The two had used a
photograph of Graham on their flyer, an image given to them by the
photographer. Now Move and his dancers appear on the flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the letter very seriously,'' Ms. Stapleton says, ``and
also answered it immediately, assuring them that nobody was
performing copyrighted works of Martha Graham. They asked for a few
other things, which we were willing to do, including a
disclaimer.'' The disclaimer, visible on the program and flyer,
reads: ``This event is in no way connected to or sponsored by `The
Martha Graham Entities.' '' There has been no correspondence from
the estate since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next Martha(AT)Mother is Jan. 6 and 7. Appearing on the
program will be the mid-career choreographers Molissa Fenley and
Lance Gries, as well as Jose Navas (who is flying in from
Montreal), Hope Clark (best known as a dancer in Elizabeth Strebs's
company), Sandra Kaufman (a newcomer) and Murray Louis, now 72 and
the artistic director of the Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance
Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha and Murray will sit on the stage and reminisce,'' Move
says, smiling. He pauses, then adds, ``I love dance, but I'm also
happy to trash it.''

IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION SHIFTS TO CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISING
EFFORTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee opened
a new front Tuesday in its impeachment investigation of President
Clinton, shifting its focus to the president's campaign
fund-raising efforts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The party-line vote to expand the committee's sex-and-perjury
inquiry drew howls of protest from Democrats who claimed that the
impeachment probe is ``in chaos'' and has been ``hijacked by the
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the investigation ``is the last desperate gasp of a
group of people who are determined to impeach the president and
haven't yet gotten their way,'' said committee member Barney Frank,
a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing during a hearing choreographed to underscore the
seriousness of perjury, the committee voted 20-15 to subpoena
evidence from the Justice Department's two-year investigation of
campaign fund-raising irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking internal Justice Department memos which a
federal judge last week refused to let impeachment investigators
review, the committee approved subpoenas to secure testimony from
FBI Director Louis Freeh and federal prosecutor Charles LaBella.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also voted to subpoena evidence gathered by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr from John Huang, a former
Democratic fund-raiser who agreed to cooperate with Starr's
criminal investigation of the president in return for immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically targeted by the subpoenas are memos written by
Freeh in November 1997 and by LaBella in July and August 1998. The
documents lay out evidence of campaign fund-raising activities by
the president that Freeh and LaBella claim need investigation by an
independent counsel. LaBella is former head of the Justice
Department's campaign fund-raising task force.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has refused to seek appointment
of an outside prosecutor to examine campaign fund raising, has
declined to disclose the contents of the memos, citing the need for
grand jury secrecy. The same position was taken last week by U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who has overseen Starr's
grand jury investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Committee sources said Johnson issued a sealed ruling on Friday
denying a committee request to release the memos. She said the
documents were not relevant enough to the committee's impeachment
investigation to outweigh the need to keep grand jury matters
secret. By expanding the impeachment inquiry and adding the weight
of a subpoena, committee Republicans hope to change the judge's
mind, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief debate over issuing the subpoenas, committee
Chairman Henry Hyde argued that information received by committee
investigators indicates the Freeh and LaBella memos contain
information that should be included in the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents we're seeking ... have been kept in the deep
freeze,'' said Hyde, R-Ill. ``We just want to look at the documents
... and to see whether they lead to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the agency ``will
work with the committee in every way possible, consistent with the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote to take the investigation beyond Clinton's effort to
hide his White House affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky
comes weeks before the committee's self-imposed, end-of-the-year
deadline to finish work. Until Tuesday, the committee had hoped to
vote on articles of impeachment late next week so the full House
could decide before Christmas whether to turn the case over to the
Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde insisted that the expansion of the investigation would not
change his deadline. ``I have absolutely committed myself to
wrapping this up this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing recent predictions from Republican moderates that the
impeachment issue would never survive a House vote, Democrats said
Tuesday's decision is an effort to prop up a faltering inquiry and
shows that the most conservative elements of the Republican Party
had seized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming an impeachment inquiry in search of a high
crime,'' complained Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the committee's
ranking Democrat. He called Tuesday's vote ``a rather desperate
attempt to breathe new life into a dying inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., wrote House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and incoming Speaker Bob Livingston _ who
takes over House leadership next month _ urging them to intervene.
``I fear that this investigation is in chaos due to the lack of
direction,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said Judiciary
Committee Republicans appear to be ``using the powers of the
committee to pursue a totally political end'' by opening an inquiry
into a topic already explored by two separate congressional
committees that found no wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a bad rerun of a show nobody wanted to watch the
first time,'' Lockhart said of the Judiciary Committee vote. ``My
guess is that ... committee has been hijacked by the extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing, only the second public session held by the
full committee, saw a small parade of convicted perjurers, appeals
court judges, retired military brass and law professors. They
agreed that perjury or lying under oath, no matter who commits it
or why, is corrosive and should be punished without favor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 11 witnesses were divided over whether
Clinton committed perjury when he misled attorneys in Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit. And, if he did, whether that should be
enough for the House to impeach him and the Senate to remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury has gradations. Some are serious, some are less,''
said A. Leon Higginbotham, a former federal appeals judge. For
impeachment purposes, Higginbotham said, lying about a sexual
affair is about the same as lying about exceeding the speed limit
in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a president is not a king, he or she must abide by the
same laws as the rest of us,'' said Barbara Battalino, a former
Veterans Affairs psychologist who was convicted of perjury after
lying about a sexual relationship with a patient.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is not impeached, Battalino said, then he should
grant her a presidential pardon. ``If indeed there is no reason for
anything ... more than censure, then certainly I would hope that
the administration would consider leniency for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Adm. Leon A. Edney testified that military forces
are weakened when their ethical guidelines are flouted by a
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of our armed forces must be based on principle,
not litigious double-talk,'' said Edney, who teaches ethics at the
U.S. Naval Academy. ``Military readiness and mission accomplishment
depends on trust and confidence in the integrity of the leader.'' &QL;

 By ALLEN R. MYERSON and AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon, already the United States' largest oil company, formally
agreed on Tuesday to buy Mobil, the next-largest, for $80 billion
in stock, to form the world's biggest corporation on a scale
rivaling that of many nations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is certain to face close examination by
regulators in both the United States and Europe, would reunite the
two largest pieces of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust,
which was broken up in 1911 in the nation's most celebrated
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so great are the uncertainties that the deal will be
approved or completed that investors sent the stock prices of both
companies down Tuesday. Shares of Exxon dropped $3.375, to $71.625,
and Mobil fell $2.25, to $83.75, well below Exxon's offer price of
$99.01 a share based on Monday's closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The companies argued Tuesday that they confront global
competitors and plunging energy prices, making their merger and the
resulting savings a necessity. But while the companies said they
could save $2.8 billion within three years, the greatest costs
would be paid by the 9,000 employees, out of 123,000 worldwide, who
the companies say are likely to find themselves without jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, who
would add the title of president in the combined company, said
repeatedly that further efficiency, not brute size, was his goal.
``This is the case of the whole being greater than the sum of the
parts,'' he said at a news conference, later adding: ``I have
always had the view that the objective is to be best. If in being
best you also have to be biggest, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, to be called Exxon Mobil, would still appear as the
familiar separate entities to motorists, with gas stations and oil
cans still bearing the distinct brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Federal Trade Commission, saying they were
first told of the agreement Tuesday, had no comment. Antitrust
experts said the regulators were likely to review the effects city
by city and region by region, probably requiring the sale of at
least some gas stations and refineries. ``If large divestitures are
required, it could be that the deal doesn't make sense,'' said
Eleanor Fox, who teaches antitrust law at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry analysts agreed with Raymond and Lucio Noto,
Mobil's chief executive, who would be the combined company's vice
chairman, that the corporations and their shareholders would do
better united.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal comes as the mergers that are welding together
many of the world's largest banks, automakers and telephone
companies come to bear on the energy business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the latest combination, saying that other
industry mergers would follow. ``To create lower costs and greater
efficiencies, they had to go outside their own organizations,''
said Frederick Leuffer of Bear, Stearns. ``That same question is
now before the other major oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts said they considered Mobil's $80 billion
price tag to be fairly high, but reasonable considering the
benefits. Raymond said the purchase would have no effect on his
company's profitability in the first year and would begin adding to
earnings per share after that.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon would trade 1.32 shares for each Mobil share, leaving
Exxon shareholders owning 70 percent of the resulting company. The
company would be based at Exxon's current headquarters in Irving,
Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Mobil's headquarters in Fairfax, Va.,
would become the center for refining and sales, while Houston would
be home to exploration, production and chemicals.

</P>
<P>
   The contrasting strengths and styles of the companies and their
chief executives were on display Tuesday at their meetings on Wall
Street with analysts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering from South
Dakota, brought a reputation as a blunt cost-cutter and technician.
Pruning his work force year by year, he has already made his
company a model of efficiency. His shareholder returns at Exxon
usually match the broad market indexes whose advances have been
paced by companies making computer software or chips.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, whose company has slimmed down, too, is better known as a
salesman and international diplomat. While Exxon is cautious about
developing new oil and natural-gas sources abroad, Mobil has
operations ranging from Indonesia to the Persian Gulf and the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when chief executives flaunt their hobbies, their
wives and their Hollywood friends, Raymond remains unfriendly to
the media, refusing to become a celebrity and deflecting questions
he deems redundant or dumb. ``I'm not interested in your views of
how we ought to deal with the FTC,'' he told a reporter on Tuesday
who asked why his company had not begun by telling the agency what
operations it was willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   So if Raymond took the lead in reciting the merger's
particulars, it fell to Noto to set forth the imperatives in more
human terms. ``This is not a combination based on desperation,'' he
said. ``It is one based on opportunity. But we need to face some
facts. The world has changed. The easy things are behind us. The
easy oil, the easy cost savings, they're done. So all of us are now
looking for some way to make a jump, to make a quantum leap, to be
able to deliver more value to our shareholders, and our employees
and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto was likewise the one who explained that while managers
couldn't offer more details of the likely job cuts, ``They are not
cold and indifferent. They understand that jobs are important and
they understand the impact on communities.'' About 40 percent, or
50,000, of the companies' employees are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The executives bemoaned oil prices that are low and getting
lower, since the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries finished
their recent meeting without doing much more than agreeing to meet
again. But they said their agreement was based far more on their
views of where their competitors and their industry were going over
the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   In a consolidating industry, they said, they see powerful
national oil companies expanding to other countries. They spoke of
the need for huge amounts of capital and deep technological
expertise to produce oil and natural gas from beneath arctic ice
and unexplored seas.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts to sell their agreement to the public appear to be
off to a slow start. Exxon's handling of the 1989 grounding of its
Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska has come to be known as one of the
industry's worst environmental and public relations disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Parting company with European competitors like British Petroleum
and Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon and Mobil are also bucking the
public's growing environmental concerns by opposing a treaty to
slow global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Since news of their talks broke last Wednesday, antitrust
experts and consumer advocates have been picking it apart.
``Rockefeller's revenge'' is how the merger was described by Andrew
Heaney, president of Heat USA, a fuel-oil buying cooperative in
Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's little question in my mind that if you have
industry consolidation on this magnitude, you're going to see
energy prices controlled by fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has been far more ardent in seeking partners, allies and
acquisitions, combining its European refineries and gas stations
with British Petroleum's. Exxon has stood aloof, assuming it was
large enough to fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond said in a brief interview Tuesday that he had been
pondering how much more profitable his company could become in
league with Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation began after an American Petroleum Institute
Committee meeting last June, when their ostensible subject was a
possible alliance in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should talk about that,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That and other things,'' Noto responded. About three weeks
later, they began merger talks in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been briefed on their discussions said that
agreements on price came easily and early. Sorting through the
potential antitrust obstacles and deciding who should get what job
took longer. The boards held their own separate discussions as
well, especially on the antitrust questions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how well he would adjust to being a mere employee again,
Noto said that he had worked for other people for 32 of his 36
years at Mobil. He appeared comfortable enough at Raymond's side on
Tuesday to say, ``We do a bear act if you give us a moment.''

   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee voted along party
lines to issue new subpoenas related to President Clinton's
campaign finances, the top House Democrat called on Republican
leaders Tuesday to rein in the impeachment proceedings and ``bring
us out of the chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Stating a view held even by some Republicans, Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt charged that a leadership vacuum had developed at the
critical final stage in the House impeachment inquiry because of
the transition of power from Speaker Newt Gingrich to Rep. Bob
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot deal with something as grave and important as
impeachment without some common-sense process that everyone
understands,'' Gephardt said in a news conference, where he
announced he was sending a letter to Livingston. ``No one seems to
be in charge. No one seems to be grabbing the reins.'' He called
for some Republican leader to ``drive this train to a certain
outcome that everybody in the country understands and believes is a
fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, Livingston's spokesman, said, ``We haven't seen
the letter yet. They are entitled to their opinion.'' Christina
Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said ``there is a legislative
procedure already under way'' in the Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans close to different factions in the House
leadership described a situation in which neither Gingrich nor
Livingston necessarily wanted to preside over the impeachment vote.
A Republican congressman close to Livingston said the Louisiana
Republican viewed his leadership as beginning in January and ``he's
really staying studiously out of this.'' The Republican, who spoke
on the condition that he not be identified, said, ``Frankly,
there's no upside for the new speaker. This is on Newt Gingrich's
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Republican close to the departing Gingrich camp said,
``There is a school of thought that perhaps the first great act Bob
Livingston does as speaker is end the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's appeals were echoed by Democrats in the House
Judiciary Committee, who called throughout a daylong hearing into
the consequences of perjury for a bipartisan move to censure
Clinton instead of impeaching him. The Democrats sharply protested
the committee's 20-15 vote along party lines to issue four
subpoenas that moved the committee beyond the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and into his campaign
fund-raising.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee called for FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles La
Bella, a former Justice Department prosecutor, to be deposed about
their recommendations that Attorney General Janet Reno name an
independent counsel to look into the president's 1996 campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   It also subpoenaed the two men's memorandums to Ms. Reno making
their case and several Justice Department analyses of their
reports. And it subpoenaed Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for
any documents related to John Huang, the Democratic fund-raiser who
had raised most of the questionable donations that the Democratic
Party later returned. But overnight the committee's Republicans
dropped plans to seek documents about several other Democratic
fund-raising figures and to subpoena the president, too, in a
demand that he direct Reno to produce the memos.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, said that despite the
new tack he still hoped his committee could complete its inquiry
this month. But he said the memos the committee sought had been
``kept in a deep freeze'' and that ``we're going to take a look.''
He said, ``We are not participating in a wild goose chase.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans also acknowledged that if they found new
evidence they wanted to pursue that their timetable could slip, and
for the first time there was rumbling among senior House Republican
aides that the House could put off a vote on any proposed articles
of impeachment until January _ and possibly hand it to the new
106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long been intrigued by the memos submitted by
La Bella and Freeh, and have been critical of Reno's failure to
name an independent counsel to look into the 1996 fund raising.
Just this week she declined to name such a counsel to investigate
Vice President Al Gore and she faces a deadline of next week on
whether to appoint one to look into allegations that Clinton
violated the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Two other congressional committee chairmen, Sen. Orrin Hatch of
the Senate Judiciary Committee and Rep. Dan Burton of the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, have sought in vain to
obtain the unedited copies of the documents. Hyde also tried to get
access to the unedited memos earlier in his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, in response to a request from the Justice
Department, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson issued a
sealed ruling holding that there was not sufficient need for the
House Judiciary Committee to have access to the unedited memos,
which contain secret grand jury information. But having now issued
a subpoena, committee Republicans plan to make their own case
before the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the committee Republicans, said
they were interested in the memos because they ''may contain
allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the President.'' He did not
specify further.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans said that with the committee set to
begin drafting articles of impeachment against the president next
week, they doubted they would find anything substantial in the
memos to pursue. ``My expectation level is low about what we're
going to find,'' said Rep. W. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., ``but it's
important to take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., said the committee was simply curious
because Congress had never seen the full memos. ``The mystery begs
for a solution,'' he said, ``and begs for a look see.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats today questioned the committee's new course. ``This is
the last desperate gasp of a group of people who were determined to
impeach the president and haven't yet gotten their way,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And White House press secretary Joe Lockhart noted that
investigations of the 1996 campaign had been going on in Congress
for two years. ``This is like a bad rerun of a show that nobody
wanted to watch the first time,'' he said. He said the day's
developments had confirmed the president's decision not to appear
before the committee in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I think anyone who watched the proceeding over the
last few hours would understand why the president of the United
States has no business in that room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it takes another new tack, the committee is expected to
vote toward the end of next week on as many as three articles of
impeachment against the president. At least one article, on
perjury, is considered certain to win committee approval on a
strict party line vote.
</P>
<P>
   It remains far from clear whether there is support in the full
House to impeach the president, with a wavering group of moderate
Republicans likely to decide Clinton's fate. No party leaders are
methodically counting votes, making it harder than usual to
determine the mood of the House, but the vote on an article of
impeachment on perjury is generally considered too close to call.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to merger advice, J.P. Morgan isn't the
brand name that first comes to mind. Unless you're rooting around
in the oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   The company's energy bankers were in the executive suite with
Exxon Corp. chairman Lee Raymond, advising him on Tuesday's
announced $80 billion takeover of Mobil Corp. They were at the
table with British Petroleum executives when it agreed to buy Amoco
Corp. for $42.8 billion last August. And in their spare time, they
advised Belgian oil concern Petrofina SA in its $13 billion sale to
Total SA of France, which was announced Tuesday too.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne corks are popping at J. P. Morgan. Especially for Rod
Peacock, the banker who co-heads J.P. Morgan's global natural
resources and power investment banking group. Peacock clearly
enjoys his role at the center of J.P. Morgan's energy effort, where
he not only led the teams which worked for both Exxon and British
Petroleum, but also represented Mobil in its $5 billion European
joint venture with British Petroleum in August of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as an analyst at British Petroleum right out
of college _he graduated with a degree in engineering science and
economics from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1970 _ he was hired by
J.P. Morgan as an energy analyst. But in 1982, eight years later,
Peacock traded in his spreadsheet for pin stripes and has since
worked as an investment banker specializing in the oil and gas
industries. ``I think you use a broader range of skills if you are
an investment banker,'' he said, noting that he keeps offices in
both London and New York. ``It's interesting to witness the
complete restructuring of this industry at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, knowing the right people helps ensure a seat at the
table. Exxon chairman Raymond sits on J.P. Morgan's board of
directors, for one thing. Ferrell McClean, who co-heads the group
with Peacock, said Raymond had discussed the idea of an Exxon deal
with J.P. Morgan chairman Douglas ``Sandy'' Warner III last summer.
Then, she said, Warner and Peacock met with Raymond to discuss
where the oil and gas industry was headed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Peacock has been quite busy. Peacock admits he has
few hobbies, having quit coaching his son's soccer team a few years
ago because he couldn't commit the time he wanted to. But he still
finds time to run. He is demure about his age _ ``something in the
late 40s,'' is all he'll say _ and jokes that he never met the
Beatles even though he grew up in their hometown of Liverpool,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock is clearly uncomfortable talking about himself,
answering questions in short sentences and stressing the team
effort at J.P. Morgan. He mentioned, among others, Jeremy Wilson, a
senior member of his group, and Ms. McClean who said she is good
friends with Peacock's wife and helped plan their wedding
reception. When asked about his favorite deals, he mentions, not
surprisingly, the last three deals he has worked on. That could be,
in part, because of the huge fees that are likely to be earned by
J.P. Morgan for their effort.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., which advised Mobil, are
mum about how much money they are likely to earn. But industry
executives say all of the advisers _ including lawyers and bankers
_ could earn $100 million in total. Exxon was advised by lawyers at
Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell and Mobil hired lawyers from Skadden Arps
Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom. By contrast, investment banks earned $115
million in fees when Chrysler Corp. merged with German carmaker
Daimler Benz this year, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly if recent events are any indicator, talent in the
once sleepy industrial sector is commanding a premium. Mac Heller,
head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, who has a
background in the oil and gas sector, was the lead banker on the
team for Mobil. And Goldman recently offered partnerships to two
recruits in the industrial sector: Michael Carr, who co-headed the
mergers and acquisitions group at Salomon Smith Barney, and more
recently Gordon Dyal, the talented young banker who sat across the
table from Peacock when Dyal represented Amoco while an investment
banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

U.S. TO RELEASE SECRET PAPERS ON PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PINOCHET-NYT)

 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treading into a political and diplomatic
confrontation it tried to avoid, the United States decided on
Tuesday to declassify some secret government documents on the
killing and torture conducted by the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, whose predecessor was the target of American coup
plots.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release such documents is the first sign that
the United States would cooperate in the case against Pinochet, and
potentially could open ``a can of worms,'' in the words of a former
CIA official stationed in Chile, exposing the depth of the
knowledge that the United States had about the crimes of the
Pinochet government.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA worked closely with Chile's secret police in the 1970s,
at the time of the Pinochet regime's worst human-rights abuses,
which included more than 3,000 killings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83 years old and a senator for life in Chile, ruled
from 1973 to 1990. He stepped down as commander in chief of the
Chilean armed forces earlier this year. He was arrested in London
on a Spanish court's warrant in October. The court wants to try him
for human rights abuses in the deaths of Spanish and other
citizens. Last week, Britain's highest court denied him the
immunity he had claimed as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred uneasiness in American diplomatic and
intelligence circles. While some European government officials have
supported bringing the former dictator to court, U.S. officials
have largely stayed silent, reflecting skepticism about the Spanish
court's power, doubts about international tribunals aimed at former
foreign rulers, and worries over the implications for American
leaders who might someday also be accused in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who served as his
national security adviser and secretary of state, supported a
right-wing coup in Chile to overthorow the government of President
Salvador Allende Gossens in the early 1970s, previously
declassified documents show.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the actions of the United States during the 1973
coup, and much of what American leaders and intelligence services
did in liaison with the Pinochet government after it seized power,
remain under the seal of national security.
</P>
<P>
   The secret files on the Pinochet regime are held by the CIA, the
Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon,
the National Security Council, the National Archives, the
presidential libraries of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department records, these files contain a
history of human rights abuses and international terrorism:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1975, State Department diplomats in Chile protested the
Pinochet regime's record of killing and torture, filing dissents to
American foreign policy with their superiors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA has files on assassinations by the regime and the
Chilean secret police. The intelligence agency also has records on
Chile's attempts to establish an international right-wing
covert-action squad.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Ford library contains many of Kissinger's secret files on
Chile, which never have been made public. Through a secretary,
Kissinger declined a request for an interview on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish court asked the Justice Department to review and
release the documents under a legal assistance treaty between the
United States and Spain. The treaty gives the United States broad
discretion to produce or withhold classified documents from the
court, but Clinton administration officials said they believed the
benefits of openness in human rights cases outweighed the risks to
national security in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human
Rights Watch in New York. ``The proof will be what documents we
finally get, how useful they are, and how long it takes to get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This should not be a pretext for not having a policy
on the need to bring to Pinochet to justice for the thousands of
murders and disappearances committed during his rule. The United
States' silence on that question is being interpreted all over the
world as passive support for impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens were killed by Pinochet's forces _ among them
Ronni Moffitt, a 25-year-old researcher blown up by a car bomb a
mile from the White House in 1976, along with a former Chilean
foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, and Charles Horman, a
31-year-old film maker, writer and human-rights activist murdered
during the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has been officially silent on the question of
bringing the former dictator to justice for those crimes, publicly
deferring to the Spanish, British and Chilean courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials, speaking on the condition that they would
not be quoted directly or by name, said that they had deep concerns
about the idea that a Spanish judge could reach across
international borders and try a former foreign leader. They said
the United States had opposed the idea of a permanent international
tribunal for crimes against humanity for the same reasons that
officials are queasy about the Pinochet case. They said they feared
that U.S. officials might be accused by foreign judges looking into
the deaths of citizens in nations where American policy has had
violent consequences.
</P>
<P>
   France, Switzerland and Belgium have joined Spain in seeking
Pinochet's extradition for crimes committed against their citizens.
But no senior U.S. official has addressed Pinochet's role as a
dictatorial leader who shared some goals and some enemies with
Washington when he took power 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in accountability and we are heartened by calls for
accountability in Chile,'' said the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin. ``We also believe in Chile's democracy. We're not
prepared to say anything publicly beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret files ``may shed light on human rights abuses during
the Pinochet era,'' Rubin said. ``We will declassify and make
public as much information as possible consistent with our laws and
national security.'' A CIA spokesman echoed the latter remark.
</P>
<P>
   Declassifying the documents could take months, as government
officials review them page by page, blacking out sensitive
information, like the names of spies, before they release them.
Some documents may be withheld entirely, and some published only in
part.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The role of the United States in trying to stop the 1970
election of a Marxist president of Chile, Allende, and to organize
a coup against the newly elected president that same year, is
well-known. But its role in the 1973 coup that succeeded in
deposing the Allende government, and its subsequent support for the
Pinochet junta, remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Secret American efforts to overthrow Allende ``never really
ended,'' a chief of CIA covert operations at the time, Thomas
Karamessines, later told Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little or no documentation of those efforts after
1970, and some former officials say the United States did not play
a direct role in the 1973 coup. ``The CIA had nothing to do with
that coup,'' said the former CIA official who served in Chile.
``But it wasn't a complete surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency records on the regime's
secret police may help answer a question Horman's and Ms. Moffitt's
survivors have been asking for more than 20 years _ what the United
States knew about the killings of Americans and other victims of
the Pinochet regime.

 &HT;    Nixon coming back to Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves grew a little older Tuesday. They
also grew far deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Nixon is returning to the club after a five-year absence,
and Ozzie Guillen, who bailed the Braves out of a shortstop problem
last season, also agreed to terms, bringing to 16 the players now
under contract for next season. Together, Atlanta signed up 30
years of major league experience at a combined age of 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess from an experience standpoint, that's good,'' general
manager John Schuerholz said. ``From an age standpoint, that maybe
a little. ... But those guys really make our bench. Our bench is
going to be very strong and very versatile.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the 40-man roster, the team released outfielder
Curtis Pride and placed shortstop prospect Glenn Williams on
outright waivers. Pride appeared in 70 games last year and hit .252
but was a disappointing pinch-hitter at .184.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who will turn 40 next month, agreed to a one-year
contract after hitting .297 last season in Minnesota, which tied
his career-high average reached with the Braves in 1991. As a
Brave, he hit .286 with 160 stolen bases in his three Atlanta
seasons but has slowed little in the five years since, batting .284
with 242 steals in subsequent seasons with Boston, Texas, Toronto,
Los Angeles and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   His 37 steals in 1998 ranked eighth in the American League and
his .361 on-base percentage surpassed all Braves regulars except
Chipper Jones, Walt Weiss and Andres Galarraga. Nixon joins Ryan
Klesko, Brian Jordan and Gerald Williams as outfielders signed for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings to us exactly the package we were looking for,''
Schuerholz said. ``A guy who can steal, with a high on-base
percentage, creates some tension for the other team when he's on
base, a guy we know, a guy who played well for us before. He was
sort of a perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, who hit .277 while starting in 58 games at short when
Weiss was hurt, became a critical component after being picked up
in May following his release in Baltimore. Though several clubs
showed interest this winter in picking up the 34-year-old, the
Braves made a two-year offer to sign him.

MIAMI RESTORES GAY RIGHTS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ More than 20 years after Anita Bryant's ``save our
children'' crusade led to the repeal here of one of the country's
first gay rights ordinances and galvanized the debate over gay
rights in the nation, the Miami-Dade County commission Tuesday
voted again to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's hearing chambers erupted in bear hugs, kisses
and tears as the 13 commissioners voted 7 to 6 to amend the
county's anti-discrimination law to prohibit unequal treatment of
homosexuals in housing, employment, credit and finance and public
accommodation. Many who remember Ms. Bryant's campaign for repeal
of a similar law in 1977 saw Tuesday's action as a vindication
laden with symbolism and historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that we've grown up,'' said Carlos Hazday, 40, an
accountant who served as manager of SAVE Dade, as the pro-amendment
campaign dubbed itself, an acronym for ``Safeguarding American
Values for Everyone.'' ``We're not perfect, we still have
differences, but we're learning from our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both gay rights activists and Miami officials agree that the
vote reflects a national change in attitude as Americans have
become increasingly fair-minded about equal rights for gays. Miami
also has grown into a metropolis of more than 2 million that prides
itself on its ethnic diversity and is trying to sell a world-class
image. Officials say it cannot afford to be perceived as intolerant
of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Two main factors appear to have helped propel Miami's measure
forward after a similar bill introduced last year did not make it
to a final vote. One was the case of Matthew Shepard, the gay
college student in Wyoming who died last October after he was
kidnapped, beaten and left tied to a fence for 18 hours. The crime
fanned outrage over hate crimes nationwide and became a theme here
during the hearing that preceded Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you unleash hatred it's only natural that some people
would run with it, and sometimes it becomes deadly,'' said
Commissioner Jimmy L. Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Many Miami political and civic leaders rallied behind the
measure using the argument that intolerance is bad for an economy
that depends on tourism and new investment. Other municipalities in
south Florida, including Broward County and Miami Beach, have
already enacted gay rights legislation or laws extending benefits
to domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greater Miami is no longer a provincial, backwater town,''
Miami Beach Mayor Neisen Kasdin, whose city is a major destination
for gay tourists, told the commission. ``Let's not retreat from our
destiny as a major international city.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Church officials, who had sided with Ms. Bryant in the
1970s, did not take a stand on the debate this time, noting that
the ordinance exempts religious organizations from its
requirements. But opponents of the ordinance were mostly religious
leaders and conservatives who deride the law as condoning
homosexuality and as granting special rights for lifestyle choices
or to a segment of the population that does not need them.
</P>

 MIAMI: from discrimination.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven states, 27 counties and 136 cities have passed
anti-discrimination laws protecting gays, and fewer than 10 of the
laws have been repealed, said the Human Rights Campaign, a national
advocacy organization on gay issues. Although some studies have
shown few claims are filed under the laws, partly because many gay
men and women are reluctant to publicly reveal their sexual
orientation, supporters of the ordinances say they deter unfair
treatment and set a tone that encourages similar policies in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at Tuesday's hearing included gay police officers,
attorneys and others who related instances of harassment in the
workplace and job opportunities lost because of their
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people see 1977 as the beginning of the rise of the
extreme right in this country, with a real focus on anti-gay
rhetoric. This shows how far we've come toward basic fairness for
gay Americans,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of Human
Rights Campaign, speaking from Washington, D.C. ``This is a
wonderful victory for Miami-Dade County but it's a watershed
victory for gays and lesbians nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a gay rights ordinance in Miami was a particular
thorn for the gay rights movement because Miami had been the first
major urban area in the country to pass legislation protecting
homosexuals. But that show of leadership was severely eroded when
Ms. Bryant, then a singer, advertising personality and devout
Baptist who lived in Miami Beach but had a national reputation, led
a campaign to repeal a gay rights law county commissioners passed
in 1977, calling it an attempt to legitimize ``a perverse and
dangerous'' lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   At one point she argued the law was a license for homosexuals to
recruit and molest children.
</P>
<P>
   The law was repealed by voters by a margin of more than 2 to 1
that year _ but it also undermined the career of Ms. Bryant, who
took her campaign to other states. She lost entertainment
engagements and was dropped as spokeswoman of the Florida Citrus
Commission in orange juice ads. Efforts to reach Ms. Bryant by
telephone were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The issue remained dormant until last year, when a county
commissioner introduced a gay rights bill that did not survive to
the a public hearing stage or progress to a final commission vote.
Supporters regrouped in the last 18 months, and say they are
prepared to fight a repeal effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we turned the corner today as a community,''
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who had urged a ``yes'' vote,
said. ``We're much more progressive, tolerant and mature.''
</P>
<P>
   It is striking, however, that it took the ordinance 21 years to
resurface in an area that encompasses cities like Miami Beach,
where homosexuals are an integral part of the culture. Gay rights
advocates say other priorities, such as the area's need to absorb
wave after wave of immigrants, have put issues such as gay rights
in the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   But for those like the Cuban-born Hazday, who has lived here for
25 years, the Anita Bryant campaign is etched in memory. He said he
was a college freshman when ``I saw the hatred and division Anita
Bryant brought to our county.'' He added, ``I promised myself next
time I would get involved,'' he said.

 How to Get Clients to Pay on Time  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  How does a small business get clients to pay on time. I
sell document templates to law firms and don't have a large cash
flow. Most clients pay on time (within 15 days) but some, notably
the larger ones, ignore the invoice date and pay when they feel
like it, in 45 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Collection chores for small businesses have been
compared to the duty of parents to change their kids' diapers.
Someone has to do it, but no one wants to.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, it sounds like more of an annoyance than calamity,
which is good. Given your clientele, you probably want to avoid
legal action. But experts say there are other steps you can take to
improve the process:
</P>
<P>
   _You might change the terms of your engagement letter. For
example, require more payment up front and less on delivery of the
final product.
</P>
<P>
   _Big companies are often notorious for paying late, partly
because they are governed by inflexible computer systems and
accounting programs. But that doesn't mean you can't be a squeaky
wheel and call until you get results. Alice Magos, small-business
analyst for Chicago's CCH Inc., which publishes how-to books,
suggests phoning the accounting department, not the purchasing
agent or person you normally do business with.
</P>
<P>
   _Offer incentives for paying early or disincentives for paying
late. Magos notes that car parts and other businesses sometimes
offer terms like ``2 percent 10 days Net 30,'' meaning a 2 percent
discount on the bill if the customer pays within 10 days instead of
30. That might be attractive in service businesses too, especially
to smaller customers who are trying to save money. Conversely, you
might impose a carrying charge if the bill is not paid in 60 or 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these tactics will guarantee payment, prompt
or otherwise. There are books and Web sites filled with information
and form letters to improve your chances of extracting money from
customers. For starters, check Nolo Press ( &LR; www.nolo.com &LR; ) and CCH
( &LR; www.toolkit.cch.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Surviving Success
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do when success overwhelms you? The phone is
ringing off the hook, but I don't want to hire anyone to help me as
I don't have the time to supervise them.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a dilemma but better than many of the problems facing
budding businesses, and luckily you have a bunch of options.
</P>
<P>
   A simple solution, but not necessarily the best for your
long-term prospects, is get extra choosy about whom you want to do
business with or even raise your prices or rates.
</P>
<P>
   A better option might be to hire someone to answer your phone.
That should not take much training, although you should still set
aside a specific time every day to respond to the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring employees involves keeping track of state, federal,
Social Security and Medicare taxes and periodic filings that will
just about double your paperwork, according to CPA Bernard
Kamaroff, author of the best-seller ``Small Time Operator'' (Bell
Springs Publishing, 1998, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   As a simpler alternative, he recommends the independent
contractor route and hiring an answering service. Be sure you
understand the differences between an employee and outside
contractor. For example, the Internal Revenue Service is likely to
consider a person an employee rather than independent contractor if
the person uses your materials and equipment, receives on-the-job
training, works on your premises, hires or supervises your workers,
and receives health insurance, vacation pay or similar employee
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the phone problem, Kamaroff suggests you might find
someone in a similar business and subcontract with that person to
provide service to your customers, much as building contractors
farm out work when they get swamped. You can then take back this
business as you hire more employees when your business expands.
</P>
<P>
   For more personal help, marketing consultant Jay Levinson
suggests calling the Service Corps of Retired Executives, whose
volunteers also are sometimes independent contractors. Temp firms
might also provide some help.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Customers
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the best way for a small consulting business that
provides a specialized technical/ professional service to obtain
clients when first starting out? I don't think cold-calling works.
</P>
<P>
   A: If your service is related to a specific product or
technology, you might talk to manufacturers about becoming a
resource for them. Many companies have ``technical support''
personnel, but their time and expertise are limited, according to
San Francisco career counselor and author Marty Nemko (``Cool
Careers for Dummies,'' IDG Books, $16.99). To help their customers
and take some of the hassle out of providing support services
themselves, companies might want to use you as a certified or
recommended consultant if you can demonstrate your competence and
show that referrals will be in the company's interest as well as
yours.
</P>
<P>
   You might also develop ``cross- referral'' relationships with
consultants in related fields. For example, if you are a wine
fermentation specialist, you might know or get to know an expert in
vineyard pest control whom you could refer clients to, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Nemko also encourages attending professional conferences to make
contacts, or better yet, make a presentation. If you are
uncomfortable before a crowd, consider writing an article for a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Networking in any business is important. Make a list of people
you know in related fields, let them know what you are doing and
mention if they are in a situation where it might be appropriate to
mention your consulting business, you would appreciate it.
``There's no more powerful way to get business than for someone to
recommend you,'' says Nemko.

 Tech Rebound Puts Investors, Researchers in the Holiday Mood  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Perhaps technology investors have been nipping at the egg nog a tad
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because suddenly these once-sober folks are starting to believe
that this is going to be a merry Christmas after all, and that 1999
could indeed be a happy new year.
</P>
<P>
   This resurgent holiday spirit is not about being naughty or
nice, either. Tech investors and researchers are simply starting to
think _ perhaps prematurely _ that personal computer sales could
continue their current boomlet well into next year, which would
kick-start sales of software, hardware, chips and computer-related
services.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel, Dell and Microsoft soared like St. Nick's
sleigh over a rooftop yesterday buoyed by anecdotal accounts of
robust PC sales across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Intel saw its shares vault $7.37, or 6.9 percent, to $115.
Shares of computer-maker Dell jumped $4 to $64.81, while Microsoft
stock soared $7.50 to close at $129.50.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, nowhere is the glow of holiday PC sales
being felt more warmly than here in arid Arizona, where Credit
Suisse First Boston is holding a cozy confab for institutional
investors and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Who says you have to stroll through Union Square to get in the
mood for Christmas shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Scottsdale seems to be working well for this group of fund
managers. This is CS First Boston's first holiday party with its
new technology banking team led by Frank Quattrone, Bill Brady and
George Boutros _ defectors from the ol' Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
unit.
</P>
<P>
   And needless to say, these rather well-compensated Santa's
helpers are giving their clients opportunities to do some early
window shopping for future purchases for their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while spirits among techies have been lifted, by no
means is the conference brimming with unbridled euphoria. It's just
that things are looking a little brighter than they were, say, in
August, says CS First Boston's director of research Michael
Kwatinetz.
</P>
<P>
   Because the weeklong salon is held shortly before many companies
implement self-imposed gag orders toward the end of the fourth
quarter, ``this is really an important week to get your hands
around things,'' Kwatinetz notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early in the week, but the reading so far is on the
positive side of things,`` he says.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Dell (CEO Michael Dell is speaking today),
Gateway, Intel and Microsoft offering their two cents on the recent
PC surge, money managers hope to garner a clearer notion of whether
the rebound is real, or just a ghost of Christmases past, Kwatinetz
says. Comparing the chipmakers' forecasts with the outlooks of the
PC-makers and the computer resellers should give investors an
inkling as to whether technology stocks are poised to make any kind
of run in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always worried. But this is a great opportunity to
try figure out what's going on,'' Kwatinetz says. We'll keep you
posted.

ADOBE'S MOTTO: `WE DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 Steven Drukman, a theater critic for Artforum magazine, is an
adjunct professor in New York University's drama department.  
 (af)  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the bravado of youth, the Adobe Theater Company,
a nonprofit troupe that prefers to spell its name in lowercase
letters, shuns other unnecessary highs: high art, high-handedness
and _ until their recent transfer to the 170-seat Actors Playhouse
in Greenwich Village _ high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But after their critically acclaimed ``Duet!: A Romantic
Fable,'' a pulpy parody of puppy love and American culture, closed
with sold-out houses in SoHo last year, this Off Off Broadway
troupe took the leap to their first open-ended commercial run and
reopened the play Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our original mission statement was, `We do what we want to
do,' '' said Jeremy Dobrish, the company's 30-year-old artistic
director and founder. ``We hope we are still doing that, but with a
little more attention.'' For the eight-year-old Adobe, a company
that has, Dobrish said, ``cleaned toilets and rat droppings in
small downtown theaters so we could work there,'' the move is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Combining talking animals and punning trees with macabre plot
turns, ``Duet!'' seems poised somewhere between Saturday morning
cartoons and ``Saturday Night Live'' as directed by David Lynch,
and geared to an audience weaned on television.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute show was developed and staged in episodes for five
years by Erin Quinn Purcell and her co-writer and co-performer
Gregory Jackson, whom she had dated 12 years ago when they were
freshmen at the University of Iowa. The play, which focuses on a
young couple (portrayed by Ms. Purcell and Jackson, both 30) who
meet and begin dating, opened in its current form in in 1997 at the
75-seat Ohio Theater, directed by its two chief performers and
Dobrish.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is not an Adobe member, said, ``The spoof quality
of `Duet!' was something Erin and I had done since college, and it
was great that the Adobe, with its playful esthetic, found us and
we found them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company's move ``uptown'' to the Village could not
be financed alone. Adobe's average annual operating budget is about
$83,000; it has cost $190,000 for the commercial remounting of
``Duet!'' To the rescue came Dodger Endemol Theatricals, a producer
of such current mainstream Broadway fare as the musicals
``Footloose'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fans, pure and simple,'' said Michael David of Dodger
Endemol, which became a producer of ``Duet!'' ``I came to them
after seeing three of their shows. `Duet!' is such good theater
that it seemed serendipitous to support them at this time. It's a
win-win situation. They need us, and we felt the need to expose the
future of the theater. Twenty-five years ago, grants and
foundations did this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' support of ``Duet!'' may reflect a trend in New
York theater: producers with deep pockets, often with several
Broadway productions up and running, taking financial risks on
shows clearly aimed at younger audiences. Fran and Barry Weissler
are planning to produce the commercial transfer of Kenneth
Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth,'' now at Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   And the Shubert Organization's backing of the recent ``Stupid
Kids,'' a tale about being gay in high school, was a play,
according to Gerald Schoenfeld, the organization's chairman, that
was ``taken on in the hopes of getting young people into the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a collective of 26 actors, designers and playwrights, Adobe
initially involved six people when it was founded in 1991, five of
whom were friends from Wesleyan University, including Dobrish and
Christopher Roberts, 31, the producing director. The troupe's
offices were in Dobrish's living room in the Flatiron district of
Manhattan until 1997, when they rented office space from the
Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   With his beard, pony tail and casual clothes, Dobrish, who grew
up on the Upper West Side, still looks like a college student. The
fact that he and Roberts called their company Adobe to evoke a
sense of homeyness and because the word to them looks like ``a
visual palindrome,'' reflects the kind of breezy collegiate style
that still informs some of the company's work.
</P>
<P>
   Their first break came in 1992 when a company dropped out of its
rental agreement with SoHo Rep, and Dobrish, then working at the
theater, was given the booking in exchange for box office duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't turn it down, even though I had no play,'' he said
recently over lunch in a diner near his apartment. ``I threw
together an evening of sketches called `True Words Are Never
Spoken,' hardly our crowning achievement, but it launched us.''
</P>
<P>
   This early effort, which Roberts wryly describes as ``modest in
its ambitions and its achievements,'' made an instant playwright
out of Dobrish, who has since written or directed most of the
company's 20 or so productions. It also defined the troupe's
esthetic, which draws from ``high art to pop culture, fairy tales
to urban myths and traditional theater to modern performance art,''
in Dobrish's words.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``Duet!'' in The New York Times last year,
Peter Marks called the company ``an 80-channel cable television
system, accepting signals from a host of sources.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While this cut-and-paste style may be more the rule than the
exception on Off Off Broadway, Adobe differs from other downtown
troupes in its focus on the audience. Spectators can buy beer and
soda onstage before a performance and are invited to talk with cast
members after every show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you get a sense of community these days, besides
church or the local bar?'' Dobrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Early experiments with audience involvement included pre-show
pranks like an on-stage ringing telephone. And ``fun'' and
``entertaining'' seem to be favorite words of Dobrish and Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wood, an actor currently playing the title role in ``Side
Man'' on Broadway, performed in Dobrish-directed productions with
the Adobe between 1992 and 1994. Wood compared the current
``Duet!'' ``to everything Adobe does, in that it captures the
company's spirit: sweet, but not afraid to show the grotesque side
of human nature, like Grimms' fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrish, in fact, adapted a Grimms tale for ``The Handless
Maiden,'' his company's well-received play last spring that was set
in both ``the faraway kingdom of New York City'' and magical
forests of demons.
</P>
<P>
   Like their art, Dobrish and Roberts wear their erudition
lightly, quoting rock musicians (John Lennon and Bob Dylan) rather
than Bertolt Brecht or Antonin Artaud to explain their artistic
philosophies. And they borrow from everyone, including critics.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, described
Adobe's 1995 film-noir satire ``Blink of an Eye'' as ``Pirandello
on Prozac,'' Dobrish thought, ``Hey, I've read `Six Characters in
Search of an Author' but I should read some more Pirandello.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, adapting an obscure Pirandello play, ``Each in His Own
Way,'' he incorporated images of mobsters from popular culture and
dialogue filled with contemporary vernacular. The result was last
year's ``Notions in Motion,'' a gangster spoof that played with
theatrical illusion, written and directed by Dobrish in a style he
calls ``Pirandello meets Tarantino.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notions in Motion'' was the Adobe success of which he is most
proud. ``It got high school students into the theater, and they
were screaming and shouting,'' he said. ``They might never have
been in the theater before, and suddenly they were sticking around
to talk about the play with the actors afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrish, who was a psychology and theater major in college, says
he enjoys theater that is ``accessible'' and expresses disdain for
the ``self-conscious preciousness'' that some people associate with
downtown experimental theater. ``I would often go see things Off
Off Broadway,'' Dobrish said, ``and feel like I was at a party with
the cool kids, but I wasn't really invited.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentions as influences the director Mark Brokaw (``This Is
Our Youth'') and the playwright Tony Kushner, but he is more likely
to emulate artistic directors _ Doug Aibel of the Vineyard Theater
and Neil Pepe of the Atlantic, for example _ and speaks of admiring
artists for sustaining long careers in the theater. Richard Foreman
and David Mamet, two far-flung names with whom he admits no
stylistic affinity, are to Dobrish ``heroic'' in this regard.

   He likes to call the Adobe ``a downtown theater with an uptown
sensibility.'' ``Our company believes,'' he said, ``that it's too
bad people think of Off Off Broadway as sitting trapped in some hot
basement, watching untalented actors being pretentious. Let's not
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Adobe's downtown following be alienated by the move to
Off Broadway and the $45 ticket price it demands? Roberts bristled:
``Suddenly, the media notices you and wonders, `Why are you
moving?' Everyone forgets that that's the reality of the economic
mechanisms in the theater of getting your work seen. You'd never
say to a painter, `You must show that painting 20 times and then
put it in the closet and never show it again.' ''

CONSUMER GROUPS HAVE MIXED REACTION TO OIL MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Mass., Ohio, Conn.)  (See also EXXON-MOBIL, EXXON-CULTURE, EXXON-ANTITRUST, EXXON-ASIA,
EXXON-DEAL, EXXON-ASSESS.) 
(lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With oil supplies abundant and gasoline cheaper than bottled
water, consumers are unlikely to feel any immediate impact from a
merger of Exxon and Mobil, the United States' two biggest oil
companies, industry executives and some consumer groups contended
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They expect antitrust regulators to insist that the combined
Exxon-Mobil sell off some operations to keep it from using its
considerably increased bulk to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination in and of itself won't have any impact,'' said
Robert Hanfling, a Washington consultant and former Energy
Department official. In fact, he and others argued, the deal may
ultimately prove beneficial to consumers if it leads to stronger
exploration efforts that ensure a plentiful supply of oil in
future.
</P>
<P>
   But at the gasoline pump, some people were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll put their marketing skills together and get as much
for their gasoline as the market will bear,'' said Carl Fischer, a
Dallas motorist.
</P>
<P>
   And Aaron Manning, a New York City cabdriver, saw only dire
consequences as he bought gasoline at an Exxon station in
Manhattan. ``It's going to be a monopoly and it's going to drive
the price up,'' he insisted. ``We will have to pay whatever they
put here.'' And if gasoline prices go up, he said, he wants cab
fares to follow, but he doubts that they will.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent views underline the suspicions that some consumers
have of increasing giant companies, and the ambivalence that even
some in the industry have, although oil executives argue that a
bigger, more efficient oil giant should benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles DiBona, former head of the American Petroleum Institute,
the main trade association for large oil companies, said the
Exxon-Mobil deal would give the combined company more muscle to
negotiate with foreign governments for drilling rights or to build
offshore platforms costing $1 billion. That, in turn, should help
keep prices under control when demand picks up.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hilliard, president of a small oil company in Lafayette,
La., agreed. The Exxon-Mobil deal is ``good for consumers, at least
in the short term,'' he said, partly because he expected the
combined company would find it easier to make a profit despite
persistently low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But those low prices, and more efficient giant oil corporations,
are likely to put more pressure on small companies like his
family-owned Badger Oil Corp. ``We'd rather that at $9 a barrel,
they were losing money,'' Hilliard said, since that would force the
big oil companies to consider curbing production.
</P>
<P>
   Others who see their businesses threatened by oil-industry
consolidation include Emanuel Silvia, a service-station operator in
North Truro, Mass. ``I think eventually they're all headed to do
away with people like myself _ push us little guys out of
business,'' said Silvia, proprietor of Sonny's Gulf. ``Exxon's
going to have more buying power. They'll control the market and the
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups expressed concerns whether regulators would
over the longer term be able to restrain the market power of a
colossus like the combined Exxon-Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the antitrust authorities fail to block a merger between
the No. 1 and No. 2 United States oil companies, it will
predictably lead to more mergers and an even higher level of
industry concentration,'' leaders of two groups founded by Ralph
Nader said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed merger will predictably raise consumer prices,
especially in the many areas where Exxon and Mobil compete
directly,'' contended James Love, director of the Consumer Project
on Technology, and Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential
Action.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians also weighed in, seizing a seemingly irresistible
chance to suggest that it might be a mistake to permit partial
restoration of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co., which was
broken up in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, the state where Rockefeller began his
career, said he would ask the Federal Trade Commission to delay its
decision on another pending industry combination, that of British
Petroleum and Amoco, which company officials have said they hope to
complete by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, called the
Exxon-Mobil deal ``worrisome'' and said it would be wrong for the
FTC to consider either proposal in isolation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal,
said he would investigate the merger proposal and help lead a
multistate inquiry in cooperation with federal authorities to make
sure that it does not stifle competition. Blumenthal is chairman of
the antitrust committee of the National Association of Attorneys
General.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and industry officials agreed that the dominance
of a combined Exxon-Mobil in local areas was far more important
than its overall size nationally, since motorists _ particularly if
their tanks are low _ can drive only so far for a fill-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is truly local,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director
of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ``This deal should not
go forward without a divestiture in markets where there would be
high concentrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kimmelman said he was not as upset by the prospect of an
Exxon-Mobil combination as he was with pending deals in the
telecommunications industry, which he said should be blocked
``absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of
America, expressed even less concern, acknowledging that market
forces _ not companies or OPEC _ determine the price of crude oil,
and that technology can bring it from increasingly deep levels
under the sea and permits far greater drilling accuracy onshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a triumph of economics over the politics of monopoly''
that a deal of such magnitude as Exxon-Mobil could be considered,
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   DiBona, retired head of the American Petroleum Institute, said
the merger would have minimal impact, if any, on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry, he said, ``is not a concentrated industry.''
He pointed to competition from independent competition at every
stage, from Hunt Oil exploring in Yemen to Cumberland Farms
retailing gasoline in New England. ``There's always new people
coming into this market, that's what keeps it highly
unconcentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   And back at the gas pump, some consumers doubted prices would
rise as a result of the Exxon-Mobil merger, but they were more
worried about the workers. ``I don't think it's going to affect us
at the pump,'' said Frank Ross, at Mobil station in Chicago.
``Unfortunately, because of the merger some people are probably
going to lose their jobs.''

JUDGE ORDERS OLYMPIAN'S PARENTS TO KEEP AWAY FROM COUPLE WHO
BEFRIENDED HER. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the lastest twist to &UR;  &LR; an increasingly bizarre feud, a family
court judge signed a temporary restraining order Tuesday keeping
the parents of Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu away from a
couple who befriended her.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu were ordered to stay away from Brian
and Marcy Huggins, not to threaten the couple or to hire private
investigators to watch them.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggins, 32, provided construction equipment to build the
Moceanu gym in 1996 and helped Dominique get away from her parents'
Spring, Texas, home Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame things have gotten this far out of control with
people being threatened and people being stalked,'' Huggins said in
the Harris County Family Law Center while waiting with Dominique
and his attorney for the order to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu said Monday that Houston police told her Nov.
13 that her father had negotiated with a man to kill Huggins and
her coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26. Miscenco, who was in Las Vegas
and not available for comment, also helped Dominique in her escape
from home. Dominique was granted a temporary protective order
Monday keeping her father away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, Huggins and his attorney Mike Moriarty, said they met
with Houston police Tuesday. They declined to discuss details of
the police investigation into the alleged threats but said the case
remains open for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although HPD spokesman Robert Hurst said Monday that the
investigation was closed for lack of evidence, Tuesday he said
``the case is being evaluated ... based on information brought
forth'' during the meeting between investigators, Huggins, Moriarty
and Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst declined to provide details of the investigation. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Dumitru Moceanu has denied he was involved in any
murder-for-hire plot and says he has not harassed his daughter or
Huggins. The Moceanus were not present for either court proceeding
this week. Dominique's and the Huggins' request for temporary
protection were granted solely on the basis of affidavits they
filed.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Huggins said he believes he has ``been under
constant surveillance by people who (sic) I believe were hired by
Dumitru Moceanu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Camelia Moceanu is under the control and
direction of Dumitru Moceanu in their endeavor to wreak havoc on my
family and associates of her daughter, Dominique,'' the affidavit
said. ``I ... feel that the potential for bodily harm is as real
against my wife and my child as it is in the threats and the
activities of Dumitru against my person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huggins are intervening in Dominique's case and both
requests for a permanent restraining order will be heard Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanu's attorney Katherine Scardino said her clients have
a right to be concerned about Huggins because they believe Huggins
and Dominique, 17, are sexually involved.
</P>
<P>
   She said police told her that Huggins and Dominique were
recently in the Cayman Islands together and, ``I can only assume,
our contention is they did have a little thing going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think an adult thinking about it could come to any
other conclusion,'' she said. ``A 32-year-old married guy with a
child hanging around girls and a gym, and a parent is not supposed
to get upset about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said Scardino's comments are false and typical of the
slanderous statements Dumitru has been making about him. His wife
echoed the sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins confirmed that he and Dominique went into hiding at a
tropical island after finding out about the alleged plot to kill
him, but denied that they are sexually involved. He said they did
not initially plan to go to the island but did so after being
offered free accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said HPD officers told her to extend her trip for
safety reasons. She said her parents' accusations are absurd and
``pretty sad.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: HANKERING FOR A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tom Hanks will have some explaining to do before we
elect him president.
</P>
<P>
   We'll want to know if he enjoyed wearing that dress in ``Bosom
Buddies.'' We'll want to know exactly what happened under the
blanket with that stewardess in ``Nothing in Common.'' We'll want
to know what possessed the man who went to the moon to moon in the
December Vogue. We'll want to know whether he is truly contrite
about making ``Turner and Hooch.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, he would have definite assets as a
candidate. He served in World War II, Vietnam and the Peace Corps.
He brought Apollo 13 back safely. He learned about suffering in
``Philadelphia.'' He got that magic handshake from JFK in ``Forrest
Gump.'' And he has a catchy campaign slogan: ``Life is like a box
of chocolates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeepers, creepers, as Hanks likes to say, why not? In Washington
we've had no one to root for in a very long time. A faux hero would
be better than no hero. We have a groupie for president. Why not
have a star?
</P>
<P>
   Hanks made big news this week when he dissed his pal the
president in The New Yorker, noting that there was a time, after
Clinton confessed about Monica, when he regretted giving money to
the Clinton defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   He also mused about running, e-mailing the writer Kurt Anderson:
``The actual ideology that anyone can glean as projected by my
appearances on TV is good because we are all so different and
respecting each other is not so hard a thing to do. Not a bad
platform, I suppose, to run for some office.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his comments caused a sensation, with some TV reporters
acting as though he held the fate of the Democratic Party in his
hands, Hanks showed his true potential as a pol. He gave the
illusion of backpedaling. He stressed he was still a fervent
Clinton supporter, but noted, ``for a moment or so I might have
questioned my original intentions'' in giving to the legal fund.
</P>
<P>
   A slap from Tom Hanks must sting the president more than a slap
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before, it was pols who lectured Hollywood about setting a bad
moral example. Now an actor renowned as a decent guy and cozy
family man was lecturing Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking reversal. It used to be that Hollywood was
drawn to Washington's issues, and Washington to Hollywood's sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, stars looked on politicians as fundamentally more
serious than them, but now they consider politicians just as
superficial and cynical as anyone else,'' said Ron Brownstein, the
L.A. Times columnist who wrote ``The Power and the Glitter.''
``Politicians now get into the type of sex scandals stars used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Drenched in celebrity, Washington has adopted the code of the
entertainment capital: If you're famous enough, the rules don't
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton completed the merger of show biz and politics begun
by Joe Kennedy, impresario of illusion and glamour, and continued
by Ronald Reagan. His White House is all about ratings, and
Hollywood types respect his ability to defy the critics and
consistently get boffo box office.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood will soon realize: Why give millions to prop up
Democratic candidates when it can field its own?
</P>
<P>
   With President Hanks, at least the stars sleeping in the Lincoln
Bedroom would be real friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a New Yorker piece last February called
``Entertainer-in-Chief,'' Anderson wrote that ``politics has become
a kind of low-production-value sub-genre of show business, engaging
only when it is entertaining.'' He wrote that Clinton benefited
from the Lewinsky affair the same way a tired TV drama does when it
adds a bizarre new plot twist in the sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniel, a Hollywood producer, drolly confirms the
synthesis: ``You see the lust Dick Morris and Chris Matthews have
to be on TV, and it's as if they're on `Hollywood Squares.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ross, a writer-director whose hits include ``Big,''
``Dave'' and ``Pleasantville,'' agreed: ``When you see how good
Henry Hyde is at farce, why shouldn't Tom Hanks go into politics?
He's our Jimmy Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has increased our appetite for entertainment
to the point where we may not even be satisfied with Tom Hanks the
person. We may need to go all the way and elect Tom Hanks the
character.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Even if the Denver Broncos win back-to-back Super Bowls and become
the first NFL team to finish 19-0, they will not be recognized as
the greatest team of all time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the greatest, but not the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos will be the greatest team of their era, but in this
age of a watered-down league in which expansion has diluted the
talent, and free agency and the salary cap allow players to switch
teams like mercenaries, they will not be recognized as superior to
such dynasties as Green Bay in the 1960s, Pittsburgh in the 1970s,
San Francisco in the 1980s and Dallas in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, are the Broncos better than the 1985 Chicago Bears,
who finished 18-1 and dominated the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are trying to join the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the
only unbeaten and untied champions in NFL history. But don't call
that Dolphins team the greatest ever. During the regular season,
Miami beat only two teams that finished with winning records _ the
Chiefs and Giants, both of whom were 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year, if we're 19-0, there's no reason you
wouldn't consider this team one of the better teams in history, if
not the greatest,'' Denver owner Pat Bowlen says.
</P>
<P>
   With four games left _ against Kansas City, the New York Giants,
Miami and Seattle _ the Broncos could end the regular season 16-0.
They could be 18-0 entering Super Bowl XXXIII and lose to the
Minnesota Vikings, who might be as good or better.
</P>
<P>
   After beating San Diego 31-16 on Sunday when they overcame four
turnovers, including three interceptions by John Elway, the Broncos
became only the fourth 12-0 team in NFL history and the first since
the 1985 Bears.
</P>
<P>
   As the Broncos move closer to their rendezvous with destiny,
they are analyzed more and more by the so-called experts who want
to carve their place in history. The Broncos' mediocre first-half
performance at San Diego is being used as an example that this
Denver team is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All great teams have bad games, but they find a way to win,''
Bowlen says.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have found ways to win decisively. They haven't come
close to losing. In this age of last-second miracles, Denver has
been boring.
</P>
<P>
   The closest any team has come to beating Denver was Oct. 11 at
Seattle, where the Broncos won 21-16. The five-point victory was
their closest game of the season. They beat New England 27-21 and
Cincinnati 33-26.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has beaten four teams that have winning records _ New
England, Dallas, Oakland and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit for them,'' San Diego linebacker Junior
Seau says. ``Their offensive attack is balanced. They have two Hall
of Fame players (Elway and running back Terrell Davis). This is
their year.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos beat Kansas City at Mile High Stadium on Sunday,
they will tie an NFL record with their 18th consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos clinched the AFC West title against the Chargers. If
they defeat the Chiefs, they will earn the home-field advantage
throughout the AFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Broncos were the best team in the AFC,
securing the home-field advantage Dec. 1. Coach Mike Shanahan
rested his best players at times over the last few games. Then, in
the second round at Mile High Stadium, they were upset by
Jacksonville. Shanahan learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a situation like it was two years
ago,'' Shanahan says. ``I don't think it takes a genius to figure
out what we learned. We got our butts kicked by Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play each game, and we're not going to hold
back. We're going out there and playing each game to win,
regardless if we win out and regardless if we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Broncos winning and winning decisively is the
offense. They are the NFL's highest-scoring team, averaging 33.4
points per game. They have scored fewer than 27 points only once,
in the win at Seattle. They have scored at least 30 points in nine
games, at least 40 in three.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is third in the NFL in total offense (379.8 yards per
game) and first in rushing (162.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, they may be as good as I've seen in the 20 years
I've been around this league,'' Chargers coach June Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is an offensive genius, but he's blessed with such
outstanding coaches as offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and
offensive line coach Alex Gibbs. Davis leads the NFL in rushing and
touchdowns and is the leading candidate to be named the league's
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, of course, is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego game was an example of how good Elway can be.
Having thrown only three interceptions all season entering the
game, he threw three in the second quarter, but Denver still led
21-10 at halftime. He finished with four touchdown passes, giving
him seven in his past two games since returning from a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's John Elway, a Hall of Fame quarterback,'' San
Diego safety Rodney Harrison says. ``His confidence doesn't get
shattered. He threw three interceptions, and he was laughing on the
field. Hey, Denver's a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway might get frustrated over the nagging injuries that have
cost him four starts this season, but he never panics or loses his
poise in pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not always going to go smooth for us, and we know
that,'' Elway says. ``We're ready for a battle every time we go out
there, and if we make a mistake, we're able to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of making the plays you have to make. There's so
much character on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's offense is so good, reserve quarterback Bubby Brister
is 4-0 in games he has started in place of the injured Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense doesn't get a lot of respect, because it isn't
loaded with stars and doesn't rank among the league leaders. The
Broncos are 12th in total defense, third against the run and 20th
in pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   But when Elway was struggling against the Chargers, Denver's
defense forced six turnovers, including five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple ugly parts of the game, but I don't think
there was ever any doubt as to what the outcome would be,'' Broncos
defensive end Harald Hasselbach says. ``Every interception they
made, we came back with one of our own. That's what has made this
team so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have outstanding special teams. Their return teams
are awesome, their coverage teams are good, and the kicking game is
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   And the Broncos are an experienced team. Of the 53-man roster,
22 players are 30 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``They find a way to win,'' Seau says. ``When they don't play a
perfect game, they still win. That's the key to playing in this
league. When they stumble, they get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   In their final four games, the Broncos have two chances to
stumble, according to those closest to the team. They visit the
Giants and the Dolphins. The Miami game Dec. 21 is on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Chiefs and Seahawks visit Mile High Stadium, where
the Broncos have been invincible over the past two seasons, they
don't stand much chance of pulling an upset. The Broncos are trying
not to look beyond Kansas City, one of their fiercest rivals. They
want to sweep the Chiefs and earn the home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be good to know you're going to be at home in the
playoffs, but two years ago we had the same scenario and we lost at
home,'' Denver receiver Rod Smith says. ``Hell, I would have rather
lost on the road. You could have something to blame it on.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1977, the Broncos beat their four AFC
West rivals on the road. Shanahan doesn't want conquests like that
to go for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the playoffs, he says: ``If we play well
(Sunday), we will get a week's rest right before (the first
playoff) game. That's plenty of time. Hopefully, we'll do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got that bye week to rest. We did it the hard way last
year (making the playoffs as a wild card) with no rest, and we were
still able to win four in a row, three on the road. So we are going
to play it just like we did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each game, we'll go in to win and hope that's good enough.''

FRIENDS AND FOES OF GUN CONTROL UNHAPPY WITH NEW BRADY LAW
PROVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New federal regulations requiring buyers of
virtually all types of firearms to undergo instant background
checks went into effect this week, and gun control groups, privacy
advocates and the National Rifle Association found themselves
complaining about the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a hybrid system which doesn't entirely satisfy the
NRA's concerns,'' said Robert Walker, president of the gun control
organization, Handgun Control Inc., ``nor does it satisfy ours.''
</P>
<P>
   While each side also finds much to like in the new rules, the
NRA has gone to court to block a new federal database of gun
purchases, and gun control groups are lamenting the end of waiting
periods. They each plan to lobby the new Congress for changes when
it convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were mandated by the Brady Law, federal legislation
named after James Brady, former President Reagan's press secretary
who was critically injured in a 1981 assassination attempt on
Reagan. President Clinton has often called the measure one of his
major crime-fighting achievements, boasting that it has prevented
more than 250,000 handguns from being purchased by felons.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1993, the law required handgun buyers to undergo a
check of their backgrounds and wait five days before taking
possession of their guns. But starting on Nov. 30, the waiting
period was dropped, and the FBI was required to set up a national
computerized system that would allow for instant checks into the
background of potential buyers. In addition, the law automatically
expanded to cover purchases of rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is set up to prevent guns from going to people you
and I don't want to have them _ convicted felons, drug dealers,
illegal aliens and people who are adjudicated mentally deficient,''
said Jeff Roehm, chief of public affairs for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of a purchase, gun dealers must now call an 800
telephone number that hooks into two calling centers _ one in
Moundsville, W.Va., another in Uniontown, Pa. _ run by private
companies under FBI contracts totaling $42 million. Workers at the
centers will check a national FBI database to determine if the
customer should be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   A person can be disqualified if he or she has been arrested for
a felony, or for a misdemeanor involving domestic violence, has
been committed by a court to a mental institution, has been
dishonorably discharged from the military, is an illegal alien or
has renounced U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   If a potential buyer is disqualified on the first check, the FBI
has three business days to conduct a more thorough search to
determine the details of the reasons, checking, for example, to see
if the felony arrest actually resulted in a conviction. If the
bureau turns up nothing untoward, the purchase is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But as the new system was placed on line and weathered the
technical glitches of a start-up, both pro- and anti-gun people
found fault.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the five-day waiting period had prevented some
crimes of passion. He added that the waiting period allowed local
police agencies to search records that might not be in the FBI's
national database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt that as far we can see into the future there
are certain pieces of information that are unlikely to be included
in any kind of national background check,'' Walker said. ``So the
waiting period would serve as both a cooling off period and a time
when other people can have input.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said his organization would lobby the next Congress to
have the waiting period reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   NRA leaders say they also intend to lobby Congress to revise the
bill, only this time the aim would be to remove rifles and shotguns
from the list of weapons that trigger a background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, for a number of reasons, starting with the work load,
the monetary savings and the fact that they have not been proved to
be a problem, we ought to look at scaling the law down and knocking
out rifles and shotguns,'' said Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The group filed suit Tuesday in federal court seeking to stop
the FBI from keeping a database of the firearm purchases for which
it provides background checks. The bureau had sought to keep a
record of the transactions for six months in order to conduct
audits to determine if gun dealers were following the law and to
check for fraud and abuse of the system.
</P>
<P>
   But the NRA contends the Brady Law specifically bans the federal
government from retaining records and keeping what the group
contends is a central registry of gun purchases. The NRA is joined
in this assertion by some privacy groups.

STEINEM GROUP BUYS MS. MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what some might describe as a triumph of poetic justice and
others as a last-ditch attempt to save a magazine some consider no
longer relevant, Ms. magazine has been sold to a new media group
founded by the magazine's original editor and co-founder, Gloria
Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald Communications Corp., a business communications
company, announced the sale Tuesday. The buyer is Liberty Media for
Women, a group of around a dozen women that was cobbled together by
Ms. Steinem from her network of feminist movers and shakers. The
group includes Steinem and the current Ms. editor, Marcia Ann
Gillespie, along with women like Sandy Lerner, a founder of Cisco
Systems, the computer-networking company, who with her husband is
worth more than $200 million; Martha Crowninshield, managing
director of the venture capital firm Boston Ventures; Alix Ritchie,
publisher of The Provincetown Banner; and Abby Disney, a
philanthropist and grand-niece of Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Jay MacDonald, chief executive of MacDonald Communications, had
closed down Ms. operations in September, leaving the editorial
staff in a state of employment limbo. He bought Ms. _ along with
Working Woman and Working Mother _ from the Lang Communications
Corp. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steinem and her group have been struggling to put together
enough money to buy the magazine. A person involved in the deal
said the price was $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. began in 1972 as an opinion leader for the women's movement.
In its premiere issue, several prominent women revealed that they
had undergone abortions, while it was still illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But as activist feminism ceded to the success of the corporate
woman, the Ms. mission has lost some of its urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation has dropped from 540,000 in 1989 to a current,
unaudited 200,000. There is no ad revenue because in 1990 the
magazine adopted a no-advertising policy, to assure editorial
independence. The magazine depends on newsstand sales _ at $5.95 an
issue _ and subscriptions for its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steinem and the women of Liberty Media face an enormous
challenge: making Ms. relevant to younger women in an age when many
women in their 20s and 30s choose not to describe themselves as
feminists. Katie Roiphe, the 30-year-old author of ``The Morning
After: Sex, Fear and Feminism,'' said she found Ms.
``old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that Ms. magazine is something of a dinosaur and
that it has outlived its relevance,'' Ms. Roiphe said. ``It has
failed to move with time and to incorporate different and
interesting opinions. It has remained this dogmatic, old-fashioned,
humorless publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms., a holdover from the era when a magazine was just a
magazine, was out of place in MacDonald's synergistic company. He
said he wanted to attract more women in business who were willing
to attend seminars and pay membership fees to organizations he
runs, like the National Association of Female Executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says we're a bad fit, and he's right,'' Ms. Steinem said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. has had a string of owners since New York magazine sponsored
the first issue, and Ms. Steinem said she was relieved to have it
back under both her editorial and financial control. (She owned a
third of the stock for a brief time in the 1970s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first cover said Spring 1972, because it was
supposed to be on the newsstand for three months,'' Ms. Steinem
said. ``But it sold out in eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Communications put up $1 million for start-up costs.
After 1979, Ms. operated as a tax-exempt foundation, supported by
grants and contributions. In 1987, Fairfax Communications _ the
owners of Sassy magazine _ bought Ms. And in 1990, Lang
Communications Corp. purchased it.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Lang was $15 million in debt, and MacDonald
Communications bought Ms., along with the other two titles. The
sale to Liberty was reported Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought seriously about whether the world still needs Ms.
magazine,'' Ms. Steinem said. ``And I went out and picked up
armloads of women's magazines and I looked at them and I thought:
`Yes. The world does still need Ms. magazine.'''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CARRY-ON LUGGAGE LIMITS; SHRINKING VACATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ariz., Colo.)  (Also moved in ``t'' category.)

<P>
   Until recently, the baggage ``sizers'' used at airports to
determine whether luggage can be carried aboard planes or must be
checked were often little more than adornments. But increasing
emphasis on on-time performance has led many airlines to draw a
harder line against oversized carry-on luggage, contending that it
shortchanges other passengers, slows the boarding process and leads
to costly flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, UAL's United Airlines has installed sizers at
airports in New York (La Guardia), Los Angeles and Chicago
(O'Hare), and plans to install them at 37 more. ``At first, 20
percent of our passengers at those airports had to check the bags
they wanted to carry on,'' said Tony Molinaro, a United spokesman.
``Now it's down to 2 to 3 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines is testing sizers at Los Angeles, San Diego
and Phoenix _ also with apparent high compliance, perhaps because
it notified its frequent fliers before the new regulations went
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Continental Airlines dislikes sizers, so much so that last
week it sued in California Superior Court to prohibit Delta Air
Lines, which operates the baggage sizer that it shares with
Continental and America West at the San Diego airport, from
imposing its baggage policies on Continental passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Continental also warned United and Denver International Airport
not to install sizers at the three security checkpoints controlled
by United and used by other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision to invest almost $15 million to retrofit
our planes with expanded overhead bins,'' said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman. ``And rather than tell customers what they
can't do, our policy will be to explain our guidelines and decide
for ourselves if carry-on items will fit. You can have both heavy
loads and good on-time performance.''
</P>
<P>
   United, meanwhile, is adding the deeper bins to its entire
Shuttle by United fleet, and expects to have them in all 50 planes
within the next few months. But, Molinaro said, the airline is
continuing to install sizers at the other 37 airports. Delta has
sizers in six airports, but has not yet decided whether to install
them in others.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Shorter Vacations
</P>
<P>
   With their hectic schedules, the best many workers can manage is
a few days off now and then. But once their work schedules lighten,
they can take that lengthy, restful vacation they've dreamed about.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. According to a recent World Tourism
Organization study, global competition has resulted in longer
working hours for many employees, suggesting that leisure time is
likely to decline for many people, thus accelerating the trend to
shorter, more frequent vacations.

BOEING TO CUT OUTPUT OF AIRLINERS; LOWERS EARNINGS PROJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. said Tuesday that the economic downturn in Asia was
forcing it to scale back production of many passenger jets
beginning next year and to cut more jobs over the next two years _
perhaps as many as 20,000 _ than it had indicated in June.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and
the nation's largest exporter, also said that its 1999 earnings
would be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, lower than the
already greatly reduced estimate of $2 billion it gave investors
last summer. Operating margins in 2000 would be even lower than
1999, the company predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Boeing is still struggling to recover
from a disastrous decision in 1996 to raise airplane production to
record levels in order to meet booming demand from the world's
airlines. The company ended up taking $4 billion in accounting
charges and posting its first annual loss in 50 years in 1997 after
its factories buckled under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is still committed to delivering 550 planes this year and
a record 620 in 1999. Workers toiled through the Thanksgiving
holiday to finish jets before the end of the year even as the
company has been desperately trying to reduce its staffing from a
June high of 238,000 in order to bolster profits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had previously estimated that it would eliminate as many
as 28,000 jobs by the end of next year. Tuesday it said it would
increase that estimate to as high as 38,000 and for the first time
added that it expected to cut as many as 10,000 additional
positions by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Lawrence McCracken said the company had not yet
worked out the specific details of which jobs will be eliminated.
But he said that the reductions would come from all over the
Seattle-based company, from the factory floor to the headquarters
suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the cuts will be handled through attrition,'' he said,
``but at those levels not all of them.'' Boeing currently loses
about 5 percent of its employees each year due to attrition, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Machinists, which represents
40,000 Boeing workers and will begin contract negotiations next
summer, lashed out at the company Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what we have going into negotiations, then we're in
for some trouble,'' said Bill Johnson, president of the Boeing
local.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the job cuts were overdue and should go
deeper because Boeing, which has been slow to modernize its
production methods, produces less revenue per employee than its
main competitor, the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   But others were disappointed that Boeing was trimming its profit
forecasts for 1999 and 2000 after shocking investors in July, when
it announced estimates that were one-third lower than the forecasts
of most analysts at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the basic goal was to move the numbers down last
summer so you could give people a positive surprise,'' said
Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann had been a leading bear on Boeing stock until the last
few months, when he began recommending it in the belief that the
company was turning itself around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like they were slowly getting it wired back
together,'' he said. ``It ain't quite working the way we thought it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobs, an aerospace analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, Inc.,
an investment banking and brokerage firm in Seattle, said he was
heartened that Boeing had confirmed its delivery targets for this
year and next and that the company finally seemed to be making a
realistic assessment of the damage caused by the recession in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it would cut production of its 747 jumbo jet to two
a month from 3.5 a month in late 1999 and might even cut production
to one a month in early 2000 if demand does not pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The 747, the largest commercial airplane on the market, is most
popular on Asian routes and is also Boeing's most profitable model
because, after 30 years in production, its development costs have
long since been written off.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also said that in early 2000 it will cut production of
the single-aisle 757 to four airplanes a month from five a month
and production of the wide-body 767 to 3.5 a month from four a
month. Production of the wide-body 777, which had been scheduled to
be reduced to five a month from seven a month late next year and
then return to seven a month in 2,000, will stay at five a month,
the company said.

   Prince, a 6-foot-8 freshman, is the starting shooting guard for
the defending national champs, averaging 8.7 points and shooting
47.8 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   He's keeping a low profile on the court, shooting when open and
careful not to exceed his rookie role. But when Kentucky needs a
spark, as it did Saturday against UCLA, Prince is happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team needs somebody to give us a lift, I can hit a
couple shots to get us started,'' Prince said last week during the
Puerto Rico Shootout. ``I'm starting to feel more comfortable.
Since I'm starting, I'm trying to create something so we don't put
it all on the seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince's performance against the Bruins _ 11 points, including
eight in the second half _ was especially rewarding for his family.
Five years ago, his brother, Tommie, was set to attend UCLA until
his standardized test score was challenged and the Bruins abruptly
ended their recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie is now a senior at Pepperdine, but his younger brother
never forgave the Bruins. During his recruitment last year, he kept
UCLA on his short list so he could ultimately reject them as they
rejected his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never going to attend UCLA,'' he said with a scowl. ``I
was (angry with) them, the whole family was (angry with) them for
what happened to Tommie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde's fan club: Houston coach Clyde Drexler hasn't proven he
can recruit anyone but sons of former NBA stars (Gee Gervin, Moses
Malone Jr.). He hadn't proven he can coach, and he's almost two
years short of his degree.
</P>
<P>
   But Drexler can sell tickets. Within three months of his hiring
last March, Houston sold 4,200 season tickets. Its current total
(6,800) is a school record and five times greater than last year.
</P>
<P>
   More, the Cougars have added 24 luxury suites to the top
concourse of Hofheinz Pavilion and sold 23 of them _ for $15,000
each, with a three-year commitment. In addition, they've sold 261
courtside seats for $1,000 each. That's $1.3 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a guy who has won three college games, including
Monday's 67-55 victory over downtrodden Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler has surrounded himself with former Phi Slamma Jamma
teammates Reid Gettys (assistant coach) and Michael Young (strength
coach). So far, he hasn't hired my favorite Phi guy, Benny Anders,
who was last spotted playing pro ball in South America. Anders in
the Andies?
</P>
<P>
   Drexler gets his first chance at a legitimate victory Thursday
at California.
</P>
<P>
   Head of their class: So far, the nation's best freshman is
DePaul's Quentin Richardson, who leads the nation in rebounding
with a 13.8 average. He's also scoring 24.5 points per game and
shooting 55.7 percent from the field. The 6-foot-6 Richardson has
35 offensive rebounds for the 3-1 Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke's Elton Brand (15.8 points, 11.3 rebounds) looms over
the sophomore class like a 260-pound chandelier, its most improved
member is North Carolina center Brendan Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood had six blocks in the NIT finals against Stanford and
he's averaging 12.6 points and 7.6 rebounds for the unbeaten Tar
Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned our inside game around,'' Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   If he stays in school through his junior year and continues
developing, Haywood may be the No.1 pick in the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: The most impressive newcomer, by far, is USC
forward Brian Scalabrine, from Highline Community College in Des
Moines, Wash. Scalabrine is big, skilled, athletic and plays with
limitless energy.
</P>
<P>
   One newcomer to watch is Oregon guard Alex Scales, from San
Jacinto (Texas) Junior College. He had 14 points and 10 rebounds in
a recent victory over Southern Illinois....
</P>
<P>
   And don't be fooled by Oregon's 72-61 loss at Minnesota on
Monday. The Ducks were good enough to build a 14-point halftime
lead, and that signals trouble for anyone visiting Mac Court this
season....
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin and Pepperdine's Lorenzo Romar have a
sensational learning opportunity Saturday in the Wooden Classic,
when they face Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton and Kansas' Roy
Williams, respectively....
</P>
<P>
   Washington had a tough trip to Chicago for its Great Eight game
against Connecticut on Tuesday. The Huskies played Friday through
Sunday in the Big Island Invitational, then flew straight from
Hawaii to Chicago....
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's most impressive freshman doesn't wear UCLA blue (or
black). He's Arizona power forward Michael Wright, who had 21
points and seven rebounds at Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike teammate Gene Edgerson, Wright doesn't use his elbows
to make an impact. If you missed it, Edgerson flattened BYU's Bret
Jepsen with the worst cheap shot seen around these parts in years.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats coach Lute Olson benched Edgerson, but because no foul
was called _ the refs didn't see it _ the Pac-10 probably won't
issue a suspension. Too bad. &QL;

GIULIANI AGREES TO LET PANEL EVALUATE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After striving to overhaul the city's troubled child
welfare agency for nearly three years, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
agreed to let a panel of national experts assess the agency's
performance and issue recommendations and timetables for improving
abuse investigations, foster care placements and the pace of
adoptions, lawyers close to the agreement say.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which resolves a class-action lawsuit filed by
lawyers seeking a court takeover of the agency, also requires state
officials to conduct nine audits of the agency and to assign 41
workers to monitor city compliance with state law.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which was signed by city and state officials
Tuesday, sets the stage for extraordinary independent scrutiny of
the Administration for Children's Services over the next two years.
It comes three years after the beating death of a 6-year-old, Elisa
Izquierdo, at her mother's hands, shocked the city into instituting
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   And it reflects, for the first time, a tacit acknowledgement
that child welfare officials still need guidance and that state
officials still need to improve their monitoring of the city's
oversight of abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   But the pact also represents a significant victory for Giuliani.
The lawyers for foster children, who filed their suit in 1995,
backed away from their call for a court takeover. And the expert
panel, which will assess the agency, cannot compel the city to
follow its directives. It can only find that the city has acted in
bad faith, which would allow the advocates for children to renew
their litigation, using the experts as their witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   This novel approach marks a stark departure from other child
welfare settlements across the country, which typically require
localities to follow strict, court-ordered mandates.
</P>
<P>
   But child welfare experts have increasingly argued that such
agreements rarely produce change on their own. New York City, for
instance, has never come close to complying with the dictates of
the Wilder Settlement of 1986, which was intended to insure that
foster children went to proper homes.
</P>
<P>
   And the lawyers for children now seem to be gambling that a less
restrictive agreement may have a better chance of success,
particularly if it has the support of Giuliani and his child
welfare commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta. Consequently, the
advocates also agreed to dissolve the Wilder Settlement and to bar
for two years the filing of any class-action lawsuits on behalf of
children now in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has proven so resistant to change that we really
had to be very clear-minded about what was likely to result,'' said
Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children's Rights,
the advocacy group that filed the initial lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a trial is not that difficult,'' Ms. Lowry said.
``What is difficult is getting things to change. And this agreement
is going to bring about reform that is long overdue.''

LAWSUIT AGAINST DRUG MAKERS IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After more than nine weeks of testimony, a federal
judge here dismissed a class-action lawsuit that accused four major
drug makers of conspiring to fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that evidence of a conspiracy was ``meager'' to
``nonexistent,'' U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras threw out the
case against Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Novartis AG, Monsanto Co. and
Forest Laboratories, and a group of drug wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which had been brought by more than 40,000 pharmacies
across the United States, accused the drug makers of conspiring to
fix prices by creating a dual pricing system that gave discounts to
health-care providers and health-management organizations but not
to retail pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury heard more than nine weeks of testimony and
depositions, however, lawyers for the defendants made a motion for
dismissal, and it was granted. Kocoras said on Monday that the
accusations made were not supported by evidence presented at the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   John Treece, a lawyer for the drug makers, said the finding was
a clear vindication of the discounting policies used by many drug
companies. Perry Goldberg, a lawyer for the pharmacies, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the pharmacies are expected to appeal the decision,
however, and drug manufacturers still face several other major
lawsuits. More than 5,000 pharmacies have also filed a price-fixing
suit in federal court here, and a group of chain stores have also
brought suit.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nation's largest drug makers, including Merck and
Pfizer, were not involved in the suit here. In the last two years,
that larger group agreed to pay more than $700 million to settle
accusations that they engaged in price-fixing.

HOUSTON ISN'T EXPECTED TO FEEL BRUNT OF CUTBACKS FROM EXXON, MOBIL
MERGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While not immune to the cutbacks arising from the merger of
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., Houston is not expected to feel the
brunt of the 9,000 layoffs planned in the wake of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The city may even add jobs, as the new company consolidates the
headquarters of its chemicals and worldwide energy exploration and
production businesses here, some energy executives suggested
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has about 12,825 employees in Houston, including 4,200 at
its Baytown refinery _ the largest concentration of Exxon employees
in the United States. Mobil has about 600 workers in Houston and
2,200 at its refinery and related operations in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials stressed that the expected layoffs will come
from its worldwide work force of 123,000, less than 40 percent of
which is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that we get any pleasure out of,'' said
Mobil Chairman Lucio Noto, who will become vice chairman of the new
company to be named Exxon Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Houston civic leaders expressed hopes that the deal will not
have an adverse effect on the city's already cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, said
he was ``cautiously optimistic'' about how the deal will effect the
Houston economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to know what is going to happen, they have a
lot of regulatory hurdles to go over, but generally speaking the
consolidation in the energy industry has been good for Houston
because companies often move operations here when they
consolidate,'' Kollaer said.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1980s and early 1990s, many energy companies
moved jobs to Houston as they closed offices in Denver, Midland,
Oklahoma City and other energy centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announced $75 billion acquisition of Mobil by Exxon Corp.
will certainly affect the Houston economy,'' said Mayor Lee Brown.
``While both companies have a presence in Houston, of the two,
Exxon has the largest operation here. The fact that they are the
purchaser of Mobil may hopefully result in less shrinking of the
work force and general business operations in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its Baytown refinery, Exxon has 10 other
significant business operations in Houston, including U.S. oil and
gas exploration, its coal and minerals unit, Exxon Yemen, Exxon
Company International Chad Doba, Exxon Production Research and
Exxon Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was formerly home to Exxon's domestic oil and gas
business, but all of its exploration and production operations were
consolidated here in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in merging the exploration and production
operations here will be to get Mobil and Exxon people together to
determine an organizational structure for the newly expanded group,
said Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   Noto could not say how many Mobil exploration and production
employees might be moving here. Mobil has exploration and
production workers in Dallas, Fairfax, Va., and various locations
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will likely see many of its Mobil exploration and
production employees shifted to Houston. The company employs about
2,200 workers in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Noto and Raymond declined to say how many jobs Houston
might gain or lose as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Simmons, president of Simmons &AMP; Co. International, a
Houston-based energy investment banker, said he expects Houston to
be a beneficiary when the two companies move all of their worldwide
oil and gas exploration here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what they spent on (exploration and production) over
the last decade: Exxon spent $48.6 billion and Mobil spent $28.4
billion,'' Simmons said. ``That's a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobil divisions now represented in Houston include
petrochemicals, pipelines, Latin American exploration and
production and natural gas liquids.
</P>
<P>
   Since both companies already have their chemicals operations
headquarters here, it will not be as much of a logistical challenge
to combine those two groups.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's Baytown refinery and Mobil's refinery in Beaumont, two
of the largest in the country, are unlikely to see significant job
cuts, said Ray Ory, president of Vector Associates, a Houston
consulting firm that tracks the refining business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have invested a lot of money maintaining these
refineries, and they are pretty much state-of-the-art,'' Ory said.
</P>
<P>
   Ory does not see the two facilities being integrated in any
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will continue to operate in much the same way
they always have,'' Ory said. ``Any concern about staff reductions
in the refineries is misplaced. The refineries today have very
efficient work forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ory's optimism, employees at the Beaumont, Texas,
facility were still concerned about their future Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers are apprehensive about what might happen, but we're
confident that we have a good, efficient refinery,'' said Melvin
Blackwell, chairman of the workmen's group for Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union Local 4-243, which represents most of the
workers at the Beaumont refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said there will probably be some efficiencies to be
gained at the two refineries. ``I suspect that with two large
refineries, almost by definition there will be some opportunities
for cost reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ory believes jobs in Exxon's and Mobil's marketing,
administration and pipeline businesses and distribution services
for the companies's retail outlets face a much bleaker outlook
because of redundant duties at each company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Noto said they have no idea whether any of the two
companies' physical facilities in Houston will be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Exxon Mobil, while the world's largest oil company,
will not be the largest oil and gas producer in Texas. That
distinction belongs to Altura, the joint venture of Amoco and Shell
Oil Co.'s Permian Basin properties, said David Garlick, director of
research and administration at the Texas Independent Producers and
Royalty Owners Association.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' oil and gas production in Texas has been
declining as they have sold properties off in the past 20 years,
Garlick said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Exxon was the No. 1 oil producer in Texas, pumping
223.7 million barrels of oil. Mobil that year was No. 9, producing
48.6 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Exxon was still No. 2 but was producing only 29. 2
million barrels, and Mobil was No. 6, producing 18.9 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of their market power, the effect of the merger would
have been much larger had it occurred in the past,'' Garlick said. &QL;

ORIOLES LOSE PALMEIRO BUT ADD BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Belle took baseball's most menacing stare and perhaps
most menacing bat to Baltimore on Tuesday in the first of what the
Baltimore Orioles hoped would be a series of moves aimed at
catching the New York Yankees next season. But no sooner had the
Orioles signed Belle than they learned that Rafael Palmeiro was
defecting to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, failing to induce the Chicago White Sox to keep him by
extending his contract or his no-trade clause, signed with the
Orioles for five years and $65 million. Although his presence on
the team _ any team _ is fraught with risk, the Orioles needed a
player of Belle's offensive caliber to keep them competitive.
</P>
<P>
   They had offered Palmeiro $50 million for five years with the
idea of pairing his consistently productive bat in the lineup with
Belle's, but Palmeiro wanted to return to Texas, where he had
played for five years and where he and his family live. The first
baseman, on his initiative, met with Doug Melvin, the Rangers'
general manager, at high noon on Tuesday and left with a five-year,
$45 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Orioles in pursuit of B.J. Surhoff and Robin
Ventura, both of whom have offers from the New York Mets, too. The
Orioles were busy on the trade front as well, acquiring catcher
Charles Johnson from the Mets for Armando Benitez, their closer,
after the Mets obtained Johnson from Los Angeles for Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   By giving Belle a contract that averages $13 million a year,
tying Mike Piazza's income with the Mets for third highest in the
major leagues, Peter Angelos, the owner, went well past his
previously stated limit of $10 million a year for a player's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   But the left fielder's actual salary will be precisely that
amount, $10 million each year, with the remaining $15 million to be
deferred without interest and paid out at $5 million a year in the
three years after the contract ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the activities of these other teams,'' Angelos
said in a telephone interview, explaining the change in his
thinking. ``We decided we couldn't sit on the sidelines, for
example, let Belle become part of that Yankees lineup. We thought
the Yankees would be that much tougher with Belle than with Bernie
Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Before last Wednesday, the Yankees had been talking seriously
with Belle and his agent, Arn Tellem. Then the Orioles jumped in
with their 5-for-65 offer to Belle, and the Yankees decided that if
they were going to have to spend that much to get Belle, they might
as well give it to their own outfielder. In addition, Boston had
made an $87.5 million offer to Williams, and the Yankees did not
want him playing for their archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to make a move,'' Angelos said. ``Our
competition is the Yankees and the Red Sox. I have no intention of
becoming a doormat for the Yankees or the Red Sox. We intend to be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, the Orioles may have raised their offer
to Palmeiro yet again, having just gone from $45 million to $50
million, including $2 million a year deferred without interest. But
after meeting with Melvin, Palmeiro instructed his agent, Jim
Bronner, to negotiate with Baltimore no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the Rangers signed Will Clark to play first base
after Palmeiro did not accept their offer. Now the cycle is
complete as Clark leaves the Rangers. Now the Orioles have lost
Palmeiro, second baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielder Eric Davis
as free agents, and the Atlanta Braves beat them to Brian Jordan,
another free agent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Based on the players' statistics, the addition of Belle and the
subtraction of Palmeiro does not leave the Orioles too far ahead of
the game. Palmeiro, 34, slugged 43 home runs and knocked in 121
runs last season. It was the fourth successive season in which he
hit at least 38 home runs and drove in 104 runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight seasons Belle has hit more home runs (313) and
driven in more runs (979) than any other player, and after the
All-Star Game break last season he was awesome, batting .387,
hitting 31 home runs and driving in 86 runs in 76 games. He
finished at .328, with 49 homers and 152 rbi, and led the American
League in slugging percentage and extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen this guy absolutely intimidate young pitchers just
by standing there looking at them with eye-to-eye contact,'' Ray
Miller, the Orioles' manager, said at a news conference at Camden
Yards.
</P>
<P>
   But some people in baseball expect that life with Belle could be
potentially dangerous for Miller, whose tenure in Baltimore is
tenuous. As great a hitter as the 32-year-old Belle has been, he
has also been a problem, incurring a series of suspensions and
attention from the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trouble seems to find him,'' Ron Schueler, the White Sox
general manager, said by telephone from Chicago. But he quickly
added the loftiest of laudatory words about his now former player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he came to the ball park, there was nobody any better,''
Schueler said. ``He does not give up any at-bats; he studies films.
When he takes the field, he wants to win. When he gets to the ball
park, he's all business. He really, really bears down. He hits
three home runs, he wants to hit one the fourth time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox signed Belle to a five-year, $55 million contract
two years ago, making him the highest-paid baseball player ever.
But the contract also included a clause that said he could become a
free agent if he no longer was one of the three highest-paid
players. His new contract has no such clause.

 New BofA Debits Female Executives   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica was once hailed for its promotion of female executives,
but since its takeover by North Carolina-based NationsBank, almost
an entire generation of top women leaders has been swept away.
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since NationsBank took over BankAmerica and
adopted its name, all of the old BofA's top 10 women executives
have either resigned or been demoted, current and former BofA
employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 10 resigned after their jobs were give to NationsBank
executives. Several of them were offered lower-ranking positions
with less authority.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kathleen Burke, who as vice chairman for human
resources was the old BofA's highest ranking woman, resigned after
her job was given to NationsBank personnel chief Chuck Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   The other four top-ranking women now have jobs with less
authority and report to lower-ranking executives than they
previously did _ a move generally considered a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they had any intention of having me in a
position of influence,'' said one senior BofA woman who recently
left the bank. ``They harbor a feeling about women that they should
have bumble bees on their shoulders and be playing tennis at the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half a dozen current and former BofA women spoke to
The Chronicle on condition that they not be identified. Several
said their severance packages prohibited them from commenting
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former BofA employees said what happened to the
women was a result of NationsBank's tradition of putting its own
people in charge after a merger, combined with insensitivity to the
gains female executives had made at the San Francisco bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several BofA women said they were personally insulted when
NationsBank Chairman and Chief Executive Hugh McColl distributed a
videotape to employees before the merger was completed in which he
boasted of having ``the best men in banking.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of so many senior women has become a source of
anguish both within the bank and throughout the larger community of
Bay Area women executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating that whole group just sends a tremendously
negative message,'' said Beth Parker, director of program
litigation at Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco
public-interest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-ranking BofA female executives who resigned after the
acquisition was announced include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Group Executive Vice President Christine Garvey, head of
commercial real estate lending, who was replaced by a NationsBank's
Bill Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Group Executive Vice President Barbara Rambo, whose position
as head of lending to midsize companies was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathryn Munro, head of BofA's Southwest region, who was
replaced by NationsBank's Tim Arnoult.
</P>
<P>
   Women executives who stayed on in lesser jobs include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Desoer, who headed California retail banking and
reported to a vice chairman. She now runs Northern California
banking and reports to Eugene Taylor of NationsBank, the new
western regional president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Wikstrom, previously in charge of BofA's telephone
banking centers, now a project manager for direct banking and
specialty products.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern of resignations and demotions holds among the
next tier of female managers, although some BofA women at those
levels have kept their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the new BankAmerica rejected accusations of bias
and said senior women who left did so for personal reasons, not
because of pressure from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the women made a decision based on a combination of
personal and professional factors,''said Lorraine Stimmel,
executive vice president responsible for diversity programs at the
combined bank and herself a manager at the old BofA. ``Many of the
female executives were offered what I would consider important
positions in the new company.''
</P>
<P>
   Stimmel said the women with reduced authority had not been
demoted, because they hold important positions in a larger and more
powerful bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at these women and say they didn't come out
ahead, that is absolutely not the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stimmel said NationsBank has a good record of promoting females
and pointed out that women from the North Carolina bank hold such
top jobs as head of credit cards and president of Florida banking
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of women at BofA had a long history.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years ago, BofA signed an agreement to promote
female officers, settling complaints nine female employees had
brought to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, BofA Chairman and Chief Executive Richard
Rosenberg personally backed the advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, 11 of the bank's top 45 executives were female.
</P>
<P>
   ``BofA has been a pioneer,'' said Anne Golden, president of the
Financial Women's Association, which represents about 250 female
financial services executives in San Francisco. One former female
BofA executive, who sent The Chronicle a five-page memorandum on
the current status of women at BofA, wrote: ``In essence, the
entire generation of female executives created during (the past 25
years) has been wiped out.``
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the new bank said such comments do not express
the views of most women at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few women speaking anonymously don't represent the many
women managers and executives who have very senior roles,''
spokeswoman Melba Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Some BofA employees point out that many male BofA executives
also lost out to NationsBank executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, BofA women note that female executives have been hit
disproportionately hard.
</P>
<P>
   Two former BofA male executives sit on the bank's six-member
policy committee. And, BofA men have kept top jobs in global and
investment banking, where NationsBank historically was weak.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, generous severance packages, paying as much as
three years of salary, gave both male and female executives
incentive to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, several BofA employees said they came away from
meetings with NationsBank managers impressed by racial and gender
diversity at the North Carolina bank.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, BofA and NationsBank operated in vastly different
milieus for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a world of difference in the way women had to
operate in their culture _ it was much more old-school,'' said one
former BofA female manager. ``The NationsBank women were imbued
with quite a bit of that old-fashioned Southern charm.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of negotiating, Rhone-Poulenc SA of France and
Hoechst AG of Germany said Tuesday that they will take the first
step toward a merger by combining their pharmaceutical and
agricultural units into a new company.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst propel themselves
to the top of two industries. Their new company, Aventis, which
will be equally owned by Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, will be the
world's second leading pharmaceutical maker behind Merck &AMP; Co. and
the globe's top seller of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Few drug companies can match Aventis in size. The company, which
will be based in Strasbourg, France, should have annual sales of
$20 billion _ well ahead of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson _ employ 95,000 people and boast an annual operating profit
of $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is all about accelerating the top line,'' said Peter
McDougall, a pharmaceutical analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson
in London. ``Everyone has pointed out that Hoechst and
Rhone-Poulenc were never very successful in the past. Well, they
didn't have critical mass to compete. They do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst's shares closed Tuesday in Frankfurt at 68.1 marks, down
5.5 percent. Rhone-Poulenc's stock closed in Paris at 263.4 francs,
off 7 percent. In U.S. trading, Hoechst's American depositary
receipts closed Tuesday at $41, off 2.4 percent, while
Rhone-Poulenc's ADRs drooped 5.1 percent to $47.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoechst-Rhone-Poulenc courtship, one of the longest in
recent memory, has yet to be completed. The companies said they
will merge the remainder of their operations within the next two to
three years, after each company has had time to divest chemical and
other side businesses. The Aventis transaction is expected to close
by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had wrestled for weeks on how to construct a
merger of equals that would appease shareholders and pass the
scrutiny of European regulators. The French government had frowned
heavily on Rhone-Poulenc's assets falling under German control,
while Hoechst executives feared their shareholders would balk at
any deal that didn't give them a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that executives from both companies
believe they have struck a working middle ground. Hoechst now has
three years to sell off its assets, bringing it closer to
Rhone-Poulenc's size. By basing the company in France, executives
hope to appease any concerns the French government could raise.
France also offered a better tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Aventis appears to be a boon for the French. Analysts
pointed out that while Rhone-Poulenc should contribute only 45
percent of Aventis' total sales, it has a 50 percent stake in the
company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Rhone-Poulenc's assets have not been valued properly,''
said Viren Mehta, a partner with Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment research firm in New York. ``But
regardless for Rhone-Poulenc, it is a much better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Management responsibilities appear to be divied equally. Jurgen
Dormann, Hoechst's chief executive, will serve as the chairman of
Aventis, while Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's CEO, will be vice
chairman. Richard Markham, Hoechst's top pharmaceutical executive,
will head the drug business. Alain Godard, the head of
Rhone-Poulenc's crop-protection operation, will steer the
agrochemicals division.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc executives boasted that Aventis could
create $1.2 billion in savings during the next three years, with 60
percent of the total coming from the company's pharmaceutical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some of the savings could come from laying off 10
percent of the company's 95,000 employees, but that would be
difficult. Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst are already divesting several
businesses, and any further job reductions could anger the French
and German governments.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern among analysts is Aventis' weak presence
in the United States. Even though the company will be the world's
second largest drug seller, it will rank 12th in the United States,
far below companies with half its sales. As if expecting this
criticism, Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc executives noted that Aventis
would employ 3,400 sales representatives in the United States with
more soon to be hired. But that hardly appeased the company's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer has 5,500 salespeople in the United States,'' said
Mehta. ``That's a lot more than Aventis. But even if Aventis had
5,500 salespeople they would still have a tough time. They would
still be selling old products. This is about quality, not
quanity.''

 Tech firms help e-businesses get started  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When the Starr Report was released in September, Palo Alto resident
Ron Jones got the bright idea of building a Web site to sell
marshmallows printed with images of political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hired an artist to draw caricatures of Bill Clinton,
Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. He figured out how to stamp the
drawings on marshmallows with food coloring. And he found a Web
hosting company, City Online Communications of Oakland, to help him
get his site up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' e-business, Mellow Out Co.  &LR; (www.politicalroasters.com),
 &LR; began selling marshmallows for $1 a pop on October 1. The company
already has recovered its startup costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted with the site and want to add more products to
it,'' said Jones. ``Some people have been asking for the whole
Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is among thousands of entrepreneurs who have turned to a
portal, an internet service provider or other Web hosting service
to handle the technological side of their e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who put up their own sites, but things like
handling credit card charges and configuring the server properly
can get pretty complex pretty quickly,'' said Jim Balderston, an
analyst with Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   New e-commerce startups can lose customers if their business
takes off and they lack the technological prowess to handle a lot
of orders, cautioned Bill Burnham, an analyst with Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially for small businesses, if you don't have extensive
information-technology experience, outsourcing makes a lot more
sense,'' Balderston said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of Web hosting companies, which range from
big national names such as Yahoo to little local ISPs like City
Online.
</P>
<P>
   These companies offer a range of services for a variety of fees.
Their most important task is to ``host'' client sites on their
World Wide Web servers so that small companies don't have to buy
and maintain these expensive and complicated machines themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts also provide encryption technology so credit card
information can be sent over the Web relatively safely.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them also assist new businesses in setting up merchant
accounts with banks, something all business must have to accept
credit card payments.
</P>
<P>
   Other services that are commonly offered include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Site Design.  &LR; Some hosting companies will provide graphic
design services for customers for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply provide page templates that clients can organize
and personalize with colors, images and text of their own choosing.
The templates are designed to be simple enough for even
techno-dummies to create a passable site.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants who create their own sites need to have either a
scanner at their disposal or another way to create and upload
digital images.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Domain name registration.  &LR; There is a $70 base registration
fee charged by Network Solutions, which has been in charge of
regulating regulates all  &LR; domain names. Some hosting companies will
register a name at no extra cost while others charge a service fee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Search engine registration.  &LR; Most visitors to small,
specialized e-commerce sites find the site by keying a search term,
such as ``marshmallow'' or ``Linda Tripp,'' into a search engine.
The search engine then lists sites that include that word.
</P>
<P>
   Some hosting services will register search words for each site
they host with anywhere from a handful to hundreds of search
engines and directories. Others leave registering up to their
clients, who may or may not choose to do it. (Many search terms are
picked up by search engines without registering.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Traffic analysis reports.  &LR; Most hosts analyze information
from their servers to track visitors to their client sites. The
sites then can use these reports to find out, for example, which
search engines most visitors used to find them and even which
search terms generated the most visits.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bull, who runs a site that sells educational games for
children with learning disabilities, cautions that designing a site
can be more complicated than would-be merchants might expect, even
when using a very user-friendly hosting service.
</P>
<P>
   Bull's site  &LR; (www.smartstuffgoodideas.com),  &LR; which he designed
himself, is hosted by Yahoo, which says even design novices can set
up a store in under an hour using its templates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put up one product on one page and you have all of your
(design elements) prepared in advance, it would take an hour,''
said Bull, a film and video director who runs Smart Stuff &AMP; Good
Ideas out of his Menlo Park garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I spend hours tweaking it to make it nice,'' Bull
added.

CONFISCATED COMPUTER YIELDS GLIMPSE OF BIN LADEN ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden
sat down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. He was
worried, he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the
``East Africa network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of
masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the author complained, had declared war
against the United States, yet he had learned of that only from the
news media. The writer, who federal authorities believe was Haroun
Fazil, who was to become one of the central suspects in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi a year later, noted with alarm
British press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said he was worried that
``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, seemed to have
``fallen into the enemy's hands.'' He said the Americans were
breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that he
had to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cell is at 100 percent danger,'' the operative warned.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital evidence in a
cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer in a house
where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed in U.S.
District Court in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The papers said the computer was seized in August 1997 in a raid
by Kenyan authorities that was attended by an FBI agent. The
documents did not make clear whether the FBI had translated and
read the document before or after the bombings of the U.S.
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7 of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is potentially important because there have been
mounting questions since the bombings about whether the United
States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist
attack on American targets in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York
City refused to say Tuesday night at what point FBI agents learned
of the computer file, nor would they make any other comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil eluded American investigators after the bombing as he
traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands and then to
the Middle East. He remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatch provides a remarkable insight into the workings of
a terrorist network in the twilight of the 20th century. The author
talks of how he and his fellow operatives follow events on CNN and
use the Internet to communicate. He refers to himself as the media
information officer of the East Africa cell and complains that he
is not being kept in the loop on big decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seems
to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin
Laden's door by federal authorities _ the attacks on American
soldiers in Somalia in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The writer of the document warned that the followers of bin
Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had ``become America's
primary target.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said his comrades in East Africa ``should know that there is
an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence activity in Nairobi aiming
to identify the names and residences of the members who are
associated with the sheik since America knows well that the youth
who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's cell are the
ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that since Kenya was the main gateway for those
members, there must be a center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding:
``We are really in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to
prepare and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based
associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to
bin Laden about the ``security'' situation of the cell.
</P>
<P>
   Fawwaz, who served as an informal press spokesman for bin Laden
in London, was arrested by British authorities in September after
the embassy bombings. He has denied any connection to terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A translation of the report was part of a package of documents
American prosecutors have sent to Britain to support the
extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. It is not clear from
the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which were initially filed in secret, include a
federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with bin Laden
to kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him with
soliciting others to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The report made clear that the organization was being run on a
shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother has fallen ill, and
that he would like to return to his homeland for a visit. ``What do
you think? Keep in mind we only have $500.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly expressed his fears of American intelligence,
which he believed was in the midst of a worldwide search for bin
Laden and his associates. ``There is a war and the situation is
dangerous,'' he said. He wrote that American forces kidnapped
anyone who threatened the national security or American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The author noted with alarm a recent CIA operation in which a
man accused of shooting agency employees had been lured across the
border in Pakistan and returned to the United States for trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal authorities, Fazil went on to play a
pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors
assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and
surveyed the embassy's security precautions. On Aug. 7, they
charge, Fazil drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way
for a vehicle carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the report said that he stood ready to ``fight the
forces of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based
operatives of all its global plans, but they needed enough warning
to go ``underground for a while'' if authorities intensified the
pressure in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about
the operations plans,'' he wrote, `` since we are just
implementers.''

GATES CASE MADE IN E-MAIL TO STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an e-mail to his executive staff on Tuesday,
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., said that the government's
antitrust case was seriously undercut by America Online's planned
$4.2 billion purchase of Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The government, Gates wrote, ``must be VERY dismayed at this
merger,'' because it proved that Microsoft's move to give its
browser away was not predatory pricing but a recognition of its
``competitive price, which is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is Netscape worth $4 billion,'' Gates wrote, ``despite
making its browser available for free,'' as it later did to match
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Browsers are like network TV,'' Gates said. ``The traffic
alone makes it a great business.'' It is not predatory to price a
product profitably, he said, adding, ``It's called the marketplace
at work, and it helps consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, accused
Gates of revisionist history. Internal documents from late 1995,
when the company decided to give away the browser, he said
indicated ``it was Microsoft's explicit purpose to cut off
Netscape's air supply.''

   WASHINGTON _ Even President Clinton concedes that he did not
tell the truth about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But did
he commit perjury under the definition of the law?
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House of Representatives over whether to impeach
Clinton could turn on how this question is answered. The consensus
of Republicans in Congress is that he clearly perjured himself, and
many say it is the charge on which they are most confident they can
muster a majority for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the evidence is most compelling,'' said Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla., a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
``That will be the major focus'' of articles of impeachment, Canady
added.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats say that even if the president did lie under oath
about a sexual relationship, it is insufficient grounds for
impeachment. At Tuesday's committee hearing, some offered a new
line of defense, saying Republicans had failed to prove that
Clinton had perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had called the hearing to emphasize that perjury is
an important crime. The federal perjury laws require prosecutors to
prove that offenders ``knowingly'' lied under oath and that the
lies were ``material'' to the cases in which the false testimony
was given.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Clinton and some Democrats at Tuesday's hearing
maintain that he did not commit perjury because his sworn
statements, however misleading, were literally true on all
important matters. They said that either he believed his denials to
be true, testified that he could not recall something or had
recollections at odds with other witnesses. At worst, they said,
this would be misleading, but not deliberately false.
</P>
<P>
   In his public address on Aug. 17, Clinton conceded that he did
have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was inappropriate and
wrong and that his statements about it had been misleading. But the
president also said his answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones
case last January, when he denied having sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky, were ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has held that intentionally misleading
statements do not amount to perjury. In a 1973 case (Bronston vs.
United States), the court ruled that perjury had not occurred when
this testimony was given under oath by a witness who maintained a
Swiss bank account for five years but closed it:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Switzerland?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever?
</P>
<P>
   A. The company had an account there for about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans working on drafting articles of impeachment say say
they are generally following the lines established by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In his report to Congress, Starr
cited these five instances when, he maintained, the president had
lied under oath:
</P>
<P>
   1. In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied he had
engaged in a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   2. He made similar denials to the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   3. In the civil deposition, he said he could not remember being
alone in the White House with Ms. Lewinsky or giving her presents.
</P>
<P>
   4. In the deposition, he said he had not had a detailed
conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about her testimony in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   5. In the deposition, he said he did not remember whether his
friend Vernon Jordan Jr. had talked with Ms. Lewinsky about the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics agree that the strongest cases can be made in
the first three. The facts in these cases are not in dispute, only
the interpretation. Here are the details:
</P>
<P>
   1. When the president gave his deposition in the Jones case on
Jan. 17, this definition of ``sexual relations'' was agreed on: ``A
person engages in `sexual relations' when the person knowingly
engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ... `Contact'
means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked: ``Have you ever had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined?''
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told the federal grand jury about 10 encounters she
had with Clinton that involved intimate contact but not
intercourse. In his grand jury testimony, he took the view that his
statement in the deposition had been accurate because sexual
relations occurred only with sexual intercourse. As for oral sex,
he said, ``If the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed
on him, then the contact is ... not with anything on that list but
with the lips of another person.''
</P>
<P>
   2. When Clinton went before the grand jury on Aug. 17,
prosecutors bore in on the question of whether he had touched Ms.
Lewinsky in the designated areas.
</P>
<P>
   This was one exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Q. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval
Office area you touched her breasts, would she be lying?
</P>
<P>
   A. That is not my recollection. My recollection is that I did
not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After some back-and-forth, the questioning continued, as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   Q. So touching in your view then and now _ the person being
deposed touching or kissing the breast of another person would fall
within the definition?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct, sir.
</P>
<P>
   And moments later, there was this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   A. You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not
have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Including touching her breast, kissing her breast, touching
her genitalia?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   3. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone with Clinton in the
Oval Office many times.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself told the grand jury that he ``was alone
with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in
early 1997.'' He also acknowledged to the grand jury that he and
Ms. Lewinsky had exchanged gifts, a fact corroborated by
considerable evidence. That contradicted his answers to questions
in his sworn deposition in the Jones case about being alone with
Ms. Lewinsky. In the deposition, Clinton claimed a lack of memory.
</P>
<P>
   This was one exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Q. At any time, were you and Monica Lewinsky together in the
Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall.
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to say that they might have been alone
incidentally when she brought papers to him to sign or dropped off
material.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they had been alone in the hallway where Ms.
Lewinsky said some of the sexual encounters occurred, Clinton
responded: ``I don't believe so, unless we were walking back to the
back dining room with the pizza. I just don't remember. I don't
believe we were alone in the hallway, no.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of gifts, he had this exchange with the Jones
lawyers:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall. Do you know what they were?
</P>
<P>
   Q. A hat pin?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember. But I certainly could have.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A book about Walt Whitman?
</P>
<P>
   A. I give people a lot of gifts, and when people are around, I
give a lot of things I have at the White House away. So I could
have given her a gift, but I don't remember a specific gift.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can read these questions and answers without
concluding that Clinton lied. But that does not mean, under law,
that he committed perjury.

TYSON PLEADS NO CONTEST IN TRAFFIC ALTERCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when Mike Tyson is about to get his ring career back on
track, his legal woes have put a cloud over his future. Tyson
pleaded no contest Tuesday to two misdemeanor assault charges from
an incident after a traffic accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   The plea was not an admission of guilt, but Tyson could face
jail time and a fine when he is sentenced early next year. Tyson,
who is on probation on a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana, could
also have his parole revoked if Indiana authorities consider the
no-contest plea a violation of his parole.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 31, is scheduled to fight Francois Botha in Las Vegas on
Jan. 16 in his first bout since regaining his license from the
Nevada State Athletic Commission on Oct. 19. Tyson's license was
revoked on July 9, 1997, after he was disqualified for biting the
ears of Evander Holyfield during a heavyweight championship bout 11
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing adviser, said Tyson is supposed to
go back to Montgomery County, Md., at the end of January or the
beginning of February to be sentenced on the misdemeanor charges.
That would be after his scheduled bout against Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is accused of kicking and punching two men, Abmielec
Saucedo and Richard Hardick, after the accident. His lawyer, Paul
Kemp, told Montgomery County Judge Steven Johnson on Tuesday that
Tyson struck Hardick with a glancing blow, Kemp said, and
inadvertently kicked Saucedo while being restrained. Tyson has
avoided a civil lawsuit by reaching a settlement with Saucedo and
Hardick.

   EXXON ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BUY MOBIL FOR $80 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, already the United States' largest oil company, agreed to
buy Mobil, the next-largest, for $80 billion in stock, to form the
world's biggest corporation, on a scale surpassing that of many
sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the merger is not likely to have any immediate effect on
prices at the pump, antitrust regulators will certainly scrutinize
it and probably force the sale of some gas stations and refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say that they now confront global competitors and
plunging energy prices, making their merger and the resulting
savings a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Total, the giant French oil company, said it would acquire the
Belgian petrochemical company Petrofina in a stock swap worth $13
billion.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEAN DRUG MAKERS TO MERGE
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiating, Rhone-Poulenc of France and Hoechst
of Germany said they would combine their pharmaceutical and
agricultural units into a new company, Aventis, as the first step
of a merger between the drug makers. Aventis will be the world's
second-leading pharmaceutical maker behind Merck &AMP; Co. and the
globe's top seller of agricultural products. Jurgen Dormann
Hoechst's chief executive, will serve as the chairman of Aventis,
while Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's chief, will serve as vice
chairman.

   MIXED SIGNALS ON ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing sector slowed for the sixth straight month in
November as industrial companies felt the effect of the global
financial crisis, but a separate report suggested the economy would
improve by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. EQUITY MARKETS RECOVER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks bounced back, led by a strong recovery in prices of
computer-related and Internet shares. The Nasdaq Composite index
rose 54.21 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2003.75. The Dow Jones
industrial average, down more than 100 points early in the session,
closed at 9133.54, up 16.99, or 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MARKET FOR FUNDS IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Sales of mutual funds through banks got off to what may prove to
be a deceptively quiet start in Japan. But the banks, which have
vast branch networks throughout Japan, represent a huge opportunity
to reach groups of customers so far untapped.
</P>
<P>
   IBM EXTENDS NETWORK BIDDING
</P>
<P>
   IBM has postponed the deadline for companies to submit final
bids for its global communications network until next Tuesday,
executives close to the bidding said. The auction, expected to
raise between $4 billion and $5 billion, was originally scheduled
to close this Tuesday night, but IBM pushed back the deadline to
allow bidders to become more comfortable with their final offers.

FRESH FACES, FAMILIAR NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (Eds: Please note subslug for GASSMAN-STEAM-FILM)  
 Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about the
trend towards dark comedies.  
 (af)  
 By TED LOOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Italian actor Alessandro Gassman, taking the lead role
in ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' was the riskiest _ and maybe the
smartest _ move of his career. Gassman plays a married Italian
designer who goes to Istanbul to take care of his aunt's estate.
While there, he discovers the enticing culture of the Turkish bath
_ and with it, the realization that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   His role in ``Steam,'' a thoughtful and elegiac film by Ferzan
Ozpetek, must have surprised some fans, since Gassman was best
known for a successful series of light comedies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But his 76-year-old father was not shocked; in fact, he
encouraged the venture. After all, the father is Vittorio Gassman,
a fixture on the Italian stage and screen for more than 50 years,
and an actor who is also pushing the boundaries of his craft; in
1994 he mounted a notoriously expensive stage version of ``Moby
Dick'' that toured Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is one of my strongest fans,'' said Gassman, 33, on
the telephone from his home in Rome. ``He's my counselor.'' The
fatherly advice obviously paid off. ``Steam,'' which opened in New
York on Nov. 25, set attendance records in Turkey (fueled by
controversy over its gay theme) and was a surprising success at the
box office in Italy. Now the actor finds himself in the running for
all kinds of roles.
</P>
<P>
   Gassman is only one of a new generation of European actors and
directors in their 20s and early 30s who are following their more
famous elders in a family business in which both success and
failure occur under a spotlight. Though these issues are familiar
to American scions of the Sheen, Bridges, Fonda and Douglas
families, in the smaller and more insular world of European cinema
the extremes are magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may be even easier to get started _ several European
actors said that they had got their first role, as children,
through family connections _ the work of their parents looms even
larger in the public mind. And that makes it harder for the sons
and daughters to become stars in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   The Gassmans have acted together three times (most recently they
finished filming a Mafia comedy set partly in New York), but the
younger Gassman says it's important to keep some creative distance
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is famous in the theater for playing Othello,'' he
said. ``If I was offered the role of Othello, I would ask to play
Iago.''
</P>
<P>
   Gassman added that the sons and daughters of Italian film stars
who have become successful did so ``not by copying their parents,
but for having their own personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who tried to clone their parents did not succeed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the European actors working today, none can claim more
illustrious lineage than Chiara Mastroianni. With Catherine Deneuve
and Marcello Mastroianni as parents, she might seem to have a
predestined career. But it is also daunting, since her parents
became icons when European film was at its apex of influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, no matter what, journalists will ask me about my parents
until the day I die,'' said Ms. Mastroianni, 26, on the telephone
from her apartment in Paris. ``Sometimes I wish I had worked in
America, because I feel it's more common there. In Europe, it's
very difficult for people to forget your parents when they are so
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the fact that some American sons of stars,
including Michael Douglas, had become better known than their
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   For directors, the stakes are not quite as high, since audiences
are less likely to choose a movie based on the director's name. But
the first-time feature film director Jake Scott, son of the British
director Ridley Scott and nephew of the director Tony Scott, said
that the challenges were different in Europe, where fans and people
in the industry truly revere the elders of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, they're more open-minded about it,'' said the
boyish-looking Scott, 33, surrounded by black videotape boxes in
his London office. ``Nepotism is an accepted part of the business.
Here you have to prove yourself a little more.'' But he also
acknowledged that the big-business nature of Hollywood film leaves
little room for failure, even for those with the right last name.
``I get the sense that in America, if you screw up, they'll drop
you like a ton of lead.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mastroianni, entry into the business was made easier by
acting with her mother in her first film, ``Ma Saison Preferee''
(1993). Ms. Mastroianni was brought up by Ms. Deneuve, since her
parents split when she was 3 years old, but she remained very close
to her father, who died in 1996, and acted with him (in a small
role) in Robert Altman's 1994 ``Ready to Wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of disappointing him,'' she said of the scenes
with her father. ``To tell your parents you want to do the same
things can be tough, but when you happen to work with them it's
even worse. But it went very well. On the set, we were just actors
working together.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who has a 2-year-old son with her boyfriend, said
she would be wary if her own child announced his intention to
become an actor. That echoes her parents' concerns. ``The first
thing they advised me was not to be an actress,'' said Ms.
Mastroianni. ``They were completely against it, but I didn't
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were aware that they had unusually charmed careers.
``When my mother started, she hit the top right away,'' said Ms.
Mastroianni. ``She arrived like a meteor.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference between the generations stems from the
diminished position of European film on the worldwide market. Ms.
Deneuve was able to become an international star as well as a
French one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, French and Italian movies are distributed on a much smaller
scale in the United States than they were 30 years ago, and
international stars are even more likely to come through the
Hollywood studio system.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Mastroianni said she didn't usually consult with her
mother about whether to take a role, she did talk with her when
considering Gregg Araki's ``Nowhere,'' a notably bleak and violent
film. Usually the actresses, who are both based in Paris, don't
discuss the details of their craft. Ms. Mastroianni said that when
they chatted at the end of separate on-set workdays, ``we're more
likely to talk about other people's movies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Mastroianni and Charlotte Gainsbourg, another offspring
of two well-known parents in French film, have chosen edgier, more
intellectual projects that would be called independent in this
country. So far, neither has made a serious attempt to cross over
to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe being in the second generation teaches you to be even
more demanding of the quality of your films,'' said Ms.
Mastroianni, whose next film, ``The Letter,'' is by the veteran
Portuguese director Manoel De Oliveira.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, European film budgets are small by American standards,
and the gulf between commercial films and art films is much
smaller. ``In France, you can't really talk of independent and
non-independent films,'' said Ms. Gainsbourg, 27, speaking on the
telephone from a location shoot in France.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gainsbourg, who has earned a reputation as one of Europe's
best young actresses, is the daughter of the French actor, director
and singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg and the English-born actress
and singer Jane Birkin. In their heyday of the 1960s and 70s, her
parents were staples of French gossip columns for their party going
and notorious for their heavy-breathing song ``Je t'Aime.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many film scions, she got her first role the old-fashioned
way. ``The luck I had was that my mother knew the casting director,
and he happened to be looking for an actress my age,'' she said.
(In fact, the film ``Paroles et Musiques'' also starred Ms.
Deneuve, illustrating the tight-knit nature of French film.)
</P>
<P>
   Though she is best known in this country for starring in Franco
Zeffirelli's sedate ``Jane Eyre'' (1996), many of Ms. Gainsbourg's
roles have been provocative. At age 13, she starred in a drama
about father-daughter incest, ``Charlotte Forever,'' starring and
directed by the legendarily scandalous Gainsbourg, who died in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was a true cause celebre _ one scene showed the
Gainsbourgs in bed together _ but Ms. Gainsbourg weathered the
furor stoically. ``I understood what we did and what people said
about it,'' she said. ``I wasn't shocked, because I knew what my
father had in his head creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of that experience, the actress now takes pains
to guard her privacy. ``My parents loved being in the magazines and
having their private lives exposed,'' said Ms. Gainsbourg. ``I
understand it, but I am the complete opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jake Scott, nepotism is a more mundane, day-to-day affair.
He is a partner in Ridley Scott Associates, the advertising company
founded by his father before he became known as the director of
``Alien,'' ``Blade Runner'' and ``Thelma and Louise.'' (Though
British, the elder Scott has long been entrenched as a Hollywood
director.) The younger Scott has directed many commercials and
music videos, and won an MTV Award for R.E.M.'s ``Everybody Hurts''
video in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been an obstacle before. It's only opened doors,''
said Scott of his family name. His first feature film, ``Plunkett
and MaCleane,'' is due out next year. ``But lately I've become
aware that I'm on trial _ by myself. I've watched my father and my
uncle make some very fine films. In making this one, I realized I
wanted it to be as good as theirs. It's not. It couldn't be, as my
first film.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he had had no intention of entering the family
business at first. ``I thought I was going to become a painter,''
he said. ``Growing up in that kind of family, it was pretty well
all-consuming, and I was less inclined to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his first film, Scott made sure it was produced without help
from his father. But some progeny actually want to become more
closely identified with their famous parents as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   Asia Argento, 23, the daughter of the Italian horror director
Dario Argento, has already acted in 20 films. Though next year she
will be seen on screen in Abel Ferrara's ``New Rose Hotel'' and
Michael Radford's ``B. Monkey,'' her next project is working on her
feature directorial debut, a film produced by her father.
</P>
<P>
   After having done seven films, she first appeared in front of
her father's camera at age 16. She said she had always been
inspired by the example of her father, who is a cult figure in his
home country for films like 1977's ``Suspiria.'' (Her mother, Daria
Nicolodi, is primarily a stage actress, and not as well known.)
</P>
<P>
   The film that Ms. Argento is writing and directing, ``The
Faceless,'' is not exactly a horror movie, but it displays her
father's penchant for Gothic extremes. It tells the story of two
soldiers who lose their faces in a war and the woman who believes
one of them may be her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film is completed, Ms. Argento said that she wanted to
continue to work mostly in Italian film, and especially with her
father. For some in the second generation of European film,
exploring their chosen art form also affords a rare opportunity to
create a family album on celluloid. ``I've had this great chance in
life doing something eternal with someone of my own blood,'' she

DIMAGGIO IS SAID TO IMPROVE, BUT DOCTORS REMAIN CAUTIOUS

   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ The lead doctor in the medical team treating
Joe DiMaggio said Tuesday that his condition had improved following
a serious setback last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Earl Barron said in an interview that DiMaggio's temperature
had dropped and that his white blood cell count had improved.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardiologist noted: ``You have to put this in
perspective. You've got an 84-year-old man who had a major surgical
operation, which was for a cancer, which of course is also a
difficult situation. His lungs have responded with some
inflammation and some infection. It's a difficult situation. I
think he can survive. He's a tough guy; there's no question about
it. I would say the prognosis is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   After a short pause, Barron added: ``There are so many variables
and there are so many things that can happen. It's almost
impossible to give a blanket statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron said he was encouraged by the outcome of lung cancer
surgery Oct. 14. ``You can never be 100 percent sure, but we feel
strongly that all of the tumor was removed,'' he said. ``Ordinarily
in this circumstance, had he recovered quickly from the surgery, he
probably would have undergone radiation treatment as an adjunct to
the surgery to try to prevent any reoccurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio remains on a respirator, Barron said, and can be taken
off only ``for a short period.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the Yankee Hall of Famer's ability to speak
because of the weakening of his lungs, a speech therapist hopes to
plug DiMaggio's tracheotomy soon for 20 minutes a day so he can
begin talking again.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a dangerous drop in DiMaggio's blood pressure when he
takes certain medication, doctors treating him are left mainly to
react to new lung infections rather than preventing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't treat before because what happens is, if you treat
before, you select out organisms that are not sensitive to your
antibiotic, and it makes the situation worse,'' Barron said. ``You
just basically have to react to things that happen rather than
anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's spokesman and longtime friend,
said: ``They're more concerned with his pressure than anything else
right now. Because if his pressure drops, he could be in trouble. I
think they're trying to find a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital here on Oct.
12, DiMaggio has twice been close to death, according to both
Barron and Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost lost him on Saturday,'' Engelberg said. DiMaggio
also was in danger on Nov. 16, after his blood pressure plunged 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get on top of one infection and he seems to be OK, and you
turn around and get another one,'' Barron said. ``These are not
preventable things. We make every sterile precaution we can, and
you still have problems. You've got irritated lung tissue, which is
a very good culture medium, and bacteria love it.''

SUN SCIENTIST SAYS MICROSOFT GARBLED HIS LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At an industry meeting in February 1997, a
Microsoft Corp. official vowed that his company ``wouldn't be
cowboys'' by altering the Java programming language on its own, an
executive of Sun Microsystems Inc. said in testimony released
Tuesday. Seven months later, he testified, Microsoft did precisely
that in an effort to eliminate ``the threat posed by Java
technology to Microsoft's operating system monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, James Gosling, vice president of Sun
and the chief scientist of its Java software division, opened a new
line of attack by the Justice Department in its antitrust lawsuit
against Microsoft: the company's move to tailor its version of Java
for its Windows operating system, making it incompatible with the
standard Java language developed by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's changes to Java are also the subject of a private
contract suit in California in which a federal judge two weeks ago
ordered Microsoft to make its version of Java compatible with Sun's
version within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust trial, the government alleges that Microsoft's
Java strategy is part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices
that the company took to stifle competition and maintain its
dominance in the market for personal computer software. The
government asserts that the combination of Java, an Internet
programming language, and the browser software used to navigate the
World Wide Web, which was pioneered by the Netscape Communications
Corp., posed a potent threat to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of that threat was the promise that programs written
in Java could run on any operating system. Traditional software
runs on only one operating system. Because Windows is the operating
system on more than 90 percent of personal computers, software
developers have long written mainly for Windows. That tends to lock
in Microsoft's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   In his 35 pages of testimony, Gosling said he created the Java
programming language in 1991 to free programmers from the
limitation of ``platform-specific software.'' But in September
1997, Gosling said, Microsoft introduced an upgraded version of its
browser software, Internet Explorer 4.0, that was linked to Windows
``in ways to undermine the cross-platform promise of Java
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert programmer whose resume includes a dozen patents,
Gosling testified that what Microsoft had done to the Java
programming language was ``analogous to adding to the English
language words and phrases that cannot be understood by anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that the government and Sun are misrepresenting
both its actions and its motives. Microsoft says it introduced
changes to overcome the shortcomings of standard Java and make it
run better on Windows. Sun's motto for Java, ``Write Once, Run
Anywhere,'' has proved a wonderful marketing slogan but not a
real-world description of the language's capabilities, Microsoft
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many programs written in Java today do have to call
directly on a specific operating system to work properly. Sun has
one way of enabling these ``native'' calls on the operating system,
while Microsoft has another. That difference is the crux of Sun's
California case and of the government's claim that Microsoft has
tried to ``pollute'' Java.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Tuesday, Microsoft's pricing practices also
became a focus of debate as Frederick Warren-Boulton, an economist,
used an internal Microsoft document to analyze the prices the
company has charged personal computer makers from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two key indicators that a company has monopoly power are its
ability to raise prices and its ability to exclude competition. The
Microsoft document showed that the average price computer makers
paid for its operating system rose from $19.03 per PC in 1990 to
$49.40 in 1996. Over the same period, the operating system's share
of the total cost of a personal computer rose fivefold, from
five-tenths of a percent to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton pointed to the pricing trend as proof that
``Microsoft's monopoly power is increasing, or the extent to which
it is exerting that power is increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray,
pointed out that the operating system had improved over the years,
gaining many new functions and capabilities. In 1990, many computer
makers loaded new computers with Microsoft's basic DOS operating
system, while by 1996 the industry had shifted to Windows 95, which
is both more expensive and richer in features.

SPORTS COLUMN: POLAR POINTS FOR RIPKEN AND BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may have happened after Albert Belle turned down the
thermostat in the Cleveland Indians' clubhouse _ he liked the
climate rather cool. When someone perhaps suffering frostbite
turned it up again, why, Albert naturally took bat in hand and
smashed the thermostat into little pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was after some other tantrum or incivility
perpetrated by Belle, but it miffed one of his teammates, Eddie
Murray, who grabbed Belle by the front of his jersey and shoved him
up against a wall a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of your moody inanities,'' said Murray _ or
unprintable words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Other players froze. Murray was not the most effervescent of
personalities himself, but he was an elder statesman on the club,
and someone the other players respected.
</P>
<P>
   Belle backed off. Another Indian teammate, Carlos Baerga, had
said, ``No one can figure Albert out.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, for Albert continued to be a prize catch for a
baseball team, and in recent weeks has been romanced by several
clubs, the New York Yankees included. Tuesday, he sealed a deal
with the Baltimore Orioles for $65 million over five years, after
having played left field the last two seasons for the Chicago White
Sox for only $11 million a year, $2 million a season less than
he'll be earning in the Baltimore outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The man instrumental in this was none other than Eddie Murray,
now a coach with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was on the phone a lot with Albert,'' said John Maroon,
a spokesman for the team, ``trying to convince him to play here.''
He did what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert has grown up a lot in the last few years,'' Murray
said. ``He's someone who comes to play every day. Everyone knows
what kind of offensive threat he is, but he's also a much better
defensive player than people give him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people wonder why anyone would want to pay someone like
Albert Belle this kind of money, especially with his off-the-field
record, which includes antisocial behavior like the thermostat
incident, imbroglios with the news media, confrontations with
various citizens that have brought the police to his doorstep, and
a gambling situation that has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a seeming problem with the Orioles in which Belle
joins Cal Ripken, whose national popularity as homespun
all-American would seem to be oil and ointment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the Orioles need hitting and Belle is one of
baseball's best hitters _ over the last eight seasons, he is the
major league leader in homers, doubles, runs batted in, extra-base
hits and total bases, batting .328 last season with 49 homers and
152 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Ripken, at 38, is losing much of the steam at bat
and ability to cover ground in the field that had made him one of
the game's best players. The fact is, there is more than meets the
eye in regard to both Belle and Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   For all Belle's headlined irascibility, he is a dedicated
ballplayer. He lusts to win. When the White Sox weren't drawing,
despite Belle's hitting, Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox,
spoke with Belle, asking him to be more cooperative, to tip his cap
to the fans, to be more amenable to the press. ``I'm not
comfortable smiling when we're not winning,'' he said. ``It's not
me. I play better when I'm angry.'' And he stayed true to his surly
self.
</P>
<P>
   When a former Indians teammate went to shake Belle's hand during
a batting practice, Belle turned his back. ``They're like any other
team,'' he said, ``they're the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is a loner of sorts on his team, too. He stays at a
different hotel on the road, holds himself somewhat aloof and
distant in the clubhouse. Teammates have expressed resentment at
this and felt it hurts the chemistry of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wren, the new general manager of the Orioles, said: ``What
we need on the team is more passion, more fire. We hope Belle can
instill that.'' An old saying just may apply: be careful what you
wish for, you might get it.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's consecutive game record of 2,632 _ which ended when he
took himself out of the lineup at the end of last season _ made him
a fan favorite, the blue-collar worker supreme. But he has been
slipping, moving grumblingly from short to third, and in 1999 he
may even be asked to play first base.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, 32, possesses a similarly diligent work ethic as Ripken.
In the last seven years, Belle has missed only a handful of games.
And he has the longest current consecutive-game playing streak, at
334 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's current streak, if you're counting, is seven. &QL;

   The landscape is empty, the horizon a flat, unbroken line that
meets itself behind you. There is no place bleaker or more
horizontal than this patch of arid earth at the edge of time. The
only sign of nature is a small, spindly, leafless tree.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of uncharacteristic despondency, Ollie and Stan, two
fastidious tramps in ancient derby hats, decide they can't go on.
Better to end it all. They will hang themselves from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Ollie, the portly one and the more commanding of the two, tells
Stan to go first. Stan, who's as thin as a rail, is usually
passive, but this is one of those times when he can be stubborn.
``Why me?'' he asks. Ollie is patient. He points out: ``You're
lighter than I am.'' ``Just so!'' says Stan. Ollie reacts as if
dealing with a small boy: ``I don't understand.'' But his fluty
tenor has taken on a menacing bite.
</P>
<P>
   Stan feels cornered, as he often does with Ollie. He has trouble
expressing himself. He mumbles something about the branch. When
Ollie persists in being obtuse, Stan angrily tells him to use his
intelligence, to use his head. Ollie, his eyebrows arched, his tiny
mustache twitching, says with what he thinks is majestic sarcasm:
``You're my only hope.'' They seem to be at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   This finally prompts Stan to put his thoughts in order. He
explains that, being skinny, he probably won't break the branch
when he falls. If he goes first, he will be dead as planned. But
then Ollie, who clearly weighs a ton, is likely to tear the branch
from the tree, if not uproot the tree itself, and thus survive the
suicide attempt. He will be left alone, forever denied the company
of his oldest friend. Stan seems about to cry, not only because he
fears his own death, but also because he can so intimately
understand Ollie's loss of him.
</P>
<P>
   In such moments, low comedy approaches bliss.
</P>
<P>
   That is a scene from Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot'' as
it might look and sound if Vladimir, called Didi, and Estragon,
called Gogo, were played by the great early film comedians, Oliver
Hardy and Stan Laurel. The immediate inspiration for this daydream:
the ``Waiting for Godot'' now being performed at the Classic Stage
Company with a cast of good actors who have established their
respectability elsewhere. The new production is far from
satisfactory, being earnest, actorly and filled with empty moments
that invite the mind to wander. Also to wonder: What if?
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Conversations With and About Beckett,'' my
colleague Mel Gussow reports that, in 1982, when he asked Beckett
if he would like to have seen Laurel and Hardy in ``Godot,'' the
playwright ``seemed tantalized by the idea.'' A moment later he
said simply, ``It's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's fondness for the comedy of music hall and early movies
has often been noted. What is of interest here is the particular
reference to Laurel and Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Since reading Beckett's response I've been haunted: every time I
go back to ``Godot'' I can hear Stan and Ollie as they say the
lines. I can also see them as they attempt to come to terms with
the playwright's universe in ways that are simultaneously
Beckettian and pure Laurel and Hardy. Is this a coincidence, or was
Beckett guided by the kind of subliminal impulses that may be
mysterious as a writer writes, and only later are recognized?
</P>
<P>
   However Beckett came to create Didi and Gogo, they remain for me
much funnier and more moving on the page, where Stan and Ollie are
the stars, than they ever have been on the stage. Actors, possibly
intimidated by Beckett's description of the play as a tragicomedy,
too often act the roles with grave signification, or they attempt
to jazz them up with comedic bits for which they have no gift, or
that are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A sad fact: I've never seen a production of ``Godot'' that
realized more than isolated portions of the Beckett text. But then
I missed what was reported to be the definitive ``Godot'': the
German-language production directed by Beckett for the Schiller
Theater of West Berlin, which was seen at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in 1977. I also missed the Mike Nichols ``Godot'' at Lincoln
Center in 1988, when Robin Williams' ad-libs and interpolations
dismayed purists but helped to insure that the run remained a
sellout.
</P>
<P>
   The best ``Godot'' I've ever seen was the Gate Theater
production from Dublin, one of the prime attractions of the 1996
Lincoln Center Festival, but even it was imperfect. The production
not only reminded us of Beckett's lifelong Irishness; it also
reduced ``Godot,'' if only for the play's duration, to something
like a parable concerned with the Irish-English question.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett is probably the only modern playwright whose works do
not need, or benefit from, being located in a time and place
identifiable through topical allusions and visual aids. The
dazzling shreds of ideas that pass through the minds of the
characters, as well as the awesome intensity with which the
characters attend their crises, are specific enough. Sometimes, as
in ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' that specificity takes in a somewhat
larger community. Poor old Krapp will always be Irish-born and bred
no matter who the actor is or what language he speaks in.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the wasteland in which ``Godot'' is set, the play
doesn't take place in some never-never land. The location is the
tiny, utterly specific alternate universe of characters so
harrowed, desperate and self-absorbed that this is what they
comprehend. It's all there is.
</P>
<P>
   The Western world is filled with mannerly Didis and Gogos,
moving around in severely circumscribed landscapes, waiting for
something to take them out of themselves. The next block is full of
unknown terrors. Chance encounters are to be avoided. Their
carefree moments are few.
</P>
<P>
   The trading of insults can give one a sense of self. Says Didi
after he and Gogo have gone at each other as a form of therapeutic
exercise: ``How time flies when one has fun!'' When Pozzo, the
tyrant, and Lucky, Pozzo's slave, finally leave the stage, having
scared the wits out of Didi and Gogo, Didi observes in all his
wisdom, ``That passed the time.'' Responds Gogo (and you can hear
Stan's voice, unintentionally impertinent): ``It would have passed
in any case.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel and Hardy as Gogo and Didi? It's a destructively
seductive idea, but one that could also be instructive. Stan and
Ollie are not a one-shot team. Like Gogo and Didi, they have been
together forever.
</P>
<P>
   First paired by Hal Roach in the silent-film era, they went on
to make nearly 90 comedies, mostly two-reelers but also a number of
features, between 1926 and 1951. The best, the funniest, of these
evoke landscapes that are much like Beckett's: small, hermetically
sealed, forgotten by God.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Music Box,'' a short that won an Oscar in 1932, the
fate of mankind depends on the two men moving a shiny new grand
piano from the bottom of a steep hill to the top without smashing
it. Do they succeed? Does Godot ever arrive?
</P>
<P>
   Didi and Gogo are longtime collaborators. Each has the run of
the other's mind as if it were a familiar old flat, cluttered with
the detritus of a life no longer remembered, foul smelling,
perhaps, but safe. This is why even very good, more conventional
actors have problems playing ``Waiting for Godot.'' It requires a
degree of intimacy that has the force of second nature, as with
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Classic Stage Company production, directed by Andrei
Belgrader and supervised by David Esbjornson (his last assignment
after serving seven years as the company's artistic director), is
something of an all-star affair: John Turturro as Gogo and Tony
Shalhoub as Didi are the first among the equals, though each would
seem a better choice to play the other's role.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro is a big stage presence. He doesn't comfortably fit
into a part made to Stan Laurel's order. He has to work hard to
rein himself in. Shalhoub gives an intelligent reading of Didi's
lines but, being a physically smaller, more subtle actor, he would
seem to be a natural as Gogo. Together, Turturro and Shalhoub give
reasonable impersonations that never for a minute seem spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening moments of the play, Turturro wrestles with his
leg, twisting himself into the shape of a failed pretzel, trying to
remove a worn-out shoe from his aching foot. The audience applauds
the choreography of the shtick with rather more enthusiasm than it
laughs at the humor of what it sees.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar situation later on when Didi and Gogo do a
carefully worked out show business bit, supplied by Beckett. Each
trying to find the derby that suits him best, they stand side by
side, trying on and then passing to the other, one of three
beaten-up hats that remain in constant motion between them.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old vaudeville routine that can be achingly funny in the
way of sleight-of-hand. Here, it looks like something learned at
home and then performed for friends at a New Year's party.
</P>
<P>
   More successful are Christopher Lloyd, who is maniacal and blunt
as Pozzo, and Richard Spore, whose performance as Lucky, Pozzo's
slave, is remarkable as long as the character remains mute. Lucky
looks inert, but he is a ticking bomb inside a plain brown paper
parcel. When at last he goes off, delivering a crazily poetic
screed against a system he doesn't understand, the words get lost.
But then many of the words in this production evaporate in thin
air.
</P>
<P>
   About the derbies: in an Act I footnote, Beckett instructs that
Didi, Gogo, Pozzo and Lucky wear derbies. They were also integral
to the costumes that defined Stan and Ollie. When Laurel's
biographer asked him if derbies had been an idea stolen from
Charlie Chaplin, Laurel told him they had long been used by comics
to announce social pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   Derbies, he said, in a very Stanley-Gogo way, ``were in the
public domain.'' &QL;

haven't been able to score tickets for ``The Lion King.'' It's a
London import, ``Grimm Tales,'' the Young Vic Theater Company's
adaptation of six stories and one riddle taken from the collected
works of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   The physical production is minimal, using a small, raked, round
stage platform as the playing area, and only essential costumes and
props. All of which makes the show's theatricality more astonishing
and magical.
</P>
<P>
   The tales are narrated as they are acted, which distances some
of the Grand Guignol stage effects. Compared to what comes later,
the very funny scene in which the wolf swallows Little Red Riding
Hood (here called Red-Cap) and her grandmother is tame indeed. It
is accomplished with the wizardly use of a long swath of imitation
black fur. The tale of Ashputtel (Cinderella) is something else.
Ashputtel's wicked stepsisters draw real stage blood when one
amputates a toe in order to put on the fateful slipper, and the
other sacrifices a cutlet-sized portion of her heel.
</P>
<P>
   Such brightly grotesque brutality prompted squeals of laughter
among the younger theatergoers around me at a recent matinee. I'm
not so sure that some of the adults weren't a bit shocked, however.
We are probably the ones who will end up with the nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grimm Tales'' is a bold, inventive, sometimes enchanting
theatrical endeavor, performed with great good humor and energy by
the members of the talented cast. Carol Ann Duffy is responsible
for the adaptation and Tim Supple is the director. The engagement
continues until Jan. 3. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!'' is the title of the
latest installment of the long-running, irrepressibly irreverent
revue created and written by the tireless Gerard Alessandrini and
directed by Phillip George and Alessandrini. It is at a tiny boite,
rather grandly named the Stardust Theater, on Broadway at 51st
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets: Mayor Giuliani and his obsessive need to
clean up the city, the boys in ``Footloose'' who are thought to be
``a little too cute'' to be completely plausible, and ``The Beauty
Queen of Leenane,'' which inspires the song ``How Are Things in
Irish Drama?'' sung to the tune of ``How Are Things in Glocca
Morra?'' The answer: ``Glum, glum, glum.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are sendups of Karen Ziemba and Ute Lemper, who
replaced Ann Reinking and Bebe Neuwirth in ``Chicago,'' a
suggestion that Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner of ``Side Show'' had
themselves surgically joined to keep working, but then found they
had two left feet; funny, quite mean parodies of ``Titanic'' (both
the Broadway musical and the film); put-downs of body mikes and
Bernadette Peters, and a superb take on the male swans in ``Swan
Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately one third of the show is, in backstage vernacular,
delicious, and the cast of four divine: Bryan Batt, Lori Hammel,
Edward Staudenmayer and Kristine Zbornik. A hand also for Matthew
Ward, the musical director.
</P>
<P>
   A note of caution: the Stardust Theater is not for
claustrophobics. The room is small, cramped and just far enough
below street level to make you wonder where they keep the snorkels.

CONNECTICUT WOULD LOSE MONEY AS KRAFT GAINS, STUDY SAYS

   BOSTON _ A consultant's report on the feasibility of building a
$350 million stadium for the New England Patriots in Hartford,
Conn. concludes what some states and cities already know:
publicly-financed stadiums are money losers for many years for the
governments that build them, but can be very lucrative almost
immediately for team owners.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday by consulting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick, said Connecticut would lose money for the first 14 years
after it opened, but would eventually earn enough to pay for itself
over 30 years without taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   The state's profit, after borrowing $350 million to pay for
construction, would total just $3.2 million at the end of 30 years,
the state-commissioned report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the revenue projections in the report and future income from
the NFL television contract means that team owner Robert Kraft's
profits could reach $100 million by the fifth year of the stadium's
operation, according to a source close to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that Connecticut's demographics and per
capita income make the state lucrative NFL territory for the
68,000-seat, open-air facility. Connecticut is in the top half of
the league's media markets, and is home to 18 Fortune 500 companies
from which Kraft expects to draw customers willing to pay among the
highest prices in the league for luxury boxes and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   The state has even agreed to make up the difference if Kraft is
unable to sell all of the luxury seats, a guarantee that could cost
the state $17.5 million over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, it will be the best (deal) in the NFL, and
probably the best in professional sports,'' said Dean Bonham,
president of the Bonham Group, a Denver sports marketing consulting
firm. ``But I'm skeptical of the assumptions, particularly in the
premium seating area.''
</P>
<P>
   The luxury and club seating component is a key part of the deal,
given that the state would guarantee the sales of 75 sky boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury seating in the Hartford stadium could generate as much as
$45 million from 150 suites and 6,000 club seats _ far above the
$30 million in average premium seating revenue in markets such as
Washington, Tampa, Jacksonville, Charlotte, Nashville, and
Baltimore, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about $35,000 over the NFL average for suites,'' Bonham
said. ``You're talking about a market that is overbuilding by 50
the number of suites they should have ... and probably overpricing
them by $25,000 to $35,000 per suite.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report said the city could support the higher prices
because the Hartford metropolitan area has a high median income,
and there would be no competition for corporate spending on other
major league sports.
</P>
<P>
   What the study does not mention is that a chunk of Connecticut
tends to support New York football teams, especially the Giants, a
fact that could hurt overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   The $57,000 study also banked on successful corporate sales from
customers in smaller surrounding cities such as Springfield and
Worcester, Mass.; Providence, R.I.; and Stamford, and New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to the Patriots marketing department, 53
requests for luxury boxes have been registered with the team,
including nine from Boston. Foxboro Stadium, one of the oldest
facilities in the league, has only 42 suites.
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots expect continued involvement by many of these
companies at a new stadium in Hartford,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big assumption,'' Bonham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Connecticut Gov. John Rowland,
defended premium seating pricing, saying the product would be far
superior to that in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the price of a club seat in Hartford, it's attached to a
club and restaurant and they'll have year-round access to a health
club and conference and business facilities,'' Pagani said. ``It's
a much different product. It has a variety of privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   Underestimating all premium sales in its analysis, the report
assumed that 80 suites would be sold at $100,000 in 2001 and 6,000
club seats would be sold for $4,250.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted a number of ``intangible'' benefits _ such
as national media exposure and economic spinoff _ the team would
bring to Hartford, a city that is struggling to regain a vibrant
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pagani: ``Again, the focus of the report was to show the
stadium could pay for itself. That's what it does based on
conservative projections.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft will get at least 90 percent of the stadium's direct
revenues, which come from ticket sales, sales of the luxury boxes
and club seats, advertising inside the stadium, concessions,
souvenirs and parking. KPMG estimates that revenue will be $97
million in the first year of the arena's operation, rising to $114
million in the fifth year, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Kraft also will receive an estimated $80 million from
the NFL's lucrative television contracts, as well as another $14
million or so from the team owners' licensing agreement and profit
sharing from NFL Properties, NFL Films and NFL Enterprises -- a
total of about $200 million, according to a source familiar with
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   When his expenses are subtracted _ $84 million will be the
players' salary cap and another $10 million to $12 million for
coaches' salaries, travel and other costs _ his profit could reach
$100 million in the year 2005, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings in the report:
</P>
<P>
   -- Total public borrowing for the project could rise to $374
million after inflation over the 26-month construction period,
equaling $25.5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   -- The stadium would not generate enough revenue to cover that
$25.5 million in annual debt until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   -- The third year of construction would be the most costly for
the state, putting taxpayers on the hook for $20.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thirty years after the stadium is built, however, the state
would receive a projected $44 million in net revenue from the
facility over a 12-month period -- the largest annual amount over
the life of the 30-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   -- The greatest generator of direct stadium revenue would be $41
million in ticket sales in the first year, followed by $30 million
in premium seating, $12.6 million in concessions, $2.3 million in
souvenir sales, and $2 million in parking. The state would receive
a 10 percent tax on all of that spending.
</P>
<P>
   -- In addition, the state would receive the corporate and income
taxes generated by the team, an amount expected to grow as the
league's payroll skyrockets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Raw revenues would increase dramatically over time _ from
$15.6 million in 2001, the first year open, to $77.3 million 30
years later.
</P>
<P>
   -- KPMG estimated the cost of repairing and maintaining the
stadium would range from $1.6 million a year to $7.7 million,
adjusted for inflation, over the life of the deal. Those capital
costs were factored into the overall calculations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The report projected $7.2 million in attendee spending
outside the stadium in the facility's first year of operation on
such things as hotels, restaurants, retail and transportation. That
figure would grow to $8.2 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   A public hearing on the plan is scheduled for Dec. 9. The
General Assembly, whose Democratic leadership supports the
Republican governor's proposal, is due to vote on the measure in a
special session Dec. 15.

CARPET COMPANY FINED FOR ILLEGAL DONATIONS TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the country's largest carpet manufacturers,
Beaulieu of America Inc. of Dalton was fined $1 million Tuesday
after pleading guilty to federal misdemeanor charges that it made
$36,000 in illegal contributions to Lamar Alexander's campaign for
1996 Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The company is headed by Carl Bouckaert, a Belgian citizen who
was one of the roughly 30 finance co-chairmen of Alexander's 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its plea, the company acknowledged that it skirted
rules prohibiting corporate contributions to presidential campaigns
by instructing employees to make donations and then reimbursing
them with payments identified as bonuses or expense reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement, which was negotiated between the company and
the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta, absolves Alexander's campaign of any
responsibility for the illegal donations. ``As a result of the
defendant's conduct,'' the agreement states, ``the Alexander for
President Committee unwittingly and incorrectly reported as
individual contributions what were in fact at least $36,000 in
corporate contributions funneled through conduits.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Culvahouse, a lawyer for Alexander's 1996 campaign
committee, said the committee plans to refund the $36,000 to
Beaulieu of America. ``There were 22,000 contributions to Alexander
for President,'' Culvahouse said in a statement. ``This is the only
instance like this we have heard about and we hope it is the
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a former Republican governor of Tennessee and former
U.S. secretary of education, is considering running for president
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to imposing the $1 million criminal fine, the plea
agreement states that the Justice Department will recommend that
the Federal Election Commission impose a civil fine of $200,000
against the company. The terms of the agreement were disclosed
Tuesday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Rome, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckaert, the company's chief executive, was not charged
individually as part of the plea agreement. But the agreement calls
for him to perform at least 200 hours of community service as part
of the 500 hours of service required of the company's officers.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the company state that Bouckaert hosted a
fund-raising dinner in Dalton for Alexander on March 8, 1995, and
that corporate officers directed at least 36 employees and employee
spouses to buy $1,000 tickets. The company later reimbursed the
employees, according to the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu of America is a privately held company founded by
Bouckaert in 1978 as a unit of the Beaulieu Group of Belgium. It
employs more than 8,000 workers in plants around the country, most
of them in northwest Georgia, Bowers said.

CONRADT KEEPS TEXAS PROGRAM ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Jody Conradt has vague memories of her leisurely
pursuit of Scottsdale recruit Ellen Bayer _ and of a time when only
a few teams, including hers, dominated women's college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, recruiting is at the forefront of college women's
basketball and can be a losing battle for even the winningest coach
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   With two sub-.500 seasons out of the past four and a 1-3 start,
the University of Texas is in sore need of the talent to match the
tradition that threatens to turn Conradt into a museum piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep looking to see if I'm dead,'' said the 57-year-old,
inducted two months ago into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall
of Fame. Conradt, in her 23rd season at Texas and 30th as a college
coach, is among 26 inaugural inductees into the Women's Basketball
Hall of Fame, which will open in the spring in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Conradt, in fact, is alive and in Tempe for her team's first
appearance against Arizona State (2-1), a program with three NCAA
Tournament appearances, compared with the Longhorns' 14, two Final
Fours and 1986 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've won a national championship and had the success
they've had, anything less is unacceptable,'' said Arizona State
Coach Charli Turner Thorne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more parity and teams don't dominate anymore,
and Jody's had to suffer that in recent years. But she's still as
great a coach as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne was a senior point guard at Stanford in 1987-88,
the year it lost in the NCAA Sweet Sixteen to Texas. As an
assistant coach at Washington and Santa Clara, she was 1-2 against
the Horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that's given me is a tremendous respect for
their program,'' said the 32-year-old, in her third season at ASU.
``Obviously Jody has shown an ability to continue to adjust and
adapt. She flat-out knows how to teach her kids to win. To win over
the long run, you have to be able to teach that mentality, not just
the Xs and Os.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Texas accomplished the first undefeated NCAA
title run, culminating with a victory over Southern California in
Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller's final collegiate game, Conradt signed
Bayer, a 6-foot-8 center out of Scottsdale Saguaro High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came'' to the Valley to court Bayer, ``I only came
once,'' Conradt said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the current recruiting environment, she must invite
juniors to campus to sway them early with the still-fervent
atmosphere in Austin. Four of the premier prospects in Texas, and
the nation, were among more than 10,000 people at the Erwin Center
on Saturday for an 86-65 loss to three-time defending national
champion Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting is such an unrealistic situation,'' Conradt said.
``It's very difficult to go through that process and know that the
more highly recruited an athlete is, the longer it's going to take
them to get back to reality once they become a college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 15-, 16-, 17-year-old hears from hundreds of adults how
wonderful they are, sometimes it's difficult to cut away what's
real and what is flattery. Most of us would be influenced by that,
and it has become so distasteful from the coaching standpoint and
damaging to young people. It's hard to justify what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What adult wants to write a note to a 16-year-old every day
for two years? We're not observing to evaluate talent, but to make
an impression. It's about who's going to come first and most.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, who grew to 6-9 while at Texas and remains the tallest
player in school history by five inches, is a throwback to the days
when players were hooked simply by the allure of the Horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not a basketball player when she came, just a tall
young woman,'' said Conradt, who would have redshirted the shy
Bayer had she not worried about her quitting the game if she
weren't around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of the most competitive people I've coached, but
it didn't surface in the normal way. Her skills didn't allow that
until late in her junior and senior years. At that point, she had
enough skill to brutalize people and became a tremendous shot
blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   The best in Texas history (289) and among the top 20 all-time in
NCAA Division I. ``By the time she left (in 1990), she was just
becoming a basketball player,'' Conradt said.
</P>
<P>
   But torn knee ligaments two years later prevented Bayer from
going overseas to play, and she was too far removed from the game
to turn a tryout at the American Basketball League combine last
spring into a job.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer could not be reached for comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Conradt's 593 Texas wins (she has 710 total) are over
Arizona and Northern Arizona, but her initial intersection with ASU
finds the programs in an oddly similar place.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are hoping to build on a 10-win season, their
first in double digits in five years. Texas is trying to prove that
12-15 was an anomaly. Both are coming off a loss last week to
11th-ranked Rutgers: the Horns, 66-59 in Austin; ASU, 67-48 in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of those games and common sense favors Texas
tonight. But the Horns already have a road loss to Houston, 61-52,
and is a post-thin team without 6-4 Carla Littleton, who reinjured
the right knee that kept sidelined her all last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now when teams traditionally not in the Horns' league get
lathered up, they have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the state itself has sort of a mystique, that everything
is bigger and better,'' Conradt said. ``We enjoy that. But the
other part of it, that's hard for teams I've coached to understand,
is why everybody hates us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year you're here as a player, the one thing you
learn is people don't want to beat you, they want to tear your
heart out.'' &QL;

PLAYOFF-SAVVY JACKE JOINS CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Chris Jacke was asked his assessment of the
kicking conditions at the Cardinals' practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeccable,'' he said. ``There's 70-degree weather. The grass
is green, not painted.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't remind him of the eight seasons he spent in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll carry around a bag of ice to feel at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke was so excited about winning the Cardinals' place-kicking
job in a tryout Tuesday, he kept reeling off one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   On his attire of shorts and a T-shirt: ``I had to buy the stuff
when I got down here.''
</P>
<P>
   On what he needs to do in practice over the next three days: ``I
have to teach the field-goal holder how to hold for a right-footed
kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke was kidding about the clothes. He wasn't joking about
spending a lot of time with punter Scott Player, the team's holder
who hadn't worked with a right-footed kicker until Jacke and Tucson
native Cole Ford attended Monday's tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down and sat on the (wrong) side the first time, I'm so
used to doing it from the other side all year,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   Player has held for Joe Nedney, who suffered a season-ending
knee injury in Sunday's loss at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney watched the tryout along with Cardinals coaches,
personnel staff and other members of the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't miss,'' said Nedney, who met Jacke in 1995 when he
was trying out with the Packers to be their kickoff specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke didn't miss a field-goal try during the workout. He also
hit all of his kickoffs inside the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin knows a lot about him. From 1989 to
'92, Tobin faced Jacke twice a year when he was defensive
coordinator for the Chicago Bears and Jacke was with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin knew that Jacke had 15 game-winning kicks at Green Bay and
was 70 of 73 from inside 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been to Super Bowl and won them,'' Tobin said.
``Hopefully, some of that can rub off.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's experience is a big reason why Tobin brought him and
Ford to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some younger kickers we opted not to bring in
here,'' Tobin said. ``We're coming down to crunch time this season,
and with the pressure of the moment, we needed someone who had been
there and done that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eight seasons in Green Bay, Jacke has attempted 22 field
goals in the fourth quarter or overtime of close games. He made 19
of those kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he had been out of the league for nearly two seasons. He
didn't re-sign with the Packers in 1997 because of a contract
dispute and went to Pittsburgh instead. But he suffered an upper
thigh injury at training camp and was cut early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke signed with the Washington Redskins late in the year and
played in the final game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he had tryouts with Denver, Jacksonville, Oakland and
San Francisco before landing with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beginning to have a lot of doubts whether I'd play this
season,'' said Jacke, who had been working as an intern at American
Express in Green Bay but kept in shape by kicking on his own and
working with a personal trainer. ``I knew it was going to take a
situation like this with someone getting hurt or someone not
performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here not expecting a lot. If it didn't work out, I'd go
back to work in Green Bay. I don't know how long this will last. I
know the Cardinals are quite happy with Joe (Nedney). But I want to
prove I still can kick in this league.'' &QL;

<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ An autopsy was completed Tuesday on the
body of Janette Piro, wife of missing Singer Island resident
Christopher Benedetto, but the Palm Beach County medical examiner's
office did not release a cause and manner of death. Benedetto has
been missing since the couple broke a dinner date with neighbors
Nov. 11. Piro's body was found Nov. 23 in a freezer in the couple's
garage at 1160 Dolphin Road. Police are not releasing any more
details in the case, police Maj. David Harris said Tuesday.

 &HT;    New Bowl Championship Series even more flawed than old system
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's T-minus four and counting until college football's bowls
fill up and the sour milk spills over the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Any system that leaves a team like 10-1 Miami at home is
horribly flawed to start with, but this system _ this new Bowl
Championship Series system _ should be euthanized at first
opportunity. Dr. Kevorkian, please check your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote last week that in trying to fix a broken system, the BCS
broke it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I meant:
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, as many as three or four bowls might have
national championship implications. That was a broken system, a
1938 Packard by the side of the road with smoke coming out the
front and back, because in the end, after the bowls were played, it
relied on subjective judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The next system, the so-called Alliance, managed to get everyone
together except the Big 10 and Pac-10; like a United Nations
without Russia and Germany. That was a broken system, a set of
railroad tracks that ended at a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone is together, but if you think when Sunday's
pairings come out that the No. 1 and 2 teams in the country will be
playing in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, your faith in hocus-pocus is
stronger than mine.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who No. 1 and 2 are, and neither does this system
with its computers and voters and magic beans.
</P>
<P>
   As I said last week, I think Florida State and Ohio State are
the best teams, but neither is likely to end the season in the sand
of Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State and Ohio State each have one loss. I concede that.
But check the unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won a game in overtime, beat Oregon State (4-5 at the time)
on a last-minute Hail Mary and beat Stanford (1-6 at the time) when
Stanford fumbled the ball one step from the goal line as it was
about to go in for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is good, but that's two too many squeezes for me to believe
there aren't 10 teams at least as good.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won a game when Arkansas, leading and running out the
clock at game's end, watched its quarterback fumble without being
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State beat Nebraska with the help of two blatantly bogus
officiating calls, then had trouble with a Missouri team that Ohio
State tossed around the field like spare change.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State played the entire season with its No. 2
quarterback, then the No. 3 quarterback won its showdown with
Florida. How strong is that?
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's only loss _ in fact its only close game _ came on a
series of freak plays, including a short Michigan State punt that
hit an OSU blocker in the back and led to a Michigan State
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   I have difficulty with the concept that a Stanford kid fumbles
as he's about to beat UCLA, and an Arkansas kid fumbles untouched
as the Razorbacks are about to beat Tennessee, yet those plays have
more weight than a punt that bounces crazily and hits an Ohio State
kid in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there are no great teams this season, just a lot
of good ones. Thus this season more than most begs for a playoff
system.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: Play the bowls the way they were played long ago.
Then a committee _ just like the one that selects the field for the
basketball tournament _ chooses four teams and in two weeks you've
got an actual, on-field champion.
</P>
<P>
   Every other NCAA sport from field hockey to fencing to water
polo plays it out. Every other division of NCAA football plays it
out. Only Division I-A football flails blindly to a pale,
unsatisfying conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series is a fraud.

 &HT;    Prison officials scale back search
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State prison officials, still convinced that a
killer who escaped from death row is hiding near the Ellis Unit
north of Huntsville, said Tuesday they are scaling back their
search, hoping the reduced activity would lull the fugitive into
making a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically going to cut back the search in that area,''
prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said, referring to a 17,000-acre
area around the prison that has been at the center of a massive
search since Martin Gurule jumped the prison fences early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the inmate the illusion that it's okay to run,
and hopefully he'll make a mistake,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of
Criminal Justice, announced the suspension of the work program that
gave Gurule, as well as the six other death row inmates who
attempted to escape with him, greater freedom within their
cellblock and greater opportunity to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-third of death row's 454 inmates are on
``work-capable'' status, which allows them to work in the adjacent
garment factory or in janitorial service with less direct
supervision by prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which began in 1983 as part of a class-action
lawsuit related to prison crowding, gives inmates perks like larger
cells and the ability to leave their cells _ their cells doors open
automatically every hour _ to go to the day room or recreation yard
while other inmates remain locked in their cells 23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said a special committee will evaluate the program and
report to prison board member Mac Stringfellow, who expects to
finish his review in time for a January prison board meeting in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member committee will be headed by an independent
professional investigator who Polunsky did not name and will also
include representatives of different branches of the prison system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure the people of Texas that we will bring back
this fugitive,'' Polunsky said. ``We will bring him back dead or
alive and it really doesn't make any difference in my opinion which
that might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, was one of seven death row inmates who cut through a
recreation yard fence with a hacksaw blade Thanksgiving night and
hid on the roof of a prison building for several hours before their
escape attempt shortly after midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule scaled two 10-foot high fences topped with razor wire and
disappeared into the nearby woods. The other six inmates
surrendered when guards, alerted when Gurule tripped a motion
detector on the outer fence, opened fire with automatic rifles. It
is not known if Gurule was wounded by the gunfire or injured by the
razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was sent to death row for the 1992 robbery-murder of
Minas ``Mike'' Piperis, the co-owner of the U&AMP;I Restaurant in
Corpus Christi. Gurule also was charged with killing restaurant
employee Anthony Staton, but that case did not go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   After putting as many as 500 corrections officers and police on
the search team for the past five days, prison officials said they
will cut back that number by about one-half, using more mounted
patrols and eliminating many of the foot patrols around their
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Glen Castlebury said the prison dog teams,
which have been running along about a dozen trails 24 hours a day,
will now conduct random runs through the woods and bogs within the
search area.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters will still be part of the search effort, and on
Tuesday, more high-tech equipment was added when the Texas National
Guard brought in a helicopter able to detect heat sources on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told it can pick up a live turtle from several hundred
feet in the air, and it did not find any escaped inmate,'' prison
spokesman Larry Todd said after the helicopter's first day in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   While searchers continued scouring the ground, prison officials
pressed their own investigations on Gurule and how he became the
first inmate to escape from death row since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The prison system's gang expert, Sammy Buentello, said he is
investigating rumors that Gurule was part of the Mexican Mafia
prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have him ID'd as a member of any gang,'' Buentello
said. ``We had people saying he was, and we're checking that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Houston Chronicle reported and prison
spokesman Larry Todd later confirmed, that two other death row
inmates tried to escape in virtually the same manner more than a
year ago but were foiled when they were spotted by a tower guard.
</P>
<P>
   Prison records reviewed by the newspaper showed that, like
Gurule and his colleagues, convicted killers Willie Pondexter and
Cedric Ransom cut through a recreation yard fence with a hacksaw
blade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Walker County Sheriff's Office is investigating
two burglaries within a mile of the prison in which residents
reported bedding, clothes, knives and food stolen. Both burglaries
were reported within 36 hours of Gurule's escape.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gurule's escape, Fitzgerald said prison authorities have
received a number of ``ghost calls'' from people who claim they
spotted Gurule in restaurants, churches, even in the company of a
transvestite in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman offered to let them use her Chihuahua to track
Gurule _ as long as they let her relative out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sapp is still wondering whether Gurule was the person who
broke into her mobile home in Riverside Harbor, a small subdivision
less than a mile down farm-to-market road 980 from the Ellis Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp said she left her home around 10:30 a.m. Thanksgiving day
and returned around 9 p.m. Friday to find her porch light unplugged
and a number of items missing: blankets and pillows from two beds,
a paring knife and a larger kitchen knife, a half-dozen cans of
soup, two eggs, some jewelry, and two pairs of jeans. More valuable
items like the television and a laptop computer were not taken, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy James, a detective sergeant at the Walker County Sheriff's
Office, said an investigation found no usable fingerprints and no
sign of forced entry. James said her office gave details of the
burglary to prison authorities, and Fitzgerald, the prison
spokesman, said prison investigators ``determined that (burglary
report) was not one they were concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp said she's been staying with her boyfriend ever since and
doesn't plan to sleep at home for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, another resident near the prison reported a set of
sheets, garbage bags, toilet paper, and cleaning supplies missing.
James said fingerprints recovered from a broken window pane did not
match Gurule's.

 &HT;    Cornyn to look into tobacco suit
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Once he takes office next year, Texas Attorney
General-elect John Cornyn promised Tuesday that he will scrutinize
the state's $17.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry and
see whether private attorneys hired to represent the state acted
against the state's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's premature for me to know what I'm going to do,''
Cornyn said. ``I do intend to ask some questions. That's just one
of the things I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's reiterated concerns he and other opponents made in a
bitter and protracted fight over how much a handful of private
lawyers would be paid as as result of Attorney General Dan Morales'
tobacco lawsuit settlement, which had been the largest legal
settlement in history until last month, when several other states
announced a joint settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He raised the possibility of an inquiry during a Capitol press
conference called to announce four key appointments in his new
administration. Two of these appointments signaled Cornyn's
campaign resolve to tackle the attorney general's beleaguered
child-support enforcement division and bolster its criminal law
enforcement role.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning of his campaign for attorney general, Cornyn
sued to challenge Morales' authority to hire the private lawyers on
a contingency basis to handle the tobacco lawsuit. Morales hired
the lawyers with contracts that promised a 15 percent contingency
fee if the state recovered public money spent on treating
smoking-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   At 15 percent, the lawyers stood to recover as much as $2.3
billion or more _ itself the largest contingency payment in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's asked the Texas Supreme Court to decide what authority
Morales had to hire the private lawyers. Later, seven state
legislators and Gov. George W. Bush, in separate actions, sued to
intervene in the tobacco case itself.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments that the challengers made over the fees award,
various opponents raised the possibility that the private lawyers
breached their fiduciary duty to their client, the state, in part
by devising a settlement that paid them with money the opponents
claimed should have gone to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' spokesman, Ron Dusek, said Tuesday that Morales _ not
the private lawyers he hired to handle the trial _ negotiated the
tobacco deal. ``He has said very clearly that Texas, at the time
the deal was negotiated, had the best deal of any state involved in
the tobacco litigation,'' Dusek said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tobacco settlement, the private lawyers first would be
paid by the tobacco companies to the extent that three arbitrators
set their fee. The federal judge supervising the tobacco case also
awarded them their 15 percent fee, leaving open the possibility
that they could recover any difference from the state if the
arbitrators granted them less.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Bush and others, who reached a settlement
deal with Morales, Cornyn later dropped his legal challenge to the
payment arrangement, but never dropped his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His comments about wanting to question the fee arrangement in
his official capacity comes at a time when the arbitration panel
begins to review the case and determine what fees the attorneys
should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cornyn moved on other fronts as he makes his
transition into office.
</P>
<P>
   His tapped Howard Baldwin as deputy attorney general in charge
of child-support enforcement. Baldwin, now with the Department of
Protective and Regulatory Services, helped his Democratic opponent
Jim Mattox set up a child support court-master program when Mattox
was attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin later served as master in San Antonio. His successor,
family law Judge Jim Rausch, said Tuesday that Baldwin was a wise
choice because of his knowledge of the system and his relationship
with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the ins and outs of the child-support program
probably better than anyone else,'' Rausch said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn also announced Shane Phelps, who once headed Attorney
General Dan Morales' prosecutors assistance division before he ran
for Travis County district attorney, as deputy in charge of
criminal justice, and Andy Taylor of Houston as his first
assistant. Cornyn said Taylor would be his ``right-hand man.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a law partner with former Attorney General and Texas
Chief Justice John Hill, was Cornyn's campaign treasurer. He also
was instrumental in Hill's reply to critics who cited Cornyn as
leading among justices in the percentage of their campaign
contributions from lawyers and parties with cases before the court.

CONSEQUENCES OF PERJURY DEBATED IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee held a
nine-hour hearing Tuesday on the consequences of perjury, seeking
to stoke support in the House for impeaching President Clinton on
that charge.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats argued that Republicans had failed to prove
that Clinton had deliberately lied under oath to conceal his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Other Democrats said that if the
president had lied about the matter, it would not be an impeachable
offense. Even the Republicans' witnesses were divided on whether
the House should impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican witnesses differed from their colleagues in their
opinions on impeachment. ``I'd recommend you not vote for
impeachment,'' said Judge Charles Wiggins, a senior judge on the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who was a California Republican
on the Judiciary Committee in 1974. Wiggins, who called the
evidence against Clinton ``vague,'' had voted against impeaching
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The other witness, Adm. Leon Edney, a retired four-star officer
who testified on the corrosive effects of lying in the military,
said in an interview, ``I'm not advocating impeachment. I think
it'd be deleterious and would not be healthy for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the highly partisan hearing that featured a parade of
witnesses, from convicted perjurers to federal judges to a
decorated Army general who has retired, Republicans tried to
underscore perjury's harmful effects on the nation's justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If citizens are allowed to lie with impunity _ or encourage
others to tell false stories or hide evidence _ judges and juries
cannot reach just results,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the courtroom becomes an arena for artful liars
and the jury a mere focus group choosing between alternative
fictions,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee expected to approve at least one article of
impeachment next week, House Republican aides say a vote on the
House floor to impeach Clinton on a perjury count, which has the
best chance of passing, would be too close to call. Republican
committee aides are also drawing up counts of obstruction of
justice and witness tampering, and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, and the witnesses they called, said that while
Clinton's conduct was wrong and should be punished, his offenses
were, according to one retired judge, no worse than lying about a
speeding violation and did not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not simply to abide by the public's understanding
of lying,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas. ``Our charge is
to determine whether these are impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized a series of new Republican subpoenas
approved Tuesday in a party-line vote that broadened the
investigation into the president's 1996 campaign finance practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are indeed in a wild goose chase of the week,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., who cited the Republicans' fruitless detour
this week into questioning of witnesses about whether they
influenced the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who accused Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance
outside the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, barely controlling his anger, replied that the committee
was not engaged in a wild goose chase and was not confined to the
referral from Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's proceeding was in many ways a two-part hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first part, lawmakers heard testimony from two convicted
perjurers, whose remorseful, sometimes tearful comments seemed to
turn the cavernous, wood-paneled hearing room into a giant
confessional.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they called the perjurers to show the personal
consequences faced by some offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, I could finally say I'm guilty,'' said Pam Parsons,
a former women's basketball coach at the University of South
Carolina. She went to prison for four months in 1984, after a
perjury conviction for her testimony in a civil libel lawsuit she
filed against Sports Illustrated. The magazine reported that Ms.
Parsons had had a lesbian relationship with a team player and
recruited players with ``sex in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Tuesday that she had lied under oath about whether she
had visited a lesbian bar called Puss 'n Boots in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Battalino, a former Veterans Affairs psychiatrist at a
medical center in Idaho, lied in a civil deposition about whether
``anything of a sexual nature'' occurred in her office with a man
who was a Vietnam veteran seeking psychiatric help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very real sense, I am condemned to a life sentence,''
said Dr. Battalino, who is currently under house arrest in Idaho.
``I have lost my professional standing, my life as it had been, and
my cherished privacy _ these consequences are irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, the tone turned serious as lawmakers grilled
a new panel of law professors, judges and retired military officers
on the seriousness of perjury and under what circumstances lying
would amount to an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said that Clinton had engaged in a
``pattern'' of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said, ``I'm concerned that some have
tried to diminish perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But the three law professors, a former federal judge and a
former attorney general summoned by the Democrats said there were
no grounds for impeachment. Many recommended a censure instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As serious a crime as perjury is, there exists a spectrum of
gravity with regard to false statements,'' said Judge A. Leon
Higginbotham Jr., a retired federal appellate court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham said there were perjuries that cause harm to the
country, for example, if the president had lied about selling
nuclear secrets to a foreign agent. The judge said the lesser
versions would include any lie under oath by the president about a
speeding violation. Higginbotham equated Clinton's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky to the speeding violation.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Richardson, a former attorney general under President
Nixon, said that if committee members had decided in advance that
removing the president from office was too harsh a penalty for the
offense, impeachment was ``pointless,'' and lawmakers should adopt
an alternative, like censure.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the nine-hour hearing, tempers grew short.
Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School who testified
that no ordinary citizen would be prosecuted for what Clinton did,
criticized the Republican-led inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is openly trivializing the rule of law,''
Dershowitz said. ``All Republicans care about is the perjury
committed by one Democrat'' _ Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, his lips pursed tightly, wagged his finger at Dershowitz
and shot back, ``You have disparaged us by leaping to
conclusions.''

EXPERTS, FOES AGREE COYOTES ARE `FOR REAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ The ``Keeper of the Cup'' swore he would be
back. In fact, he guaranteed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we always make sure a city sees it more than once,''
Walter Neubrand said last spring when he toted the Stanley Cup on
its three-day visit to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of more than 50 stops that Neubrand, an employee of
the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, and hockey's Holy Grail, the
NHL's championship trophy, made during the Cup's three-month
``tour'' of North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another couple, three years,'' Neubrand said, ``I'm sure
you'll see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a lot sooner than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes' incredible start _ a league-leading 14-2-2
mark entering tonight's game in Edmonton _ has many observers
around the league talking up the Valley's team not only as a
legitimate ``contender'' to win the Stanley Cup, but perhaps the
``favorite''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think they're for real,'' said Barry Melrose, a
hockey studio analyst for ESPN and former head coach of the Los
Angeles Kings. ``I thought they were for real the last couple
years, for that matter, but they underachieved for all that talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can they win the Cup? Absolutely. A couple things have to
happen, but yeah, I'd definitely put them at the front of the
pack.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Melrose tempers those thoughts, adding 18 games into
the season is still early to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not how you start a season, it's how you end it,''
Melrose said. ``But the've got all the tools. They've got excellent
goaltending. They've got solid defensemen who can move the puck.
They've got great forwards, two or three lines than can score. And
if they stay healthy and continue to battle, no question about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the Stanley Cup going to Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to the Arizona Rattlers, who have laid claim to
two Arena Football League championships, but a real major league
title team in the Valley? A Stanley Cup in the desert before an NBA
crown by the Suns, desert dwellers for more than 30 years? A
Stanley Cup before a Super Bowl by the Cardinals, who've been
around for 100 years, the past 11 in Arizona? A Stanley Cup before
a World Series by the young, but free-spending Diamondbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that Coyote team a lot,'' said Scotty Bowman, head
coach of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red
Wings. ``They're playing like they've got something to prove this
year. And lately, they've been proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman made that comment nearly a month ago, a day before the
Coyotes defeated his Red Wings, 3-1, on Nov. 6. That victory gave
Phoenix its fourth straight win at the time after a 2-2 tie in
Anaheim on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes haven't been derailed since, running all the way to
the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   They are on a franchise-record, 14-game unbeaten streak
(12-0-2). They have won eight games in a row, one shy of tying
another club mark. Their winning percentage of .833 is tied for the
sixth-best winning percentage after 18 games in NHL history, and
four of the five teams above them made the finals in their
respective seasons. And if they hold the Oilers to two goals or
fewer tonight, it will be the 18th consecutive time they've done it
to the opposition, one shy of tying the Montreal Canadiens'
modern-era NHL record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a defense play this well or two goaltenders
completely shut down people like this in a long, long time,'' said
former NHL goalie John Davidson, an analyst for the FOX network.
``It's been an incredible run by the Phoenix Coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld has done his best to downplay all
the hype surrounding his team, which only figures to increase this
week during the team's trip to hockey-hungry Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won the Stanley Cup,'' he said. ``We're 100 miles
from where we want to be as a team and where we have to be as a
team. I think your recognition comes during the springtime, when
you're playing in May and you're playing in June and you're winning
playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   If they keep it up, they will. According to Melrose's ESPN
colleague Bill Clement, there are four key components why the
Coyotes are a Cup contender:
</P>
<P>
   The break between games in the early part of the schedule has
allowed the players to rest and the coaches to coach.
</P>
<P>
   An attention to defense first, especially by 22-year-old Oleg
Tverdovsky, has made a strong group of blueliners even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The team's top two players, left wing Keith Tkachuk and center
Jeremy Roenick, have proved they can co-exist and thrive on the No.
1 line as their combined 18 goals and 42 points attest.
</P>
<P>
   And, as they have evolved into a team, they have learned as a
team, specifically Schoenfeld, a career .500 coach in the NHL prior
to this season, who has done some of his best work with
less-talented teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've been able to accomplish this far is terrific,''
Clement said, ``and I don't think it's a farce at all. They're
definitely one of the teams people are going to have to contend
with.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, the Coyotes weren't even picked to make
the playoffs by a few publications. Veteran forward Rick Tocchet,
who won a Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992, prefers
the underdog role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you'll hear stuff like, `What about those
Coyotes?' '' Tocchet said, ``but then you'll turn around and hear
something like, ``Well, yeah. But how 'bout them Toronto Maple
Leafs?' I kind of like that. I like us waltzing into rinks and
waltzing out.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if they have taken the NHL by surprise, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper,'' said Vancouver Canucks Coach Mike Keenan,
``they've always looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one damn good team over there,'' Tampa Bay Lightning
Coach/General Manager Jacques Demers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing everything right,'' Chicago Blackhawks
defenseman Chris Chelios said.
</P>
<P>
   During last Saturday's game against the Kings, the Coyotes
looked like anything but a Cup contender in the opening 20 minutes.
But in the second period, they scored three goals on their way to
an easy 4-0 win, which didn't exactly shock Los Angeles Coach Larry
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got soft,'' he said, ``and when you play against a team as
talented as Phoenix, you know they're not going to give you a lot
of chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to the Coyotes' goaltending duo of Jimmy Waite and
Nikolai Khabibulin, who rank first and second in the NHL with
goals-against averages of 1.15 and 1.57 and save percentages of
.956 and .938. A true Stanley Cup-type team, they say, can only go
as far as its goalies can carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and it's the sign of a great team. A first-place
team that can't seem to lose after two months of the season. The
Coyotes, though, have advanced beyond the first round of the
playoffs only twice in their 20-year NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, my friend,'' Melrose said, ``will change this year.'' &QL;

PLAYERS AND NBA TO TALK WITHOUT ANY PRECONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 15 days away from the bargaining table, players
and owners on Thursday will make another bid to resuscitate the
National Basketball Association season.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter telephoned league
commissioner David Stern on Tuesday to set up the meeting as the
lockout entered its sixth month.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Manhattan will include full bargaining teams from
each side. There will be only one pre-meeting stipulation: every
issue on the table will be negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no preconditions,'' said deputy commissioner
Russ Granik. ``Whatever proposals we made two weeks ago, we're not
bound to. Whatever was put on the table at the last meeting is now
undone. I'm not optimistic, but like said I number of times, it
doesn't usually hurt to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, players missed their second payday. Union president
Patrick Ewing, who was due to earn $18.5 million this season, has
now lost nearly $4 million in salary. Total player salary losses
are projected above $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Concern is mounting on both sides as to whether the season will
actually be canceled. The NBA has refused to set an official
deadline, but if no deal is struck by mid-December the feeling
among many of the NBA's 29 owners is that there is no point in
having less than a 45-game season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The league has refused to use a mediator and will not declare an
impasse in negotiations, a tactic that major-league baseball
unsuccessfully used in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it will take a month after an agreement is reached
for the season to begin, it would not be surprising if the league
soon announced the cancellation of the All-Star Game Feb. 14 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If the league were to cancel the All-Star game, it would most
likely award Philadelphia the game in 2002. The NBA has already
committed itself to holding the event in San Francisco in 2000 and
in Washington for the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is the first since Nov. 20 in New York _ a 10-hour
affair that seemed to produce the most encouraging signs of a
possible settlement. Within two days, that progress was dashed when
the union and the league clashed over key economic issues. A
misunderstanding over how an escrow system would be implemented in
the fourth, fifth and sixth years of a seven-year plan led to
breakoff of the talks again.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, 10 hours of bargaining went to waste. While both
sides had moved off their desired numbers for total revenue
distribution _ the NBA wanted the players to make no more than 53
percent of income and the players proposed a 57-43 split, the
league is back to asking for a 50-50 share and the players want up
to 60 percent of the revenue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Refunds on the Way
</P>
<P>
   National Basketball Association teams are sending out refund
checks this week to season ticket holders for games that have not
been played. Each team must send back a pro-rated share of each
season ticket, along with 6 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams have five business days from today to send out the
checks,'' said NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets offered season ticket holders cash refunds
or credits for four canceled home regular season games and one
canceled exhibition game, said Jim Lampariello, an executive vice
president of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of credits included additional tickets for games
later this season if the lockout ends, or playoff tickets. About 70
percent chose refunds, which the team will start mailing out
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks only offered fans cash refunds, and checks
were being mailed out Tuesday for five home regular season games
and two exhibition games, said Barry Watkins, a spokesman for
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   People with individual game tickets can get cash refunds at
outlets where the tickets were purchased.

HALL WINS 2ND COURT ROUND, BUT STRUGGLES IN POOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Gary Hall Jr. won a second round in court Tuesday but
failed to get beyond the preliminaries in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Hall finished 13th in the 100-meter freestyle at College
Station, Texas, about 15 minutes after a federal judge in Phoenix
upheld a restraining order that allowed him to compete in the World
Cup despite a drug suspension by swimming's Swiss-based governing
body, FINA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an emotional roller-coaster for me,'' said Hall, who
won two gold and two silver medals at the 1996 Olympics. ``I did
have to contest this in court late last night and very early this
morning, so I'm not running on much sleep here. It makes it
difficult to concentrate on swimming, which is what I'm here for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's been a six-month suspension. I feel it's
punishment enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was warming up at the Texas A&AMP;M pool for his first
competition in more than six months as deliberations were under way
in Judge Roger Strand's courtroom in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Strand stood by his initial order, issued Monday night, after
hearing from Hall's attorneys and representatives of FINA, which
suspended the Phoenix swimmer for a positive marijuana test.
</P>
<P>
   FINA replied Tuesday morning with a 13-page fax from its offices
in Lausanne. Attorney Raymond Lembke of Cincinnati also argued in
FINA's behalf from his office in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   FINA contended that the Phoenix sprinter is still under
suspension. The restraining order would undercut FINA's ability to
enforce rules, according to Lembke, who said the governing body was
in jeopardy of becoming ``a toothless tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strand's decision sided with Hall attorney Ed Hendricks, who
argued that FINA had ``manipulated'' the terms of the suspension.
Hendricks said it should have begun on May 15, the day of the
positive test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hall has been precluded from swimming in critical
international events for almost 100 days,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   In a confusing scenario, the suspension started on June 15. But
FINA temporarily lifted it on Aug. 11 as it tried to determine
whether Hall's positive test was a first or second offense. He
tested positive for marijuana at the 1996 Olympics. But that was
before the substance was subject to Olympic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 12, Hall was informed that he had to serve 30 more
days of suspension or, through Dec. 12. He asked the Court Of
Arbitration in Sport at Lausanne to reconsider. He was told Monday
that his request had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just elated to be back in the pool,'' said Hall, who also
finished 11th in the 50 butterfly and is scheduled today to swim
the 50 freestyle as a prelude to the U.S. Open, Thursday through
Saturday. ``I didn't die and it didn't hurt. Making it to the
starting blocks was the real accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   FINA honorary secretary Gunnar Werner said from Sweden that Hall
still would be banned from competition abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is only valid in the United States,'' Werner
said. ``Hall is still suspended in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like
this. Our position is the court in the U.S. is not competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall went on to criticize FINA by comparing it treatment of him
to the way it has handled the Chinese, who have repeatedly tested
positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Marijuana is not
considered a performance enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuck it harder to me than they did the Chinese,'' Hall
said. ``It sends a confusing message.'' &QL;

MILLER MAY START AT MIDDLE LINEBACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; TEMPE, ARIZ. -  &UR; Jamir Miller is going to have to learn the
nuances of playing middle linebacker in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has been a starting outside linebacker during his
entire five years with the Cardinals, will work at middle
linebacker at today's practice because of knee injuries to starter
 &UR; Ronald
 &UR; McKinnon and backup  &UR; Mark Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jamir practices the way he's capable of practicing, we're
leaning on him starting him there,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said of
Sunday's game against the New York Giants. ``I think Jamir might be
really, really good there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Miller moving to the middle,  &UR; Patrick Sapp, 6 foot 4, 258
pounds, likely will make his first start at left outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to get the best football team out there,''
Tobin said. ``Patrick Sapp is getting better. I like the way he's
been practicing and I like his athletic ability. He has good size
and can match up on tight ends, and New York tight ends are very
good blockers and have given us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, who has started all 12 games this season, suffered a
sprained right knee in last Sunday's 34-24 loss at Kansas City. He
is the team's leading tackler with 112 and has a team-high five
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't expected to play against the Giants and is listed as
``week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll only be out one week and that's it,'' McKinnon
said. ``I can't miss games. But I also know I have to be smart
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said McKinnon could be out as long as two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox should be available after missing the past two weeks
because of a knee injury, but he might not be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks rest, I feel 100 times better,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, an eighth-year pro who signed as a free agent in the
off-season, hasn't started since last Nov. 30 when he played for
Buffalo against the New York Jets. &QL; 
Surgery scheduled &QL; 
Injured kicker  &UR; Joe Nedney feared the worst and wasn't
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic resonance imaging exam showed he suffered a rupture
of the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and will have
surgery when the swelling goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dr. Chick (team orthopedist  &UR; Russell Chick), and
he told me if I chose not to have surgery, I could kick without an
ACL, but I wouldn't be able to do anything else,'' Nedney said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery will take place in Vail, Colo., and will be
performed by Dr.  &UR; Richard Steadman, who also is scheduled to
perform arthroscopic surgery on Cardinals defensive tackle  &UR; Eric
Swann next week.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery for an ACL tear lasts nine to 12 months for most NFL
players, according to team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But Nedney is the first NFL kicker to suffer the injury to his
kicking leg. So, team officials are not sure how long he'll be out.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Jan. 1 comes, I want to be on the road to
recovery,'' Nedney said. ``I want to be ready for training camp (in
late July). I've had a few surgeries and healed much quicker than
expected.'' &QL;

SWANN DECIDES ON SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The Cardinals have given up hope that defensive
tackle Eric Swann will return this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said he expects Swann to have
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and miss the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Swann is scheduled to have the surgery Monday in Vail, Colo.,
where it will be performed by Richard Steadman, the orthopedist who
consults with the U.S. Olympic Ski Team.
</P>
<P>
   Steadman has recommended that Swann have his seventh
arthroscopic surgery, fifth on his arthritic right knee, and then
be on crutches for eight to nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials had hoped that Swann would seek another
opinion before having the surgery. Several of Swann's teammates
also have said they hoped he would postpone the surgery and return
to action to help the team in its playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   He had arthroscopic surgery on Oct. 28 and was expected to
return this week. But he complained of soreness in the knee and
informed Tobin that he planned to have another surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, who signed a five-year, $25 million contract in the
off-season, would end the season with 33 tackles, four sacks and
two forced fumbles in seven games. &QL;

   KINGS POINT, N.Y. _ Her mom was wearing the silver medal. Her
two younger sisters were doing their homework in the den. And Sarah
Hughes was bubbling about being back in school Tuesday after a
week's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see my friends,'' Sarah said. ``Everybody's
the same. I took a little detour, I went to Croatia, and nothing's
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One little thing has changed. Last Saturday in the city of
Zagreb, 13-year-old Sarah Hughes jumped and glided to a silver
medal in the world junior figure skating championships, putting
herself in a career glide path behind Americans like Kristi
Yamaguchi, Nancy Kerrigan, Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   To this bubbly girl with braces, Yamaguchi is an esteemed face
on a souvenir Wheaties box, perched in Sarah's bedroom. Kwan is
such an idol that Sarah lost the power of speech upon spotting her
in a restaurant, leaving Sarah's older sister, Rebecca, to do the
talking.
</P>
<P>
   For all her youthful reverence, Sarah Hughes is not a total
outsider, having won the national juniors last January.
</P>
<P>
   However, she is triple-lutzing her way toward the top in a
highly unusual manner _ living at home, with her parents, her two
brothers, her three sisters and the family collie.
</P>
<P>
   She is a homebody. Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   For some female prodigies, the family becomes stifling, even
dangerous, as it did for Pierce and Lucic families in tennis and
the Moceanu family in gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   At Sarah's age, junior tennis players learn their trade in
so-called academies, gymnasts cast their fate with driven coaches
who take over the father role, and figure skaters move across the
globe to work with a celebrity coach or dominant national center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the banquet in Zagreb and Sarah noticed that none
of the Russian skaters had a parent with her,'' said John Hughes,
the father.
</P>
<P>
   John and Amy Hughes are dedicated to staying close to Sarah, now
a distinct contender for a medal at the nationals in Salt Lake City
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah still returns to her home and the family collie and a
stash of Beanie Babies thrown to the ice by fans.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Sarah took out her violin and was so dissatisfied by
the rust that she had to run through it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the way Sarah is,'' said her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Sarah even played in the orchestra at Great Neck
North Middle School, but she had to make a concession to her
skating routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah says she prefers to ``work the smartest, not the
hardest,'' and is confident she can pursue an Olympic gold medal
with Robin Wagner, who coaches her at Iceland in nearby New Hyde
Park, not a full practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin is really great,'' Sarah said Tuesday. ``She keeps
preparing me for things. But it's really up to me. I have to push
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who competed on a national level, was a choreographer
for four years while Sarah worked with Patti Johnson. ``You don't
have to pull a child from the family,'' Wagner said. ``The
socialization is very important to Sarah.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah also travels to Newark, Del., to work with Jeff
DiGregorio, who once coached Tara Lipinski. Sarah gave credit to
DiGregorio for putting in the triple lutz that helped her win the
national juniors in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would like to see her more,'' DiGregorio said
yesterday, ``but it's been hard for her to get down here. She is a
natural, very catlike, with a great sense of where she is in the
air. But I would not encourage her to leave her family because she
needs the normal chaos, and I mean that in a positive sense, of
being around her family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a vibrant and talented family. John Hughes, a prominent
tax lawyer, was the all-American captain of the undefeated Cornell
hockey team in 1969-70 and was the last cut of the Toronto Maple
Leafs (in favor of Darryl Sittler, he notes). Amy Hughes, a Cornell
graduate and certified public accountant, is now recovering after a
grueling series of treatments for breast cancer a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The parents understand that the children will leave the nest.
Rebecca, 21, is a senior at Harvard and editor of the weekly
Independent. David, 17, is spending the winter in Chicago, playing
for a Junior A hockey team. The other three are home. Matthew, age
15, plays hockey in high school. Emily, 9, is also a promising
figure skater. And Taylor, 7, is still exploring her skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, Sarah is just one of six,'' the father said. ``She
has to fight with everybody else for her TV shows. I wouldn't want
her going away and just hanging around a rink when she wasn't
skating. She'll do fine with her skating. It's after her skating
that I'm thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Success in the juniors does not automatically mean a road to a
medal. Yamaguchi was the last former American junior champion to
win an Olympic gold medal, back in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important championship,'' Sarah said Tuesday.
``But you don't know what will happen later. This doesn't mean I'm
definitely going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now she has her family and her friends _ and her homework.
Her social studies teacher told her to prepare a report on Croatia,
turning her silver-medal journey into a school field trip. Sarah
Hughes is determined to make it work both ways.

SO WHO'S GOING TO HIT FOR THIS TEAM

<P>
   PHOENIX - OK, so now the Diamondbacks are armed with the
second-best rotation in the National League. If all goes according
to plan, the club's starting pitchers will be the foundation for
what could be the most startling turnaround from 1998 to '99.
</P>
<P>
   With the rotation apparently set for years to come, the club's
primary concern will be getting the offense to somehow measure up
to the pitching.
</P>
<P>
   With six bona fide starters on the roster, it seems all but
certain that Brian Anderson will be the odd-man out. His trade
value is fairly high and the front office hopes to get a
run-producing outfielder in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Until such a deal can be worked out, let's assume the roster
will stay intact. If they had to play a game today the lineup would
look something like this: Andy Fox, RF; Jay Bell, 2B; Travis Lee,
1B; Matt Williams, 3B; Bernard Gilkey, LF; Tony Batista, SS; Kelly
Stinnett, C and Dante Powell, CF.
</P>
<P>
   True, it looks strikingly similar to the one from last season,
the one that managed to score a paltry 665 runs, just 21 more than
Montreal's NL-worst total. As with any December analysis, there are
intangibles the club hopes will work in its favor in 1999. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a jack-of-all trades, would start in right field and lead
off, which would alleviate pressure on Powell to try to break into
the majors and lead off. Bell needs to cut down on his strikeouts
and improve his on-base percentage. But the club would gladly take
another 20 home runs and 70 or so RBIs from him.
</P>
<P>
   Lee looks as if he just needs to be left alone to continue his
maturation into a big-league star. Is Batista for real? Well,
there's really only one way to find out, and that's to stick him
out there every day. Stinnett will combine with Damian Miller
behind the plate and although their offense is nothing out of this
world, the club would like for the pair to concentrate on their
catching duties.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two biggest question marks looming over the offense
are the projected No. 4 and 5 hitters, where the big RBI men
usually stand tall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Williams nor Gilkey, who figure to hold down those two
spots, had a season worth remembering in 1998. However, each can
point to previous years and be confident of turning one horrible
season into little more than a bad memory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has clubbed 299 home runs in his career, slumped
to his second least-productive season (20 home runs and 71 RBIs) of
his career. As recent as 1997 Williams hit 32 home runs with 105
RBIs for Cleveland. This is not a guy who is over the hill, no
matter how much hair he's lost.
</P>
<P>
   The club's primary reason to believe Williams will bounce back
and return to his usual 30 home runs and 100 RBIs hinges on
Williams' intense pride. This is a player who was seemingly never
content with his results during his All-Star seasons, so you can
imagine how disappointed the four-time Gold Glove winner was after
last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand there's Gilkey, who went from being an
undrafted high school kid almost to All-Star caliber. Gilkey
pounded out 275 extra-base hits from 1993-97, including slugging at
least 40 doubles in a season twice.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilkey managed just one extra-base hit in 101 at-bats after
arriving in a July 31 trade from the New York Mets, which is one
more than managing general partner Jerry Colangelo had last season
_ and he never stepped into the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking, even back to his days with the Mets, was that
Gilkey's eyesight was below par. After the Mets were unsuccessful
in prodding Gilkey into considering laser eye surgery, the
Diamondbacks were able to do so in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey has reported to management that his eyesight has not been
this sharp in years.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks only hope he can become a force. Gilkey does
not have to put up a season like 1996, when he hit .317 with 30
home runs and 117 RBIs. Anything near 20 home runs and 80 RBIs will
be more than enough to bulk up the middle of what was one of the
weakest lineups in baseball last season.
</P>
<P>
   One other thought, with this starting rotation in place the
Diamondbacks' hitters know they do not need to score five or six
runs to win. Just getting these type starters, any kind of early
run support should be more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre, Andy Benes, Omar Daal and
Armando Reynoso just ask for a couple of early runs. Then they will
do the rest. Still, the onus will be on the offense to take care of
its end of the bargain. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon, the United States' largest oil company, formally agreed
on Tuesday to buy Mobil, the next-largest, for $80 billion in
stock, to form the world's biggest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   While the merger is not likely to have any immediate effect on
prices at the pump, antitrust regulators will certainly scrutinize
it and probably force the sale of some gas stations and refineries.
</P>
<P>
   So great are the doubts that the companies will win approval or
accept the required divestitures that investors sent the stock
prices of both companies down on Tuesday. Shares of Exxon dropped
$3.375, to $71.625, and Mobil fell $2.25, to $83.75, well below
Exxon's offer price of $99.01 a share, based on Monday's closing
Exxon stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would reunite the two largest pieces of John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up in 1911 in
the nation's most celebrated antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The companies contended Tuesday that they now confront global
competitors and plunging energy prices, making their recombination
and the resulting savings a necessity. But while the companies said
they could save $2.8 billion annually, the greatest costs would be
paid by employees. The companies said 9,000 workers out of 123,000
worldwide were likely to find themselves without jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, who
would add the title of president in the combined company, said
repeatedly that further efficiency, not brute size, was his goal.
``This is the case of the whole being greater than the sum of the
parts,'' he said at a news conference, later adding: ``I have
always had the view that the objective is to be best. If in being
best you also have to be biggest, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil, as the company would be called, would have sales of
$204 billion, surpassing General Motors as the world's largest
company and Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the largest oil company. It
would still appear to motorists as the familiar separate
operations, with gas stations and oil cans bearing the distinct
brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Federal Trade Commission, saying they were
first told of the agreement Tuesday, had no comment. Antitrust
experts said the regulators were likely to review the effects city
by city and region by region, probably requiring the sale of at
least some gas stations and refineries. ``If large divestitures are
required, it could be that the deal doesn't make sense,'' said
Eleanor Fox, who teaches antitrust law at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry analysts agreed with Raymond and Lucio Noto,
Mobil's chief executive, who would be the combined company's vice
chairman, that the corporations and their shareholders would do
better united.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal comes as mergers are also welding together
many of the world's largest banks, automakers and telephone
companies. The companies said that they would have about a 13
percent share of the gasoline market in the United States, compared
with about 14 percent for the partnership between Shell and Texaco
and 10.5 percent for British Petroleum should it complete its
planned $48.2 billion purchase of Amoco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the latest combination, saying that other
industry mergers would follow. ``To create lower costs and greater
efficiencies, they had to go outside their own organizations,''
said Frederick Leuffer of Bear, Stearns. ``That same question is
now before the other major oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts said they considered Mobil's $80 billion
price tag to be fairly high, but reasonable considering the
benefits. Raymond said the purchase would have no effect on his
company's profitability in the first year and would begin adding to
earnings per share after that.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon would trade 1.32 shares for each Mobil share, leaving
Exxon shareholders owning 70 percent of the resulting company. The
company would be based at Exxon's current headquarters in Irving,
Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Mobil's headquarters in Fairfax, Va.,
would become the center for refining and sales, while Houston would
be home to exploration, production and chemicals.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The contrasting strengths and styles of the companies and their
chief executives were on display Tuesday at their meetings on Wall
Street with analysts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering from South
Dakota, brought a reputation as a blunt cost-cutter and technician.
Pruning his work force year by year, he has already made his
company a model of efficiency. His shareholder returns at Exxon
usually match the broad market indexes whose advances have been
paced by companies making computer software or chips.
</P>
<P>
   Noto, whose company has slimmed down, too, is better known as a
salesman and international diplomat. While Exxon is cautious about
developing new oil and natural-gas sources abroad, Mobil has
operations ranging from Indonesia to the Persian Gulf and the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when chief executives carefully tend their images,
Raymond remains unfriendly to the media, refusing to become a
celebrity and deflecting questions he deems redundant or dumb.
``I'm not interested in your views of how we ought to deal with the
FTC,'' he told a reporter on Tuesday who asked why his company had
not begun by telling the agency what operations it would sell.
</P>
<P>
   So if Raymond took the lead in reciting the merger's
particulars, it fell to Noto to set forth the imperatives in more
human terms. ``This is not a combination based on desperation,'' he
said. ``It is one based on opportunity. But we need to face some
facts. The world has changed. The easy things are behind us. The
easy oil, the easy cost savings, they're done. So all of us are now
looking for some way to make a jump, to make a quantum leap, to be
able to deliver more value to our shareholders, and our employees
and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto was likewise the one who explained that while managers
couldn't offer more details of the likely job cuts, ``They are not
cold and indifferent. They understand that jobs are important and
they understand the impact on communities.'' About 40 percent, or
50,000, of the companies' employees are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The executives bemoaned oil prices that are low and getting
lower, since the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries finished
their recent meeting without doing much more than agreeing to meet
again. But they said their agreement was based far more on their
views of where their competitors and their industry were going over
the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   In a consolidating industry, they said, they see powerful
national oil companies expanding to other countries. They spoke of
the need for huge amounts of capital and deep technological
expertise to produce oil and natural gas from beneath arctic ice
and unexplored seas.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's restiveness in public and Exxon's history of dealing
with the media may hamper efforts to sell the agreement to the
public. Exxon's handling of the 1989 grounding of its Exxon Valdez
tanker off Alaska has come to be known as one of the industry's
worst environmental and public relations disasters. Parting company
with European competitors like British Petroleum and Royal
Dutch/Shell, Exxon and Mobil are opposing a treaty meant to slow
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Since news of the talks broke last Wednesday, antitrust experts
and consumer advocates have been picking it apart. ``Rockefeller's
revenge'' is how the merger was described by Andrew Heaney,
president of Heat USA, a fuel-oil buying cooperative in Long
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's little question in my mind that if you have
industry consolidation on this magnitude, you're going to see
energy prices controlled by fewer people.''
</P>
<P>
   At gasoline stations, consumers had mixed views. Some, like
Juanita Purner of Santa Monica, Calif., suspect that the deal will
raise prices. ``To me, that says monopoly, big business, more
control, she said at a Mobil station in Los Angeles. ``I may have
to take the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Wayne Daniels of Farmingville, N.Y., seemed
more concerned about the workers. ``I've heard that thousands of
jobs will be lost in the merger,'' he said at a Mobil station in
Riverhead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has been far more ardent in seeking partners, allies and
acquisitions, combining its European refineries and gas stations
with British Petroleum's. Exxon has stood aloof, assuming it was
large enough to fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond said in a brief interview Tuesday that he had been
pondering how much more profitable his company could become in
league with Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation began after an American Petroleum Institute
Committee meeting last June, when their ostensible subject was a
possible alliance in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should talk about that,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That and other things,'' Noto responded. About three weeks
later, they began merger talks in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been briefed on their discussions said that
agreements on price came easily and early. Sorting through the
potential antitrust obstacles and deciding who should get what job
took longer. The boards held their own separate discussions as
well, especially on the antitrust questions.

SOME EUROPEAN MERGERS ARE MADE IN WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France _ The idea behind any merger is that bigger
is better. But the wave of giant mergers in Europe this week
reflects something else as well: weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Europe's mightiest enterprises face serious competitive
weaknesses. Germany's biggest banks have lost ground in their own
market to Wall Street investment banks, while intense competition
has squeezed profits out of commercial lending.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-bottom oil prices have sent the world's biggest
petrochemical companies flying into each other's arms. And in the
pharmaceutical industry, plans by Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA
to merge their drug and agricultural-chemical businesses mark a
union between two companies with an abundance of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that neither Rhone Poulenc nor Hoechst compare well
yet in terms of operating profits,'' admitted Jean-Rene Fourtou,
the chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, just before the companies announced
their plans here.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked why neither company had sought a stronger
American partner, company officials suggested they did not have
much choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which American companies?'' asked Jurgen Dormann, the chairman
of Hoechst, based in Frankfurt, Germany. ``Merck? Monsanto? Would
they have been interested?''
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts argue that broader pressures are behind
Europe's urge to merge. Inflation has sunk so low here that few
companies have any room to raise prices and some are being forced
to slash them. That has made it harder to deliver the kinds of
growth in nominal profits that entice shareholders. The launch of
the euro as a single currency for 11 countries in January adds to
the competition and price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies basically on the defensive,'' said Bryan
Allworthy, a European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch. ``They
have no pricing power. They are seeing challenges to their market
shares or their business lines. They know they have to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But in their race to do something, corporate executives are
running into a growing wall of skepticism from investors.
Rhone-Poulenc's stock dropped 6 percent in early trading Tuesday,
even though the elements of Tuesday's deal had been well known for
more than a week. Deutsche Bank's stock has declined amid a torrent
of criticism from analysts about its $10.1 billion takeover of
Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And when news surfaced Tuesday that Total, the French oil
company, was about to take over Petrofina of Belgium, its stock
plunged nearly 10 percent in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has never seen so many billion-dollar mergers in one
year, and nowhere near so many big deals announced in just one
week. Viag AG, the industrial conglomerate based in Munich,
Germany, reached an agreement to merge with the Swiss packaging
company Algroup.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, announced its $10.1
agreement on Monday to buy Bankers Trust. Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc
will pool their drug and agricultural-science businesses to create
a new company with $20 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in both the oil and the chemical industries predict
more big deals in the months ahead, as both industries struggle
with slumping demand and falling prices.

ON ICE OR BENCH, FETISOV STILL STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slava Fetisov, the heralded captain of Russia's national hockey
team in the 1980s, was the pioneer in paving the way for Russian
hockey players to come to the National Hockey League. Now, Fetisov
could be on his way to becoming the league's first Russian head
coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fetisov, who is 40, joined the New Jersey Devils in 1989 after a
persistent battle with Russian authorities for the freedom to play
in North America. He was traded to Detroit during the 1994-95
season, the Devils' Stanley Cup campaign. But he won the cup twice
with the Red Wings before the Devils elevated Robbie Ftorek to head
coach last summer and named Fetisov an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even after almost 10 years away from his homeland, Fetisov is
still considered Russia's richest hockey resource, a reflection not
only of his athletic value but of his character. Although he could
have defected several times, Fetisov patiently went through
authorized channels before leaving Russia for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Russia told me this was a small position for me,''
Fetisov said of his new job after a recent practice with the
Devils. ``They said I should go to Russia and be a minister of
sport, but this is what I want to do. I'm learning the business
side of hockey, and I'm learning how to coach in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetisov is the second Russian to be an assistant in the NHL, and
the only one currently; the first was Vasily Tikonov, with San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a great experience for me to see hockey from the
players' side for so long and now coaching,'' Fetisov said. ``I
didn't expect to be in such a position already.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Fetisov has been with the Devils for only three months,
he has already been largely responsible for the Devils' transition
from Jacques Lemaire's defense-oriented style to a bigger emphasis
on offense. Ftorek and Fetisov have been on the same wavelength
about the change in style, and Ftorek has adopted a number of
Fetisov's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the greatest players to play the game, and now
he's jumping into coaching with the same diligence,'' Ftorek said.
``I give him quite a bit of responsibility before periods and games
to talk to the players. We talk a lot about players and systems. He
does game tapes and isolations. He's learning fast.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fetisov does best is work on the ice with the Devils'
defensemen. He spends extra time after practices with the team's
younger defensemen, like Scott Niedermayer, Sheldon Souray and Brad
Bombardir, teaching them body technique and how to play certain
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does what the players need the most,'' Ftorek said. ``He
does on-the-spot tutelage. In games, he would see something and
compute it immediately. The bench is the best place to teach
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetisov said: ``One of the biggest things in hockey is to make
sure you know what is going on with all the players. They're like
family. The coaches are here to make the players better. Some guys
have questions all the time, and that's what makes the job
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, says the team's strong start
this season is because of the open communication between the
players and the coaches. ``Robbie and Slava are great when it comes
to that,'' Stevens said. ``When it comes to Slava, there's nothing
phony about him. He knows when there's time for fun and time to be
serious. He speaks from the heart and cares about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer may be benefiting most from Fetisov's presence. At
the suggestion of Fetisov, the speedy Niedermayer is starting to
use his offensive skills more. ``He trusts my judgment when to get
into the offensive zone, and he encourages me to do it,''
Niedermayer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello has a history of picking
the right men to coach his players. It was Lamoriello who chose Jim
Schoenfeld, and he brought the Devils to their first playoff berth
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello also brought in Ftorek, who was responsible for
developing a trove of great young players in the minor leagues
before his promotion to head coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamoriello's most inspired coup was getting Jacques Lemaire,
who coached the Devils for five years and brought them the Stanley
Cup in 1995. Lamoriello found a way to persuade Lemaire to leave
Montreal for New Jersey, just as he later persuaded Fetisov to opt
for New Jersey instead of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I look at is the kind of individual I'm
dealing with, and what he can bring to the team,'' Lamoriello said.
``It is what he can bring to the team as an individual and add
collectively to the team's overall philosophy. In the case of
Slava, I consulted with Robbie a great deal before we made the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said his decision to hire Fetisov was influenced by
the fact that Fetisov played for five years with the Devils before
winning two Stanley Cups with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slava contributes to the team individually and collectively,''
Lamoriello said. ``He's been a winner at every level and has
respect from everybody. He's an intelligent man who adjusts to
situations. But his biggest asset is that he cares for people. He

JUNIOR GOTTI SAYS HE'S BROKE, WANTS BAIL EASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claiming that bail expenses and the federal government's seizure
of his assets have impoverished him, John A. Gotti, the reputed mob
boss, said Tuesday that he was no longer able to pay the grocery,
household and medical bills for his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's biggest headache, his lawyers said, is a mandatory
payment of $21,000 a month for private guards that monitor his
activities at his main house in Oyster Bay on Long Island. Guards
were required as part of Gotti's $10 million bail package approved
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, known as Junior, is awaiting trial on federal
racketeering charges; prosecutors accuse him of being the acting
boss of the Gambino crime family on behalf of his imprisoned
father, John J. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Pleading proverty for the younger Gotti, his lawyers said that
his income was just $11,000 a month, mainly from auto parts and
vending machine companies that he partly owns and that have not
been placed in escrow by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the guards' expenses and the freezing of his assets,
the lawyers said Gotti was unable to meet his basic monthly
overhead, including $11,000 for mortgage payments on homes in
Oyster Bay and Massapequa, N.Y., and property in the Pocono
Mountains in Pennsylvania; $1,600 for groceries to feed his family,
and $1,100 for utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of Gotti's economic plight were disclosed in a
letter by one of his lawyers, Gerald Shargel, to Judge Barrington
Parker Jr. of U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y. Gotti is
applying to ease his bail conditions while he awaits trial and to
regain assets that prosecutors assert were obtained through
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, Sarita Kedia, said Gotti might
voluntarily go back to jail unless the security company payments
were eliminated. ``He's broke,'' Ms. Kedia said in an interview.
``He may be forced to get a court-assigned counsel because he does
not have the ability to continue to pay his legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's assets include $458,000 in cash and in bank accounts,
his six-bedroom home in Oyster Bay, another home in Massapequa,
commercial buildings in Queens and the Poconos properties. All are
subject to confiscation he is convicted at a trial set to begin in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 34, had assets of more than $3 million, according to
court records, when he was indicted in January on a raft of
charges, including being the head of a Gambino crime family unit
that extorted $1 million from the Scores topless club in Manhattan,
engaged in labor racketeering shakedowns, engineered fraudulent
sales of prepaid telephone cards and ran illegal gambling and
loan-sharking rings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have opposed the application to discontinue
surveillance by private guards and to free Gotti's assets on the
grounds that he could intimidate prosecution witnesses and that he
and his co-defendants obtained $20 million in illegal profits from
their alleged racketeering schemes.

THIRD QUARTER GOLDEN FOR OROAMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The third quarter proved to be a golden period for
jewelry maker OroAmerica Inc., which experienced a healthy spike in
operating income despite overall lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Tuesday, the company's sales for
the period ended Oct. 30 jumped 18 percent compared with the
comparable year-ago period to $54.6 million from $46.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although overall net income dipped 17 percent to $2.9 million
(or 46 cents per diluted share) from $3.5 million (56 cents),
operating income for the quarter actually increased 136 percent
when a one-time $4.7 million gain posted in the comparable year-ago
period is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   According to company officials, operating income this quarter
was $5.2 million compared with last year's $6.9million. Without
that pretax gain from the settlement of litigation, however, last
year's operating income would have been $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, net income without the settlement would have
plunged to $933,000, or 15 cents per diluted share, in last year's
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Which all means that the company is operating more profitably
this time around, said Shiu Shao, the company's chief operating and
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gross profit margin improved significantly,'' he said,
adding it was 25 percent this quarter versus last year's 22.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent OroAmerica stock up $1.25 Tuesday to close at
$10.25 _ its highest showing since Aug. 24, when it ended the day
at the same price.

 &HT;    Ricky Williams offensive player of the year in All-Big 12 Team
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While Kansas State's bid for a national football
championship has been conducted in relative _ and frequently
self-imposed _ anonymity, the University of Texas' revival has been
the Big 12's feel-good story of the year, at least for those of a
burnt-orange persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighted by Ricky Williams, who has run into the record books
and is in line to win the school's second Heisman Trophy, several
of the key components of the Longhorns' fairy-tale season have been
rewarded with major awards on the Austin American-Statesman's 1998
All-Big 12 Team.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, major-college football's all-time rushing leader, is
the offensive player of the year. While Kansas State quarterback
Michael Bishop had a marvelous season and earned first-team honors,
Williams had a season for the ages that capped a career for the
ages. He rushed for a national-best 2,124 yards this year, giving
him 6,279 for his career to eclipse Tony Dorsett's 22-year-old
national record. Williams has broken 12 NCAA records and tied four
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got my vote for the Heisman, if I had one,'' said Texas
A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, the American-Statesman's defensive
player of the year. ``I don't think I'll ever play against anyone
as good as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   For having the good sense to let Ricky run, and for
orchestrating a four-game turnaround from last season and
re-igniting the enthusiasm for UT football that had been waning in
its disenfranchised fans, Mack Brown is the coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been the most fun I've ever had in
coaching,'' Brown said after guiding the Longhorns to an 8-3 mark.
``I don't think I've ever seen a team improve this much, especially
with their self-image and their attitude and just having fun. It's
been a great year and it's been fun to see the way the fans have
responded to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-year UT coach edged Kansas State's Bill Snyder for the
honor. Snyder's Wildcats have done a marvelous job in positioning
themselves for a shot at a national championship, but that was
pretty much expected of them this season. And their title dreams
have been hurt because of Snyder's decision to play a weak
nonconference schedule, which has dropped them to third in the Bowl
Championship Series computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' resurgence was due in no small part to the
transformation of their defense from a league laughingstock last
year to a respected unit this season. For that reason, UT defensive
coordinator Carl Reese is the assistant coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With basically the same players who allowed 399.2 yards per game
last season to rank 10th in the Big 12 and 85th nationally, Reese
molded the Longhorns into a more aggressive, attack-oriented unit.
Texas' rush defense improved dramatically _ a must in the
tailback-rich Big 12 _ as the Horns allowed only 143.5 ground yards
per game after being at 241.5 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve it,'' Reese said of the honor. ``I've got a
lot of great assistants.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, despite being undersized, used his amazing football
instincts to become the all-time career tackling leader for the
Aggies. With 14 tackles in the regular-season finale against Texas,
Nguyen has a league-high 130 stops for the season and 500 for his
career.

 &HT;    Cities balking at proposed boost in police, firefighter pensions
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Police are sometimes called the thin blue
line, but Florida cities say their budgets will bleed a thin red
line if GOP legislators start 1999 by forcing them to boost
pensions for police and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will cost cities up to $55 million annually, including
$760,000 in Delray Beach, $1.9 million in Boca Raton, and $83,000
in Riviera Beach, according to a Price Waterhouse study
commissioned by the Florida League of Cities. The cities spent
$50,000 for the study. Its conclusions were immediately questioned
by unions and Republican leaders, who stand in rare alliance on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by the taxpayer group Florida TaxWatch, the cities called
the plan obvious payback for Republican political endorsements by
police and fire unions. Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed the
bill last year, saying it wasn't right for Tallahassee to be
dictating to cities that they had to use certain tax revenues for
pension benefits that were not necessarily part of contracts they
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Delray city commissioners Tuesday night approved a resolution
supporting the veto. Mayor Jay Alperin said he talked with some
state representatives about the issue and they were ``very
resistant and reluctant. The power of the interests who are
promoting this is really overwhelming.'' But Boca Raton finance
director Meryvn Timberlake said he was not sure the city's costs
would be as high as $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker John Thrasher has said he wants to override the
veto as the first thing his chamber does, possibly in a special
session in January. ``It was clearly a political deal,'' said Scott
Maddox, mayor of Tallahassee and vice president of the Florida
League of Cities whose own father was a cop involved in politics.
``Clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a second study by Tallahassee researcher Lance
deHaven-Smith showing Florida's pension benefits are already among
the most generous in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   David Murrell, executive director of the Florida Police
Benevolent Association, was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go out and pay somebody $50,000 to say what we want
and it would have the same amount of credibility,'' Murrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher said no one outside the cities' payroll has verified
the report's claims. He said he had not changed his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to move ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Jeb Bush has indicated support for the bill, which he
confirmed again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Toni Jennings, through a spokeswoman, said she
may be content to wait until the regular session to take up the
issue. There was only one ``no'' vote for the bill in the Senate
last year, but it came from Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Palm Harbor, who
is now majority leader and a Jennings ally.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first salvo in a renewed campaign to beat a
bill that passed the legislature with overwhelming support last
year, though the pension battle has raged for years. Maddox said it
passed because legislators were told it wouldn't really cost
anything _ that only new taxes from insurance policies would be
used to standardize minimum pension amounts statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have four people in my family in that profession, and if I
were told it wouldn't cost anything I probably would have said sure
I'd vote for it,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that cities are depending on the tax
money in question _ which comes from growth in tax revenues from
home and car insurance policies _ to pay for growing needs in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers, city officials charge, are traitors to their own
party's principles of smaller government and lower taxes; it's a
classic case of passing a law and providing no money for it.
</P>
<P>
   QuickReadGOP leaders say the cost of boosting fire and police
pensions would be minimal, but cities commissioned a study that
found it would be a half-billion dollars over 10 years. Estimated
increased annual costs:
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach $83,000
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach $760,000
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton $1.9 million
</P>
<P>
   Orlando $5.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lauderdale $3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Statewide $55.7 million

 &HT;    Mother held after trying to drown her children
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A suburban Boca Raton mother who faces
attempted murder charges after locking her two children in her car
and driving into a canal east of Boca Rio Road, was ordered held in
jail without bond Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Oviedo, 27, and her two children _ Maria, 7, and Michael,
3 _ were pulled to safety Monday night by her husband and Shimshon
Hazan, a motorist who stopped to help.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo had been living with relatives, police reports show. She
was temporarily separated from her husband, Miguel, 28. On Monday,
she got into a fight with her mother, telling her, ``Tomorrow you
are going to bury three, because you will not see the kids again,''
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she called her cousin, Leidy Manzo, and asked Manzo to tell
Miguel Oviedo to meet her by the canal. When he and Manzo arrived
around 10 p.m., Ingrid had locked herself and the children inside
the car, reports said. ``I have had it. I have no privacy. Everyone
meddles in my life,'' she told Manzo, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children (were) begging her to open the door'' of the 1995
Toyota 4Runner, the police report said, but ``Ingrid would not let
them. She told them, `No,' and to sit down.'' Then she drove the
car into the 15-foot-deep canal, sheriff's department spokesman
Paul Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, the husband was able to get a tire iron,'' Miller
said. ``He broke out the back window and pulled the two kids out of
the car.'' Miguel Oviedo told police that his wife helped him get
one of their children out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Hazan was on his way home when he noticed several cars parked by
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk up and the car is almost under water,'' said Hazan, of
suburban Boca Raton. ``So I don't even think. I take off my shoes
and just jump in the water.'' Only about a foot of the car remained
above water, Hazan said, as he and Miguel Oviedo dragged a
semi-conscious Ingrid out of the car. ``I'm standing on top of the
car and it's sinking fast. If it goes under, she dies. It was pitch
black; there was no way we could save her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I'm thinking about my family, and also the
other car they just pulled from the canal,'' Hazan said. In
February 1997, the remains of five teenagers who had been missing
since July 14, 1979, were found in a van at the bottom of the same
canal, just north of Glades Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so sorry for (the Oviedo) kids,'' Hazan said. ``Imagine
what this does to them emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria and Michael Oviedo were treated on the canal bank for
minor scrapes and bruises. They went home with their father, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Oviedo, who does not speak English, was taken to West
Boca Medical Center, where she was interviewed by a detective and
charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of
aggravated child assault.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Oviedo was at his wife's court appearance Tuesday
afternoon, Miller said, and the two waved to each other toward the
end of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the door at the Oviedo home refused to
comment.

METS GET BENITEZ, HUNDLEY GOES TO THE DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armando Benitez gained notoriety in New York last
summer by instigating a major brawl with the Yankees. But the
hard-throwing reliever will have a chance to change his image with
the Mets, who acquired Benitez Tuesday in a three-team swap that
sent catcher Todd Hundley to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets traded Hundley and a minor league pitcher to the
Dodgers for catcher Charles Johnson and outfielder Roger Cedeno.
The Mets, who had no spot for Hundley after signing Mike Piazza to
a huge, long-term deal in October, then dealt Johnson to the
Orioles for Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Orioles, who seem to be engaged in a parallel
existence these days, are also going head to head in the bidding
for free agents Robin Ventura and B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had the larger offer for Ventura as of late Tuesday
afternoon, a four-year, $32 million deal _ exactly what the third
baseman had asked for at the outset of negotiations, and $2 million
more than the $30 million deal dangled by the Orioles. However,
Baltimore may redouble its efforts to sign Ventura now that first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro has left the Orioles to sign a five-year,
$45 million contract with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, an outfielder, met Tuesday with Mets general manager
Steve Phillips; Phillips said afterward that the Mets must
determine whether they should increase their three-year, $13.5
million offer to Surhoff, who has a three-year, $14.5 million offer
in hand from the Orioles, as well as a four-year, $17 million deal
forwarded by the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual three-team deal Tuesday was a natural because of the
needs of the respective teams. The Mets, needing bullpen help, have
tried prying Benitez from the Orioles for the last two months.
Baltimore has sought a front-line catcher, but shied away from
Hundley because of concern about his surgically-repaired right
elbow, a worry that only grew more acute after the Mets refused the
Orioles' request to examine Hundley. The Dodgers made no secret of
their distaste for Johnson, who struggled in his four-month trial
with Los Angeles last summer, and their desire to acquire Hundley,
who hit 71 homers combined during the 1996 and 1997 seasons before
his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, 26, one of the game's hardest throwers, started a May
19 fight with the Yankees by hitting Tino Martinez in the back with
a 98-mph fastball, earning a thuggish reputation in New York. But
Benitez can also dominate a game. He has 283 strikeouts in 2132/3
innings over five seasons in the majors; opponents batted just .199
against him last season.
</P>
<P>
   With Benitez, the Mets' bullpen could be among the strongest in
the majors, including current closer John Franco, left-hander
Dennis Cook, and Turk Wendell, a right-hander who compiled a 2.06
ERA after the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez tore an elbow ligament in 1996 after toying with a
split-finger fastball, and there was fear that he would need
reconstructive elbow surgery that summer. But Benitez bounced back
and, according to Baltimore officials, he has not had any
subsequent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley played the last nine seasons with the Mets, and had been
considered a team leader in the team's recent bleak years. He
evolved into big-time slugger in 1996, hitting 41 home runs and
driving in 112 runs, and the Mets rewarded him with a four-year,
$20 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries chipped away at Hundley in 1997. He hit 30 home
runs, but pain in his elbow forced him to the bench before the
All-Star break, and subsequent examination revealed that he would
ultimately need reconstructive surgery. Hundley played on, as the
Mets pushed for a playoff berth, until finally breaking down in
September and undergoing surgery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hundley's relationship with the team had deteriorated during the
past two seasons, in spite of his popularity with his teammates. In
August 1997, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine suggested to reporters
that Hundley did not sleep enough. And when asked if he had spoken
to Hundley about his drinking or smoking, Valentine said that he
might have; Hundley responded angrily for several days, before
going to Valentine and smoothing their differences.
</P>
<P>
   As Hundley recovered from his surgery _ and the Mets fretted
about whether he would be able to come back _ Phillips told Hundley
that he would not acquire Mike Piazza. The Mets then traded for
Piazza within the week.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley reacted with disgust, and in the days that followed word
leaked from within the Mets' organization that team officials were
concerned that Hundley was drinking too much. Hundley was furious
about what he considered to be a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed to try the outfield, an experiment that failed
miserably. Hundley batted .161 with 3 home runs in 53 games for the
Mets, his defense was horrible, and he went to Valentine to remove
himself from the lineup. After the Mets signed Piazza to a
seven-year, $91 million contract on Oct. 26, Phillips promised to
trade Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, 24, is a center fielder who has not blossomed the way
the Dodgers had expected. He batted .242 in 105 games for the
Dodgers last season, but it is unlikely the Mets will view him as
answer to their need for a leadoff hitter _ Cedeno had a .317
on-base percentage last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also included Arnold Gooch in the trade with the
Dodgers. Gooch has been among the Mets' better prospects. At age
22, he already has two years of experience in Class AA, compiling
21 victories over the last two seasons. However, Gooch's stuff is
not regarded as overpowering; rather, he relies on his control.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 27, batted .218 for the Florida Marlins and the Los
Angeles Dodgers last season. He gives the Orioles the strong
defensive catcher they have not had for years, but many baseball
executives believe his offensive skills have regressed.

USC PLAYERS NOT THRILLED WITH SUN BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC was selected to play in the Sun Bowl on
Tuesday, and despite having missed out on postseason play for two
years, the news brought almost unanimous frowns from the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The game will probably be a rematch of USC's season opener, with
Purdue likely headed to El Paso for the New Year's Eve contest.
</P>
<P>
   USC's players had hoped for a trip to San Diego, but the Holiday
Bowl selected Oregon over the Trojans on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some bad stuff about it because it's in El Paso,''
quarterback Carson Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of playing the Boilermakers was nearly as unpopular
with the players as their destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already played that team. It's silly,'' linebacker Chris
Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (8-4) will be USC's opponent, unless Ohio State is
selected for a BCS bowl game. The Buckeyes are not expected to be
an at-large team in the BCS bowls, however, leaving the
Boilermakers as the near-certain choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the slim event Purdue must head elsewhere, the Sun Bowl is
talking to Texas Tech, Mississippi and Texas Christian as backup
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fortunate to go to a bowl game, you just hope you don't
have to go play the same team,'' defensive end Lawrence Larry said.
``Who wants to watch that game on TV? I would think that the
organizers would try to get another team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl seemed considerably happier about having the
Trojans (8-4) than the players, although as recently as Sunday, it
had hoped to avoid a USC-Purdue rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our eyes on USC from the beginning,'' said John Folmer,
executive director of the Sun Bowl. ``They draw so well for us.
They have a strong local following. This is a border community and
they like USC. They will also do a lot for us on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   USC played Michigan State in the 1990 Sun Bowl, then known as
the John Hancock Bowl. The game drew a near-capacity crowd of
50,562, and the Trojans lost 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Sun Bowl was USC coach Paul Hackett's first game
as head coach. He was named interim head coach at Pittsburgh just
before the game, after then-coach Mike Gottfried was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great bowl. I like El Paso,'' Hackett said. ``It's a
positive experience because I've been there before. After two years
of not going anywhere, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he was unconcerned about playing Purdue twice in
the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care. I don't think it's an issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue is apparently also OK with the thought of a rematch.
Folmer said Boilermakers coach Joe Tiller said: ``That's good as
long as it's not 99 degrees (in El Paso). Then we have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   When the teams played at the Coliseum in August, the temperature
was 118 degrees on the field. It should be about 50-60 degrees
cooler this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough to play a team twice, especially when you
win,'' Palmer said. ``They want revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   USC won the first meeting 27-17 as Palmer led a second-half
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Although bowl bids were not expected to be firmed up until
Saturday, Folmer said so many bowls are worried about getting teams
they desire, that early invitations are being made. Folmer had
hoped to line up Miami as a possible opponent for the Trojans, but
the Hurricanes committed to the PC Micron Bowl in Miami on Tuesday,
to avoid being locked out of postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked to Virginia Tech, but the Hokies committed to the
Music City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was happy to go to the Sun Bowl for another reason. The
Trojans will get more than enough practices because of the Sun
Bowl's late playing date of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC offensive tackle Matt Welch suffered heart
palpitations during the Notre Dame game and was taken to a hospital
following the game. Hackett said he was awaiting test results and
was not sure if Welch would practice Friday, USC's first postseason
workout.... Wide receiver Windrell Hayes has a sprained big toe and
is on crutches but is expected to be available for the Sun Bowl....
Wide receiver Quincy Woods underwent knee surgery Tuesday and will
not return until spring practice.... Defensive tackle Matt
Childers, who is redshirting, underwent shoulder surgery Tuesday
and will also be out until the spring.

MEGAN KANKA'S KILLER SEEKS NEW TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Lawyers for the paroled sex offender who raped
and strangled 7-year-old Megan Kanka in 1994 asked the New Jersey
Supreme Court Tuesday to overturn his murder conviction and death
sentence on grounds including negative pretrial publicity and what
they said were improper prosecution statements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, William Smith and Jay Wilensky, both public
defenders, argued that Jesse Timmendequas, 37, should be granted a
new trial because he was a denied a fair trial in 1997. They cited
articles in The Trentonian and The Trenton Times that they said
created ``rage and hatred'' against Timmendequas that filled Mercer
County and spread into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that the trial judge, Andrew Smithson, changed
his decision to transfer the trial to Camden County and kept it in
Mercer so that the slain girl's family could travel to it more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they maintained, prosecutors improperly
``demonized'' Timmendequas in their statements to the jurors,
``painted him as a monster'' and accused a social worker and
defense witness, Carol Krych, of ``stretching the truth'' in her
descriptions of Timmendequas' upbringing by an abusive father and
adulterous mother.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, they said, also did not receive a report describing
mitigating circumstances about Timmendequas' upbringing that they
said would have helped his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said that the jurors were tainted by their
knowledge of Timmendequas' two earlier convictions for molesting
children. ``Jersey justice can do better than it did,'' Smith told
the seven justices.
</P>
<P>
   The state's representative, Catherine Foddai, a deputy attorney
general, rebutted the defense assertions during her arguments and
in questioning by the justices. In particular, Ms. Foddai said
there was no evidence that the publicity had prejudiced the jurors.
And, she said, all of the jurors said during pretrial questioning
that their verdict would not be influenced by Timmendequas'
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's two-hour hearing, New Jersey Attorney General
Peter Verniero insisted during a news conference that Timmendequas
had received a fair trial. ``The bottom line fact is this defendant
was convicted on overwhelming evidence and in a fair trial,'' he
said. ``The trial judge was scrupulous in insuring this defendant
received a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero attended the hearing with the slain girl's parents,
Maureen and Richard Kanka, who fought after their daughter's murder
for laws that allow for the release of the names and addresses of
paroled sex offenders. The federal government and every state
except New Mexico now have variations of the law, known universally
as ``Megan's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kankas watched Tuesday's hearing calmly. Afterward, Mrs.
Kanka called it a ``waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just amazes me this is the way the process works,'' she
said. ``I really think it's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero explained that Timmendequas, as a death row inmate, was
legally guaranteed several hearings before the New Jersey Supreme
Court, as well as three before the U.S. Supreme Court. He said the
entire appeals process could take between 5 and 15 years. A portion
of the hearing dealt with the impact of the notification law, which
was passed a few months after Megan Kanka's death, on Timmendequas
and whether the jurors aware of the law and its warning system
about sex offenders had inferred that he had committed past sex
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Daniel O'Hern suggested that it would be difficult
finding anyone who did not know about the law and its intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' Smith answered.
</P>
<P>
   Smith contended that jurors learned about Timmendequas' prior
crimes in pretrial publicity and not through their own deductions
about the law and Timmendequas' association with it.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ One team of Huskies, in the midst of a
multiple-time-zone road trip, played tired. The other Huskies, the
nation's newly anointed No. 1 team, was just awful. In the end,
poor-playing Connecticut defeated sleepwalking Washington, 69-48,
Tuesday night in the Great Eight tournament at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final 16 minutes of the game, Connecticut (5-0) looked
as if it wanted to abdicate the No. 1 ranking before it ever got
warm in the throne. But after Washington pulled within a point, the
East Coast Huskies suddenly came to life and went on a 20-2 tear
over the next seven and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Connecticut's player of the year candidate, Richard
Hamilton, who sounded the alarm, scoring 11 of his game-high 17
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But the star point guard Khalid El-Amin was relegated to the
bench with his fourth foul for much of the second half. He was also
feeling the heat from coach Jim Calhoun, who was miffed by
El-Amin's evening of sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hamilton took the help where he could find it: from the
junior forward Kevin Freeman, who added 12 points, six rebounds and
a harassing defensive presence that resulted in a steal and a
blocked shot, and from Albert Mouring, who scored 13 points _ 11 of
them in the first half _ and had five rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut's uneven effort _ 28-of-60 shooting and 22
turnovers _ was enough to bury No. 15 Washington (4-1), which came
here from Hawaii after winning the Big Island Tournament and is in
the midst of a two-week, 7,000-mile road swing.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast Huskies shot a dismal 19 of 55 from the field and
never got their 7-foot Canadian, Todd MacCulloch, untracked. He led
Washington with 13 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin finished with 10 points and five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's second game of the Great Eight _ a two-night
event that features five of the nation's top 10 teams _ No. 7
Kansas (4-0) played No. 8 Kentucky (5-1).
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's games, No. 21 Utah (3-2) will meet Rhode Island
(3-3), and No. 4 Duke (4-1) will play No. 9 Michigan State (4-1).
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's battle of the Huskies, it was the team from
the West Coast that had more to think about than taking on the
top-ranked team. In one of the most thrilling games of the 1998
NCAA tournament, Connecticut deprived Washington of a berth in the
Round of 8 when a loose ball found its way to Hamilton, who
uncorked a fallaway jumper at the buzzer for a 75-74 victory in an
East Regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   But neither vengeance nor an upset appeared to be within the
grasp of Washington in the first half Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washington turned the ball over eight times in the first half
and shot just 34.5 percent _ in ugly fashion, too. The junior guard
Deon Luton, who had shot 55 percent in Hawaii, rimmed a wide-open
dunk, and the sophomore Chris Walcott muffed a wide-open alley-oop
during a calamitous four-minute stretch in which Washington failed
to score.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's bunch did not look much better even while running off
a 13-point lead. El-Amin telegraphed one breakaway pass and threw
away another, and Hamilton was called for walking under the basket.
In total, Connecticut gave the ball up 15 times in the first half,
but shot 46.8 percent despite Hamilton's 2-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Mouring, however, came off the bench for 11 points in 11
minutes. Those minutes came at the expense of El-Amin, who, after
his fourth first-half turnover, was yanked off the court with 48.6
seconds left. Washington had drawn within seven points, and Calhoun
was not happy with his floor leader's effort.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin dug a deeper hole with his coach when he was put back in
the game with 4.4 seconds left, presumably to run a final play. The
chunky point guard raced the length of the court on the dribble.
The drive managed only to get him his third foul, for charging.
</P>
<P>
   In the tunnel on the way to the locker room at halftime, his
team up by 35-27, Calhoun stayed on El-Amin. ``You still got all
the answers?'' he barked at the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Huskies, he really didn't.

EXXON-MOBIL DEAL WON'T AFFECT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Exxon Corp.'s marriage to Mobil Corp. may create
the world's largest corporation, but it will cause barely a ripple
in Southern California, the world's biggest gasoline market,
analysts and company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil is a big local player with 581 gasoline stations spread
across Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, third behind Arco and Unocal.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has a 15.64 percent market share, which also places it
third.
</P>
<P>
   Neither number will change much.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon pulled out of the Los Angeles market in 1992, prompting
lawsuits by many of its 156 dealers. It has recently re-entered the
local market with only a handful of stations.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, Arco, long known as the industry's
low-price leader, has a 30.32 percent share, according to Tulsa,
Okla.-based Whitney Leigh Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cherko, owner of a Mobil station in Beverly Hills and a
director of Auto Cal, a trade group that represents service station
owners, thinks the new company will pretty much leave the local
scene alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see many changes. Mobil is a recognized brand name,
and I don't think they will give that up,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in order to take market share away from Arco in
Southern California, Exxon Mobil would have to slash prices to
compete at the expense of profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to increase profits. I don't see much changing out
there for the foreseeable future,'' said McDonald J. Beavers,
Whitney Leigh's president.

N.Y. TIMES RADIO STATION LEASED TO DISNEY FOR KIDS' PROGRAMMING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Radio station WQEW, this city's sole broadcaster of
American popular standards, will be leased to ABC for eight years
for children's programming by a Walt Disney Co. radio network,
officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by ABC and the station's current owner, The New
York Times Co., said the agreement gives ABC the right to buy the
station, 1560 on the AM dial, after eight years. The financial
terms were not disclosed, and executives at both companies declined
to discuss them Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One executive valued the deal at around $40 million, but would
not break it down into the lease and purchase components.
</P>
<P>
   Station employees said that midnight Dec. 27 was set for the
switch from round-the-clock big band and swing music to 24-hour
children's programming by Radio Disney, which already has outlets
in 35 markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The format, intended for youngsters under 12, combines Top 40
songs, call-in segments, news and sports for the children's market.
The show is on nonstop not because children listen throughout the
night, ABC officials said, but because ABC and its parent company,
Disney, want to maintain control over the programming to assure its
suitability. The late-night hours are to be given over to ballads
to lull children who may be listening to sleep, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year lease, known in the industry as a ``local
marketing agreement,'' does not affect The Times Co.'s other
station, WQXR-FM (96.3). Both stations broadcast from studios at
122 Fifth Ave. The company's chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said,
``We believe that The New York Times Company can continue to best
serve radio listeners in the New York metropolitan area through its
ongoing commitment to WQXR-FM, our premier classical music
station.''
</P>
<P>
   The staffs of both stations were informed of the agreement
Tuesday morning in a meeting with C. Frank Roberts, president and
chief executive officer of The Times Co.'s Broadcast Group. Some
employees said later that they were instructed not to talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Roberts announced the appointment of a new
president and general manager of WQXR, Thomas Bartunek, who had
been vice president for programming and operations. The post had
been vacant since the retirement of the previous president, Warren
Bodow, in May.
</P>
<P>
   The WQEW switch leaves New York City without a popular standards
outlet for the first time since 1992, when the music's longtime
home on WNEW-AM was sold to Michael Bloomberg LP as a financial
news station. The Times Co. then dropped classical music from its
WQXR-AM station and adopted the standards format on the station,
renamed WQEW.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Schwartz, longtime host of weekend Frank Sinatra and
swing shows on WQEW and before that on WNEW-AM, and the artistic
director of a new ``American Songbook'' standards series at Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts, said Tuesday that an urgent search
for a new spot on the dial was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am involved in a fervent and realistic way with a group of
people anxious to relocate what I call American classical music and
keep it there forever,'' he said. He called the discussions
``ongoing and progressive'' and said some of those interested were
``people who have money.''
</P>
<P>
   While clearly unhappy at the switchover, he said, ``I believe
that life is a tragedy filled with joy. WQEW is a joy.'' He said
that while there was little prospect of finding a new home before
Dec. 27, ``my job is to close that gap with the speed of a tennis
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Disney, which already broadcasts in 12 of the top 20
markets in the nation, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago,
Dallas, Atlanta and Boston, would be the first all-children's radio
format in New York City. The public radio station WNYC (AM-820)
airs a children's show, ``New York Kids'' from 6 to 8 p.m. Sundays
with co-hosts David Gonzales and Florence Barrau. The show draws
5,000 calls a week, said Laura Walker, president of WNYC. She said
she welcomed the arrival of Radio Disney. ``Anything that will get
kids to tune in a radio is good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although its origins go back to the early 1920s, radio is being
rediscovered by youngsters, market research suggests. Michael
Cohen, a developmental psychologist and partner in a Manhattan
marketing firm, Applied Research and Consulting, said that unlike
adults, children do not divide media into radio and television,
network and cable, books, magazines, movies and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids, it's more oceanic,'' he said. ``Kids are quite open
to having many stars in their media constellation.''

 &HT;    First grader killed by school bus
 &HT;    By Brandon Peterson

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Dayton first-grader was fatally run over by a
school bus Tuesday afternoon after he left the bus, then ran back
as the driver started up again, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pendleton, 6, was taken to Franciscan Medical Center,
where he was pronounced dead of multiple trauma injuries at 4:26
p.m., according to a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton, a pupil at City Day Community School who had
celebrated a birthday Nov. 20, was struck after he and another
pupil were dropped off at the day care center at the Dayton Boys
and Girls Club, according to Dayton Police Sgt. George D. Hammann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy exited the bus, and for some reason returned to the
street to pick up something,'' Hammann aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hammann said the driver, who said she had seen both youngsters
on the sidewalk before she moved the bus, felt a thud under the
left rear tire and witnesses told the driver to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Children and adults stood behind yellow police tape as police
detectives marked streets and photographed the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was anything anyone ever wanted in a little boy,'' said
Jane Dixon, principal of City Day Community School, a charter
school. Dixon was visibly shaken as she gazed at the small Nike
tennis shoe and black hat in the street behind the school bus. ``He
had it all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Kirby, executive director of safety, security and
transportation for Dayton City Schools, said 15 children were on
the bus at the time. Kirby identified the driver as Sue Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Schools employee records list the driver's name as Sharon
Sue Elkins, employed with Dayton City Schools since April 25, 1984.
Kirby said Elkins had no disciplinary marks against her.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins was taken to Dayton Police Department Third District
headquarters for a urine specimen and questioning _ standard
procedure, according to Hammann.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Dayton City Schools must transport students who attend
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby said the incident is something that shakes everyone
involved with Dayton City Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a traumatic experience for kids and parents,'' Kirby
said. ``I pray every day that something like this doesn't
happen...This is the kind of thing you never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It was believed the first school bus fatality in the area since
the Feb. 27, 1995, death of Brandie Browder, 13, who was killed
when her jacket drawstring snagged in the handrail of a Beavercreek
school bus and she was dragged under the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accident was similar to an April 15 mishap in Wooster,
Ohio, where a kindergarten student was run over and killed by her
school bus just after she had stepped off the vehicle near her
home. The driver, Ross Winkler, failed to see that Cherice Duncan,
6, was in front of the bus when he pulled forward, police said.
Witnesses said the girl had bent down to pick up a piece of paper.
The driver stopped when he heard someone outside the bus yelling.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fatality occurred in Oxford, Ark., on Aug. 21. A
7-year-old boy was crushed by the rear wheels of the school bus
that had just dropped him off near his home, state police said.

 &HT;    Georgia in running for AOL facility
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cobb County is one of three Southeastern sites America
Online Inc. is considering for a $500 million computer operations
center. AOL is expected to make a decision by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic about this,'' said Cobb Commission Chairman Bill
Byrne, who confirmed AOL is looking at a location in Smyrna for a
major facility. Besides the economic impact of the jobs it would
bring here, the presence of AOL _ a nationally prominent company _
would bolster Atlanta's image as a technology center.
</P>
<P>
   Other county and state economic development officials confirmed
a major technology company is in the final stages of a selection
process that includes a site in Smyrna. But they cited
confidentiality agreements and declined to identify AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest commercial online service, with
about 14 million subscribers and 20 million users. In 1998, the
company reported revenue of $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The economic development officials said the prospect they've
been courting will build at least a 350,000-square-foot building
and invest $500 million, a figure that includes support technology
as well as the building. The firm will employ about 200 skilled
technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   A representative at AOL's headquarters in Dulles, Va., wouldn't
comment on the company's plans. ``It is premature to discuss any
infrastructure growth plans at this point,'' said Wendy Goldberg.
``We are always working to provide a state-of-the-art experience
for our members. We have just completed a 180,000-square-foot data
center in Northern Virginia that still has a great deal of capacity
that we haven't tapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But state and local economic development officials said Tuesday
they have been working through a Morristown, N.J., site selection
consulting firm _ Wadley-Donovan Group _ for the past several
months on a project that involves the location of a technology
center. They say the company has narrowed its list of possible
sites to Charlotte, Vienna, Va., and Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a data center project,'' said Randy Cardoza,
commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and
Tourism, when asked about the prospect of AOL. ``We have been
working with a consultant on a project that fits the specifications
and requirements of what you are talking about. I'm confident that
Georgia is going to compete very well on this type of project as we
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael H.S. Hughes, director of Cobb County's Office of
Economic Development, would not identify the project as AOL but
said, ``We are in a very delicate stage in discussions. We have
presented information about incentives. And they haven't made a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn M. Pitts, Georgia Power's general manager for projects,
also said a technology company is close to making a decision on a
Cobb location. While declining to name the company, he said, ``This
would be a prize catch.''

ALBANY LAWMAKERS MANEUVER TOWARD A RAISE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The State Assembly passed a 38 percent salary
increase Tuesday for New York's elected officials, and the leader
of the Senate said his house would pass it on Wednesday, leaving it
up to Gov. George Pataki to decide what he will demand from the
legislature in return for allowing the raise to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader, said the
Senate would also pass a bill mandating that if the legislature
fails to pass a state budget on time, its members will lose the pay
increase for the remainder of the year. That provision was one of
several that he said the Senate would approve Wednesday to appease
the governor. Others include a bill permitting charter schools and
one abolishing tenure for school principals.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans' gambit is this: to lay before Pataki, a
fellow Republican who opposes the salary increase, a number of
attractive options, leaving it up to him to decide which of them he
will demand that the Democratic-controlled Assembly pass in return
for a raise. It is also a politically shrewd move by Bruno to
address the failing by the legislature that has attracted the
greatest derision: 14 consecutive years of late budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office declined to comment on the legislature's
maneuvering. His communications director, Zenia Mucha, referred
reporters to the governor's remarks Monday, when he said, ``I don't
think a pay raise for legislators, standing alone, is justified,''
but would not say that he intended to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, leaders of both houses said that, unwilling to
take the risk of public ire without a guaranteed reward, they would
not pass a bill unless they had a firm agreement with the governor
that he would allow it to become law. But legislators have been
emboldened by Pataki's statements that while he opposes a raise, he
would accept it in return for other legislation he values.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver told reporters Tuesday that he
was putting the bill to a vote without a deal because, ``I think
it's important to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Few subjects make legislators more skittish. They overwhelmingly
want a raise, which would be their first in 10 years, but they do
not want to be seen by the public as clamoring for it, and they did
not openly raise the prospect until after they were safely
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly voted 86-55 to approve the pay raise bill Tuesday,
without a single lawmaker rising to debate it. The vote fell
largely along party lines, with Democrats 78-14 in favor and
Republicans 41-8 against.
</P>
<P>
   But the real division was geographical, with the great majority
of upstate legislators voting against giving themselves a raise.
Lawmakers from upstate regions, where their salaries go farther and
many of their constituents are poor, have found it harder to speak
out in favor of increasing their own pay.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the salaries of legislators and
statewide elected officials 38 percent, which legislators have
described as merely keeping up with the cost of living since their
last raise.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators' base salaries would rise to $79,500 from $57,500 a
year. With stipends that most of them receive for leadership and
committee posts, the average total salary would rise from more than
$66,000 to more than $91,000, second in the country only to
California's legislative pay.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pay of the lieutenant governor, attorney general and
comptroller would go to $151,500 from $110,000. Under a separate
resolution _ needed because the governor cannot sign a bill dealing
with his own salary _ Pataki's salary would rise to $179,000 from
$130,000. The Assembly passed that resolution 106-36.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, whose pay has been frozen since 1993, would see a 21
percent increase under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki, Bruno and Silver have been negotiating since
Monday on a bill to allow charter schools, which are specialized
public schools, sometimes privately run, sometimes with heavy input
from parents, that operate largely outside the educational
bureaucracy. There has been little progress in those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has ardently sought charter schools, but his version is
opposed by both houses and the teachers' unions. The governor's
proposal would free the schools from some of the restrictions of
the unions' contracts, and allow schools to be created without the
oversight of the state Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bruno's proposal, if the legislature goes even a minute
past the start of the fiscal year, it would forfeit the pay raise
for the rest of that calendar year. He also said the Senate might
vote to make the state's fiscal year, which now begins April 1,
start later.
</P>
<P>
   Many Assembly Democrats objected to the senator's proposal, but
would not say whether they might swallow it to gain the raise.

PACT WILL PROVIDE MINORITY HOUSING IN YONKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bringing to a close a major theater of battle in a legal
conflict that has had Yonkers, N.Y., in its grip since 1986, New
York state agreed Tuesday to pay $16.4 million to help the city
build new housing and buy existing homes in white neighborhoods for
black and Hispanic families.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision still leaves simmering the educational issues
in the desegregation litigation that began in 1980, when the
Justice Department and later the NAACP accused Yonkers of
intentionally maintaining segregated schools by confining black and
Hispanic families in the southwestern corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in a financially embattled city whose schools have lost a
substantial share of their white students over the years, officials
were more troubled about how they would address the judicial
finding that Yonkers housing patterns had contributed to racially
segregated schools. Thus, Tuesday's settlement, with the state's
agreement to pay half of the costs for a package of 740 homes,
brought expressions of unusual delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy about that,'' said Mayor John Spencer, who
has led the city since January 1996. ``The taxpayers of Yonkers
have been carrying the burden all by ourselves for too long and
it's something as mayor I've been talking about for years. I think
to the state's credit they've recognized their culpability.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, whose administration had at first fought the
demand by Yonkers that it help pay for a housing plan, seemed
pleased that this political hot potato would be put behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But putting aside old divisions and focusing on a better
future for the people of Yonkers, we have reached an important
settlement that finally brings an end to the years of litigation in
the Yonkers housing desegregation case,'' the governor said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement commits the state over the next five years to pay
$7.5 million to help mostly minority families buy 600 single-family
homes and condominiums (including subsidies of as much as $20,000
for the lowest-earning families) for down payments, closing costs
and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The state will also have to pay $6.4 million for building 118
new houses and rental apartments in three locations in Yonkers _
Yonkers Avenue, Hoover Road and East Grassy Sprain Road. Yonkers is
about to break ground on a fourth site required by the federal
court order _ 22 homes on Cross Street _ that the state will not
finance.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of the complicated package is a promise by the
State of New York Mortgage Agency to make available $100 million in
low-interest loans for families buying homes. Raymond Fitzpatrick
Jr., an Atlanta lawyer who has represented the city of Yonkers in
the desegregation case, said the value of reducing the interest on
the mortgages amounted to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The path toward Tuesday's settlement was broken last Feb. 5,
when Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan found
that the state bore a sizable share of responsibility for
segregated patterns of housing in Yonkers. The judge found that a
state agency, Urban Development Corp., chose in the 1960s and '70s
to build many of its low-income apartment houses in southwest
Yonkers, where the majority of black and Hispanic residents already
lived, thus aggravating segregated housing patterns that had
contributed to school segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments Tuesday, Sand showed the ebullience of a jurist
who could glimpse the conclusion of a case he has presided over for
almost two decades of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many occasions since the outset of this
litigation in 1980, when I sat on this bench experiencing
frustration, and a failure to appreciate why, when the parties had
the same objectives, it was so difficult to reach a consensus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' he continued. ``The goal of increasing
housing opportunities in Yonkers will be materially implemented.
There will, at long last, be an end to this phase of this ongoing
saga.''

STARS COME UP ACES ON ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars begin a four-game road trip today intent on settling
once and for all their one oppressing controversy: So who is the
best card player on this team, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's a debate that rages intensely throughout the locker room
and brings an overflow of emotion at times. But it's also a debate
that underscores just how close the team can be _ and why taking
this team on the road can sometimes be the best thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing cards is something you look forward to when you get on
the road,'' winger Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``That's part of why
the road can be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will play 10 of the next 12 games away from Reunion
Arena and will not play three consecutive home games until
February. Such is the cost of a schedule that has had them play
just seven of their first 19 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But while the road can be crippling to some teams, it has proved
to be a friend to the Stars over the past two seasons. The Stars
were the top road team in the NHL last season with a 23-14-4
record, and they have the best road record over the past two
seasons at 46-27-9. And while they're off to a 3-2-2 start on the
road this season, they are an even more impressive 3-0-1 in their
past four road games.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there seems to be a trend here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is something that we take a lot of pride in,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think one of the reasons we've
been so successful on the road is that we've had a different hero
every night. Whether it be \RMike\S Keane or \RBrian\S Skrudland or
\RGuy\S Carbonneau or \RDave\S Reid, we've had different players
step up. And I think the players know that going on the road that
they're really counted on _ so it's kind of the attitude of no
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also an attitude that every game will come down to a
close finish. Last season, the Stars had 30 of their 41 road games
decided by two goals or fewer. They were 9-5 in one-goal road
games. It's an intensity level that keeps players on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty part, we really don't play any different on
the road than we do at home,'' winger Pat Verbeek said. ``We try to
be the same team every time we go out on the ice, and that's one
reason we're able to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, some of the players believe the Stars tend to
emphasize defense a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the road, you probably play a game where you
want to buckle everything down and play solid D, and we've shown
that's the kind of game we play best,'' winger Grant Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only difference of opinion between Marshall
and Verbeek. Marshall is a part of the ``schnarpels'' card game.
Verbeek prefers the game of euchre. Members of each running game
consider themselves the best card players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to brag or anything, but I think I'm ranked No. 1
right now,'' Langenbrunner said, offering his partner Verbeek as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie?'' Verbeek responded when asked about the No. 1 status.
``Uh, no, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall claimed himself as the top schnarpels player and said
their game _ played by the likes of Keane and Carbonneau _ is
considered the ``A'' game. Langenbrunner defended the euchre table
and its members, which include Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk, as
the best.
</P>
<P>
   And while the upcoming road trips don't promise an end to the
card-playing controversy, that players are able to get back into a
full-swing tournament could result in better chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at home, you have other things to do. You might
hang out for an hour and play pingpong or something like that, but
usually everyone is on the move,'' Langenbrunner said. ``But when
we get on the road, we really get time to spend together as a team.
I think that makes a difference.''

EDITORIAL: ILLEGAL USE OF SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 2:
</P>
<P>
   To everyone except the partisans, it has always been obvious
that President Clinton and Bob Dole violated campaign spending laws
in the 1996 election. Now the Federal Election Commission staff has
advanced the cause of honest politics by studying both campaigns
and formally concluding that the candidates broke the law and
should pay millions of dollars to the federal government as
punishment. The conclusion by commission auditors and counsel, made
public yesterday, should help close the soft-money loophole that
has destroyed the campaign finance laws. It should also finally
prod Attorney General Janet Reno to get an independent counsel to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Though widely expected, the auditors' conclusion laid out in
unmistakable detail what this page has argued since the 1996
campaign: that the Clinton team eviscerated the letter and spirit
of the election laws by pledging to limit spending in return for
federal subsidies, and then using the party apparatus to raise and
spend money for ad campaigns. The Dole campaign, no less clearly,
did the same thing, except that Dole was probably not as directly
involved in the fund-raising and advertising strategy as the
president was. It was Clinton, after all, who turned the White
House into a coffee and sleepover bazaar for donors.
</P>
<P>
   The three Republican and three Democratic members of the Federal
Election Commission must do their duty and adopt the findings of
the auditors and the legal counsel. The commission has been
notoriously partisan and weak-kneed in the last few years, but it
can now take the opportunity to do the right thing, knowing that
both parties were equally guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Washington are already saying that the
commissioners should at least waive the repayments on the ground
that the parties thought they were behaving legally. That would be
a travesty. The commission should insist on the repayments and then
go on to close the so-called soft-money loophole for presidential
and congressional campaigns, for now and forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the commission has ruled against presidential
candidates who tried to raise and spend money for their campaigns
outside the regular limits by setting up separate committees. Some
of the presidential candidates are already starting to adopt that
practice again, knowing that the commission has been lax. The
commission can now make this principle clear: Any money spent for a
presidential or congressional candidate must adhere to longstanding
federal laws, whether it is raised or spent by a so-called
independent committee or by a political party.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, with her eye more on protecting the
president than enforcing the law, has looked for ways around her
obligation to seek an independent counsel to investigate Clinton.
Whatever excuse she had is now gone. Even if the commissioners do
not accept the commission's staff recommendation, it is obvious
that someone not beholden to the president needs to look into the
1996 fund-raising fiasco. If Ms. Reno calls for someone to look at
both Democratic and Republican use of soft money, so much the
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission's finding comes as the House
Judiciary Committee has decided to add campaign finance violations
to its impeachment inquiry. This page supports aggressive
congressional investigations into such matters, conducted in a
bipartisan spirit. Now that the staff of the commission has found
that Dole and Clinton violated the law, it should be obvious that
such an investigation not be tied to the impeachment proceedings.
Let the commission and Ms. Reno do their duty first. Congress can
then pass campaign finance reform and extend the soft-money ban to
ads sponsored by independent groups. That step would complete the
process of cleaning up the laws that turned the 1996 campaign into
one of the most corrupt in modern history.

HEAVY SECURITY IN PLACE FOR SMALL AIDS MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Slightly fewer than 200 demonstrators commemorating
World AIDS Day converged peacefully Tuesday in front of City Hall
in Manhattan, where they were confronted by metal detectors and a
phalanx of police officers and corraled behind steel barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers accused the city of changing the ground rules for the
rally and giving them less access to the area than a court order
allowed. The protesters, many carrying placards bearing the names
of AIDS victims, began with a march down Broadway from Houston
Street in a single lane of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The events were organized by Housing Works, an AIDS service
agency that has been engaged in a legal battle with the city over
public access to City Hall. A federal appeals court this week
barred the protesters from setting foot on City Hall's 11 steps,
but said demonstrators could hold their rally in the plaza in front
of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration marked the first event staged in front of City
Hall by anyone other than the city since mid-August, when the
police department began Operation Bravo, a plan to tighten security
in lower Manhattan to stave off terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As marchers neared City Hall, they were flanked by about 80
police officers on motorcycles and on foot. A police helicopter
hovered above for the duration of the march.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, the police and organizers argued over the number
of protesters who could enter the grounds and what areas were off
limits. The police scanned the crowd from the roof of City Hall.
Demonstrators were forced to walk through metal detectors to get to
the rally area. A small number of demonstrators were allowed into a
barricaded pen where a news conference took place, but most were
herded behind metal railings in a parking lot. A third pen held
reporters and television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   City Department of Environmental Protection inspectors carried
noise meters to insure that the demonstrators were in compliance
with the city's noise code, as the names of AIDS victims were read
aloud over a loudspeaker in a 24-hour vigil.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said there was no intent to curtail freedom of
speech, and that the security precautions were routine. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani told reporters later that metal detectors had also
been in place for the celebrations at City Hall of the Yankees'
World Series victory and for John Glenn's recent space flight.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the city should not be blamed for preparing for a
larger number of demonstrators. ``We can't help it if these people
exaggerate their turnout,'' he said. The organizers had hoped to
attract 550 marchers.

EDITORIAL: A SPECIAL-ED WARNING FOR NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has warned that New York City could lose
federal aid if it continues to shunt disproportionate numbers of
black and Latino children into special education. The city is a
legitimate target. But the segregation that has raised red flags in
Washington, D.C., is common throughout the state _ and is due in
part to a funding formula that penalizes districts that reduce
special-education enrollment while rewarding those who keep
enrollment as high as possible and have the highest per-pupil
special-ed expenditures. Unless New York state junks this formula,
it could find itself stripped of special-education aid and in
violation of federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in two years that the federal Education
Department's civil rights division has questioned why New York City
funnels disproportionate numbers of black and Latino students into
special-education classes, which often become holding pens for
children who learn nothing and rarely graduate. The Board of
Education agreed last year to take specific steps to alleviate the
problem. But in last month's follow-up, federal officials noted
that many schools were still warehousing blacks and Latinos as well
as children whose first language is not English.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's
Office of Civil Rights found that African-American children in
schools where the principals, faculty and student body are mainly
white are most likely to end up in special-education classes. The
highest incidence of referrals is found in schools with low poverty
rates, high reading and math scores and large numbers of
experienced, permanently certified teachers. Theoretically, these
schools would be best equipped to deal with students who might need
extra help. But these children are often dumped into special ed
even when diagnostic tests reveal no need for it.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic stereotypes play a role in disproportionate referrals.
But so does the desire to get under-prepared children out of
mainstream classes so they will not be tested, bringing down
schoolwide scores. In addition, children are sometimes sent to
special ed because mainstream teachers lack the time or skill to
help them with basic reading problems, the prime cause of
special-education referrals.
</P>
<P>
   This process is driven by a ``spend-to-get'' state funding
formula that awards special-education aid based on how much schools
spend for this purpose _ and makes it fiscal suicide for them to
shrink their programs. State Education Commissioner Richard Mills
addressed the funding question two years ago when he proposed
increasing support for mainstream classrooms while doing away with
the incentives that lead schools to isolate students in
special-education classes. But Gov. George Pataki failed to back
this proposal, as did legislators from suburban Long Island, who
use special-education aid as a way to subsidize public education
without resorting to higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The best response is to enact Mills' proposal, bolstering
mainstream education and removing the financial incentives for
special ed. School districts can do it now while there is time to
think it through, or rush later when the federal government presses
their backs to the wall.

JANKOVICH NAMED INTERIM AD AT NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Sam Jankovich is no baby-sitter. When he
turns over the athletic department to a permanent replacement
sometime next year, he intends to leave behind a blueprint for the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, as expected, became Cal State Northridge's interim
athletic director on Tuesday. CSUN president Blenda Wilson
hand-picked the 64-year-old former University of Miami and
Washington State athletic director to steer an oft-troubled program
toward stability.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who introduced Jankovich at an afternoon news
conference, also announced a change in CSUN's command structure.
Jankovich, and his replacement, will report directly to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the athletic director reported to Ron Kopita, the
vice president of student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich's term began immediately and will run at least through
June 30, 1999, or until a permanent replacement is selected for the
athletic director's job. A national search for a replacement is
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings the kind of background, experience, integrity,
knowledge of the collegiate sports world that we are certainly
looking for,'' Wilson said. ``It gives our student-athletes, our
coaches and our supporters a sense of stability and integrity and
confidence in our ability to move forward with the sports
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Former athletic director Paul Bubb quit under administrative
pressure Nov. 6 in the aftermath of women's basketball coach
Michael Abraham's arrest on federal drug charges and subsequent
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bubb's resignation, CSUN was without an athletic director.
Men's basketball coach Bobby Braswell served as
``administrator-in-charge'' of the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich wields complete power with the authority to hire and
fire coaches, as well as extend and renew contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be more of a fact-finding mission than
anything else,'' Jankovich said. ``You won't see any abrupt changes
or decisions, but there will be a tremendous amount of meetings _
individually, collectively, with coaches, with student-athletes,
with administrators, with Dr. Wilson's cabinet, faculty and people
on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming here I want to look at it like I'm going to be the
athletic director here for 15 to 20 years. Anything we do is going
to be looking at the long range.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich will be paid from a base annual salary of $112,008,
which works out to $9,334 per month. Bubb was paid $86,700
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, who spends most of his time in Hayden Lake, Idaho,
will live in the area. He said he isn't interested in being the
permanent athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go ahead and analyze what we're doing internally, as
far as raising money and selling tickets and getting people
involved,'' Jankovich said. ``But most important of all _
networking. There's no room for negativism. I really do not care to
hear complaints about people who were here before. I want to find
out the strengths of the program, and what can we do to build on
the strengths of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious discussions between Wilson and Jankovich began two weeks
ago after Charles Reed, chancellor of the California State
University system, spoke with Jankovich.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has known Jankovich for 15 years, dating back to their days
in Florida. Reed headed Florida's university system when Jankovich
was at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Jankovich knows college sports, that's No.1,'' Reed said.
``No.2, he's a tough guy. They could use some of that there now.
No.3, he has a great network in college sports, and that network
will really help Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Jankovich's strengths is fund raising, a weak area for
CSUN. Before his arrival at Miami, the school raised less than
$400,000 in 1983. Five years later, Miami raised $3 million in
athletic funds.
</P>
<P>
   There was also turmoil within the athletic program at Miami
during Jankovich's seven-year reign. He hired Jimmy Johnson to
coach the Hurricanes, but he was also there during the time in
which the school was investigated and sanctioned by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Among the NCAA's findings during part of Jankovich's tenure
were: excessive financial aid given to athletes, excessive benefits
provided to athletes by fraudulent Pell Grants, improper employment
of football players during the school year, cash awards for
athletes for performance and a lack of institutional control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what happened there and he took actions to improve
that, to clean up that,'' Reed said. ``He changed some of the
policies, and we all know who he was working with. He understands
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, who left Miami in 1990 to become CEO of the New
England Patriots before being ousted in 1993, has spent the last
few years as a consultant. He's a graduate of the University of
Montana, a fellow Big Sky Conference school, and worked at
Washington State with current Big Sky associate commissioner Kathy
Noble. Early in his career, Jankovich was an assistant football
coach at Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Jankovich is working with Miami on the development of
a new, on-campus multi-use arena, but he said that wouldn't take
away from his position at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell and Jankovich had breakfast Tuesday morning. Wilson
then held a lunch for the coaches and athletic administration to
meet Jankovich.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich said he plans on meeting with the head coaches next
week.

EDITORIAL: THE NEW OIL BEHEMOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 2:
</P>
<P>
   It was only two decades ago that the oil industry seemed to be
sitting astride the global economy. Oil prices were high and were
expected to continue rising indefinitely, much of the developed
world was facing economic difficulties caused in part by high
energy prices, and there was fear that inflation would never be
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly everything has changed, and a struggling oil industry
is seeking security through combination as it confronts prices
that, adjusted for inflation, are lower than those that prevailed
before the first oil shock a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some causes of low prices, such as warm weather, could change
rapidly. Others, such as Asia's recession, will not be with us
forever. But the low prices also reflect a technological revolution
that has transformed the energy industry. Companies are less likely
to drill dry holes, and are able to get more oil from what they do
find. Chemical plants and refineries can push out far more product
than they once did. Increased production is good for any one
company, but not for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It is against that backdrop that the merger wave must be viewed.
Exxon is buying Mobil only months after British Petroleum agreed to
buy Amoco. Two big European companies, Total and Petrofina, also
are combining.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about how John D. Rockefeller's old
Standard Oil is being put together decades after antitrust
regulators tore it apart. But these deals are far different. The
industry has spent much of the last decade cutting costs as much as
it could. Now it seeks savings from consolidation, and companies
fear being the last one to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators in many countries will carefully examine
the Exxon-Mobil merger, and some divestitures will no doubt be
needed. But these deals do not reflect either power over markets or
a hope of attaining such power. The oil business is a harshly
competitive one in which many companies are only beginning to
adjust to this year's plunge in prices. Mobil and Exxon say their
merger will enable them to cut employment by 9,000 jobs, or around
7 percent, and cut capital spending by $1.5 billion, or 10 percent,
but there is a good chance some of those cuts would have been made
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Big oil remains profitable. Fred Leuffer, an analyst at Bear
Stearns, forecasts that 1998 profits of Mobil and Exxon combined
will total $8.5 billion. But earnings are falling, and will be
under continued pressure if oil prices do not recover sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most revealing comment came in the form of a denial
by Lucio Noto, the Mobil chairman. ``This is not,'' he told
reporters, ``a combination based on desperation.'' No such denial
would have been needed even a few years ago.

BANKROLL AVAILABLE ON BANKED TRACK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Balance athletic shoe company has thrown down
the challenge: $10,000 to the man who can run a sub-four-minute
mile or to the woman who can break 4:33 at the New Balance Games on
Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The event is being staged at the old Fort Washington Armory's
Track and Field Center in Washington Heights. Runners used to say
the armory's unyielding wooden floors slowed their times and left
them with splinters in their knees if they fell.
</P>
<P>
   But a state-of-the-art Mondo banked track is being installed at
the historic facility on 168th Street and will be ready for the
competition. It is hoped that the new track will not only restore
the armory to its former glory, when it was known as the region's
premier indoor running track, but also establish its future as one
of the fastest surfaces in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achieving a sub-four-minute mile will establish prestige for
our facility and create a positive buzz in the running community,''
said Dr. Norbert Sander, president of the Track and Field Center
and the man who spearheaded the armory's restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the New Balance Mile Challenge, the invitational event
will feature elite runners from around the world. Among those
expected in the men's field are the American Olympians Tom Nohilly,
a steeplechaser, and Mark Coogan, a marathoner. The women's field
will most likely include two leading American milers, Alisa Harvey
Hill and Kathy Franey, and Irish Olympian Sinead Delahunty.
</P>
<P>
   The featured mile will be the main event at the fourth annual
New Balance Games, a daylong track and field competition featuring
some of the area's top high school athletes.
</P>
<P>
   If both a man and a woman meet the challenge, they will share
the $10,000 purse.

COMMENTARY: A ROCK'S ROLE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the years since they took a ramshackle loft in
Mott Haven and turned it into Vamos a la Pena del Bronx, Victor
Toro and Nieves Ayress have become used to laboring in obscurity.
Relying on little more than the hearts and hands of friends and
neighbors, they created a community center where immigrants get
free food to strengthen their bodies, English lessons to nurture
their future and music-filled festivals to sustain their culture.
</P>
<P>
   They're the kind of people Toro worked with in his native Chile,
where he organized workers in the mines, factories and shanty
towns. The country's regime took notice and jailed him for three
years before expelling him in the 1970s. It's the other way around
in his exile in the Bronx, where officials just ignore him. Call it
disappearance through indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get by with the support of the community,'' said Toro, who
looks like a romantic poet with his intense dark eyes and tousled
white hair. ``We never ask for anything for ourselves. We give it
all to the people. We write proposals and tried for some of the
money the politicians get for community development, but in 11
years we never got any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Toro is being noticed at last. On Thursday his group and 10
others that work with AIDS patients, the hungry or the forgotten
will each receive $50,000 grants from the Union Square Awards to
support grass-roots self-help efforts that strengthen social bonds
in the weakest of neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The awards' benefactor made a trade: The groups got his money
and in turn he assumed their former invisibility. In an age when
``Anonymous'' became a gimmicky novelistic pseudonym and
deep-pocket donors emblazon their names on buildings, parks or
plaques, he insisted on staying unknown because he wanted the
spotlight to fall on those who labor unheralded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real unrecognized strength in these communities
that gets lost in the commentary of looking in from the outside,''
said Vincent McGee, a foundation executive who knew the donor and
helped helped him establish the endowment for the annual awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the U.S. has been to take people in and give
them a leg up and encourage them to do things on their own. If
these people don't succeed, we are in trouble in this city in terms
of a politically disenfranchised group facing an increasing
distance between the rich and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The donor, whom McGee identified only as Peter, bridged that gap
in his life and his philanthropy. He came from an immigrant family
that went from pushcarts to wealth. He was an artist and a
successful investor who used his resources quietly to support human
rights and peace groups.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Peter approached McGee to help him refine his
thinking on philanthropy and help groups that did hands-on work
with issues like hunger, AIDS and immigration. He had struggled
with cancer himself.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago, Peter's education on these issues
kicked into high gear. Doctors told him that the cancer he thought
he had beaten had returned. He had 10 weeks to live.
</P>
<P>
   McGee took him to the Fund for the City of New York, which
eventually administered the awards. Despite the literal deadline,
Peter proved to be focused and passionate as he learned how to take
his vision and make it real. Most important, he listened to what
groups needed to continue their work rather than insist he had some
magic program to solve society's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of life in foundations is that they tend to produce
arrogance and a kind of intellectual corruption,'' McGee said.
``People looking for funds tell you what they think you want to
hear. Peter understood all that and he wanted to break though all
that. Part of the problem about foundations is that they take the
passion out of the people who are working for them. It becomes job
security, and it's hard after a while to keep your ears open and
your heart in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter died before he could see the groups he had come to admire
receive the money that would help keep them alive. None of the
recipients know who he was, except that he believed in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing that ever happened to us,'' Toro
said. ``We're a good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was fated. Vamos a la Pena is Spanish for ``Let's go
to the rock.'' Toro took it from a Chilean poem that referred to a
rock where people plotted a campaign of resistance. ``Peter,'' too,
means rock. After years of resisting hopelessness on a lonely
journey, Toro is thankful that the rock finally came to him.

TENDING TO WOUNDS OF WAR HE DIDN'T KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brian C. Halpern was 19 years old when the war in
Vietnam ended. He lost no members of his family in the war, nor
does he see much of the legacy of the war in his medical practice.
Halpern is a specialist in sports medicine and a successful one:
he's associate team physician for the Mets, attending physician at
Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery, with an office in New
Jersey and another in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year Halpern, 42, has made three trips to
Vietnam to set up a program in which doctors and physical
therapists from the Hospital for Special Surgery will instruct
doctors at the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern's memories of his first visit to Bach Mai are vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the largest hospitals in Vietnam, and in 1972, in
the Christmas bombings, we destroyed their pediatric ward and
killed all the inhabitants,'' says Halpern, taking the
responsibility on himself. ``It's a 1,000-bed hospital, but there
is more than one patient in a bed. They were making crutches out of
bamboo by hand with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing, certainly. But why does Halpern feel so concerned
about Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could ask why Vietnam and why not the Bronx,'' Halpern
says, skirting the personal. ``My answer is, there's need
everywhere. Also I think the war does have something to do with it.
We demolished this country, we affected a lot of lives. Maybe this
is a way of repairing the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthopedists, some believe, are among the least analytic of
doctors. Their expertise centers upon a concrete framework of
muscle and bones. So, in deference to Dr. Halpern's specialty, the
bare bones of Halpern's life and career:
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Lakewood, N.J., the son of an
obstetrician-gynecologist father and a mother who was an assistant
prosecutor. Graduated Middlebury College in Vermont and Cornell
University Medical School. Founder of the American Medical Society
for Sports Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the aspects of the doctor's life which do not
show up on an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Did the doctor always want to be a doctor? ``No,'' Halpern says.
``I didn't know what I wanted to do. Middlebury was a great liberal
arts school in the middle of ski country, so I could decide what I
wanted to do and ski at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   He hesitates to explain why he went into medicine because ``it's
gonna be really corny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteered on the ambulance up there, we got called out at
5 in the morning to a gas station where one of the attendants had
had a heart attack. I was doing the breathing part, mouth to mouth.
That's a very, uh, intimate thing. The guy didn't make it. I was
very upset, crying. I found myself wandering through the campus
around sunrise, and it turned out to be the most unbelievably
gorgeous day.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern is at a loss to explain how a beautiful sunrise
following a death made him decide to become a doctor. He can only
say he made the decision that morning.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Vietnam is more easily explained. In 1995, Halpern
was the medical director for a 13,000-mile, round-the-world bicycle
trip, sponsored by World Team Sports, a nonprofit organization
based in Charlotte, N.C., which highlights the accomplishments of
disabled athletes. (The Hospital for Special Surgery financed the
medical support for the team.) Halpern rode with the team for six
weeks and found the experience inspiring. But he also wanted to
leave something of permanent medical value.
</P>
<P>
   When the same groups planned a 1,200 mile bicycle trip through
Vietnam for disabled American and Vietnamese veterans last January,
Halpern convinced the Hospital for Special Surgery to train doctors
to establish a muscular-skeletal clinic in Hanoi. Halpern also
accompanied American veterans when they spoke at schools in
Vietnam. He remembers particularly a talk by an American veteran
who had been blinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the kids, `I'm embarrassed to tell you this, but one
thing I remember is running through the rice paddies and shooting
at anything that moved, even if it was a 12-year-old kid who ran up
to me with a gun _ I shot him in the face,''' Halpern recalls. ``He
was crying and so was everybody else and one of the Vietnamese
girls came up to him and gives him a hug and say, `It's okay, the
war is over.' This kind of humanity you don't see in New York. It's
there. I just don't see it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like Halpern, successful, with a wife who is a teacher
and three daughters and a comfortable home in New Jersey, got
something from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go there to get anything,'' he says. ``I went there
to help. I'm very fortunate. It's time for me to give something
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk turns to health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is disabled,'' Halpern says. ``She has been for most
of my life. She had a spinal cord tumor when she was in high school
and then she had multiple surgeries that left her paraplegic. She's
now a Superior Court judge in Ocean County, New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Would it be safe to theorize _ more on the stuff that wouldn't
turn up on an X-ray _ that having a disabled mother gave the doctor
the desire to heal and the need to care?
</P>
<P>
   ``We all are what we were,'' Halpern says. ``You probably
wouldn't be far off.''

JOHNNY ROVENTINI, 86, BELLHOP WHO CALLED FOR PHILLIP MORRIS
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Roventini, the little Brooklyn-born bellhop with the big
bell-clear voice whose ``Call for Phil-lip Mor-ris,'' delighted
radio audiences in the 1930s and '40s and made the cigarette into a
household name, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was
86 and had been under lifetime contract to the company since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was complications from a facial
infection.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Roventini first went on the air for Philip Morris,
on the Ferde Grofe Show on April 17, 1933, until the cigarette
company began to phase him out as a radio and television spokeman
in the early 1950s, Roventini's was one of the most recognizable
voices in the land. And with the picture of the little man in his
bright red, gold-trimmed uniform plastered in store windows and in
magazine ads he was one of the nation's most recognizable figures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company liked to say it discovered him in the lobby
of the New Yorker Hotel, until he became its spokesman the
22-year-old Roventini was more famous than Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 feet tall, he was billed as ``the world's smallest
bellboy,'' and even had his picture on postcards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pituitary gland disorder that halted his development
before his voice changed and left him with a 12-year-old's body for
the rest of his life, but it was his gregarious personality that
helped make Roventini a favorite of the countless singers and other
radio stars he introduced.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1974, Roventini, who never married,
devoted himself to his sports cars and to the cabin cruisers he
kept in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years he had lived with his brother Fred in
Chestnut Ridge, N.Y. His nephew, Philip Roventini, said his uncle,
never more than a light social smoker, had not smoked at all in
recent years but had remained a company man, indifferent to
tobacco's link with health problems.

GOLDEN VENTURE SMUGGLER SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man accused of masterminding the Golden Venture
voyage _ an ill-fated 1993 effort to smuggle hundreds of Chinese
immigrants into the United States on a decrepit freighter _ was
given the maximum prison sentence of 20 years Tuesday. The judge
rejected his expressions of sorrow for the 10 passengers who died
in the journey's calamitous end off the Queens shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and your confederates were not some group of selfless
humanitarians,'' U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi told the
defendant, Lee Peng Fei, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and
other charges in March.
</P>
<P>
   In court in Brooklyn Tuesday, Lee contended that he had sought
to keep many of the immigrants from being stranded in Africa
because of earlier mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The judge saw it differently. ``You were a group of greedy and
indeed immoral men,'' she said, ``who hoped to profit from the
misery of others'' and who crammed nearly 300 people ``like
animals'' in the hold of a ``wretched boat'' that ``you knew was
unfit for human beings in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat lacked adequate water, food, sanitary conditions,
lifeboats and life preservers, on a journey that lacked any plan
for landing its human cargo other than by recklessly grounding the
150-foot boat at night ``and telling the people on board to jump
into the water and swim to shore,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lee, a 46-year-old citizen of Taiwan, told the
judge through an interpreter that he had expressed his sorrow to
those who perished. ``I have special ways to be in contact with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmarish, four-month journey of the Golden Venture began
off the coast of Thailand and wound through the Indian and Atlantic
Oceans. It ended on June 6, 1993, when the freighter was ordered to
run aground on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens and the nearly 300
immigrants aboard were told to swim ashore in the early morning
darkness. Ten of the passengers drowned or died of hypothermia from
the effort, which required a long swim through rough waters because
the ship ended up on a sandbar 200 yards offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants, who had made various down payments to get
aboard, were to pay the rest of the $30,000 fee after they arrived
in the United States. Nearly all of those who made it to shore were
quickly rounded up and many spent up to three and a half years in
American jails after the voyage, which cast a sharp spotlight on
the widespread and lucrative smuggling of Chinese people to
America.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was captured in Thailand in November 1995 _ while
polishing his $89,000 Mercedes-Benz, law enforcement officials said
_ was the 22nd and final defendant to be convicted in the case, and
he received the harshest sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The others, who also pleaded guilty, received sentences ranging
from less than a year to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   With credit for the three years Lee has spent in Thai and
American jails since his arrest, and with the maximum deduction for
good behavior in prison _ another three years _ he could be free in
14 years. The 20-year sentence was far above the 3-year maximum
suggested under federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Raggi noted that the law permitted her to depart from the
guidelines if she found aggravating factors. In this case, she said
those factors included ``dangerous or inhumane treatment'' of the
passengers and deaths that ``were directly caused by your callous
decision'' involving ``grounding the boat at night and having them
swim to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty, Lee, who had not been aboard the ship, said
he had ordered the grounding by telephone from an apartment in
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentencing, Lee sought to withdraw his plea, saying
he had erred at the plea session when he admitted ordering the
grounding on the ocean side of the Rockaway peninsula. He said he
had really ordered the vessel grounded on the Jamaica Bay side,
where the waters are calmer. Raggi rejected the withdrawal motion.

MEXICO TO CANCEL LONG-DISTANCE SURCHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican regulators announced Tuesday that they
would cancel a surcharge that Telefonos de Mexico SA collected from
other long-distance companies to complete calls into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge had drawn accusations of unfair competition from
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mexico stopped short of addressing several issues that
have caused long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom to
slow the once-vigorous pace of their investments in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Lozano Alarcon, president of the Federal
Telecommunications Commission here, said that the 58 percent
surcharge would be eliminated as of Jan. 1. Long-distance companies
that compete with Telefonos de Mexico, known as Telmex, will pay
the equivalent of 2.6 cents a minute for calls from the United
States into Mexico, about the same rate they were paying before the
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom had protested the surcharge especially vigorously,
and earlier this year suspended a $900 million investment to expand
its fiber-optic network in Mexico, saying that regulations here
were giving a clear edge to Telmex.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex had monopolies in both long-distance and local phone
service until early last year, when Mexico opened to long-distance
competition. Telmex is still the monopoly carrier in local service,
but is about to face competition there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom reacted cautiously Tuesday, saying
they needed time to study the measure.

   In the jockeying for congressional committee assignments,
Sen.-elect Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who defeated Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato last month, had asked for a seat on the Senate Banking
Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee. The congressman said
he figured he would be named to one or the other before he moves
from one side of Capitol Hill to the other next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he was named to both. He was also named to the Rules

organization started by the late basketball coach Jim Valvano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote a letter to Darryl saying, `When you're feeling
better, we'd love for you to be a part of it,''' said Melissa
Lawrence, a vice president of the company that makes the ties for
the foundation. ``We got a letter back saying that he wanted to
jump in, and then we received the drawing.'' The $35 tie will go on
sale in March alongside ties based on drawings by other sports
figures, including Mark McGwire and Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His is actually one of the better ones,'' Ms. Lawrence said of
Strawberry's sketch. ``None of these guys are professing to be

   It is not Kennedy's own money, but a grant from the nonprofit
Robin Hood Foundation. He will give the check to Hans Hageman at
the foundation's annual ``heroes award breakfast'' at Tavern on the

private middle school on East 103rd Street; his brother Ivan is the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Hageman, 40, was a classmate of Kennedy at the Collegiate

   NEW YORK _ Almost overnight, the Christmas decorations went up

beneath the vaulted sky ceiling in Grand Central Terminal. Long
strands of tinsel transformed whole buildings into full-size
ornaments. And Tuesday, Yoko Ono unveiled her holiday billboard.
</P>
<P>
   She and John Lennon did the same thing 29 years ago (Broadway at
43rd Street then, Broadway at 47th Street now.) ``War Is Over! If
You Want It'' the billboard says. ``Happy Christmas From John &AMP;
Yoko.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw no reason to change the wording.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I really felt the need to do this was I
went to Belfast recently, and I saw that after the peace treaty,
there was a marked difference,'' she said. ``The locals were
telling me that they were feeling totally frightened before.
There's no fear now.''
</P>
<P>
   How much does a 20-by-60-foot billboard cost?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got the bill yet,'' she said.

UCLA COMES BACK REFRESHED FROM BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA guard Andy Meyers had an ideal Thanksgiving.
He ate three turkey dinners, gained about 10 pounds, dominated the
couch and watched every football game he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole weekend was a food festival,'' he said, grinning.
``My eyes hurt because I watched more football in four days than I
watched film all season.''
</P>
<P>
   One worry interrupted Meyers' fowl and football bliss: What if
four days off was too much? Would the Bruins return to practice
Monday sluggish and sloppy and unprepared for the monumental game
at Miami?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking to myself, `Four days off is a long time,'''
Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked into UCLA's weight room Monday morning, Meyers
got the answer he was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was fired up,'' he said. ``We were thinking about
Miami, and people were ready to practice. We were away just enough
to feel good, for our knees and bodies to feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long, pressure-filled season, Thanksgiving gave UCLA the
respite it needed before a grueling stretch, what with Miami, final
exams and the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Sunday, I was anxious to play football again, and I hadn't
felt that way all year,'' tight end Mike Grieb said.
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're frisky,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Rain gang: UCLA practiced in the rain Tuesday for the first time
this season, but there was some dispute about previous rain
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo thought the last rain practice was in 1995, before the
USC game, while kicker Chris Sailer claimed it was last year,
before Washington. Either way, the players seemed to enjoy
themselves. Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo finished practice with a
head-first slide, caking himself in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned with alignments and assignments, but it's
hard to throw and catch and keep your footing,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami update: The Hurricanes are without their top receiver,
Reggie Wayne, who will miss the rest of the season with a knee
injury. Wayne led the Hurricanes in receptions (42) and yards (629)
before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in
practice last week.

   Mr. Motivation? Three weeks ago, Toledo criticized defensive
coordinator Nick Aliotti for using a scheme that he felt was too
complicated and relied too heavily on man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti, who worked with Toledo at Oregon in 1988, was surprised
and stung by the remarks, but they apparently made an impact. After
miserable performances against Stanford and Oregon State, the
Bruins held Washington and USC to 24 and 17 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did simplify, and we put in some zone,'' Toledo
said. ``Part of my job as a head coach is to motivate. You've got
to motivate players, and sometimes you have to motivate coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakness-of-schedule: Quarterback Cade McNown believes
strength-of-schedule is a flawed component in the Bowl Championship
Series formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is it's up to the athletic director, five or
seven years ago, to pick the right teams,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Reserve receiver Jon Dubravac has a strained
hamstring and has not practiced this week. He's questionable for
Miami. Reserve tight end Randy Hakes had an appendectomy last week
and will not play.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even President Clinton concedes that he did not
tell the whole truth about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
But did he commit perjury under the definition of the law?
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House of Representatives over whether to impeach
Clinton could turn on how this question is answered. The consensus
of Republicans in Congress is that he clearly perjured himself, and
many say it is the charge on which they are most confident they can
muster a majority for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the evidence is most compelling,'' said Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla., a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
``That will be the major focus'' of articles of impeachment, Canady
added.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats say that even if the president did lie under oath
about a sexual relationship, it is insufficient grounds for
impeachment. At Tuesday's committee hearing, some offered a new
line of defense, saying Republicans had failed to prove that
Clinton had perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had called the hearing to emphasize that perjury is
an important crime. The federal perjury laws require prosecutors to
prove that offenders ``knowingly'' lied under oath and that the
lies were ``material'' to the cases in which the false testimony
was given.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Clinton and some Democrats at Tuesday's hearing
maintain that he did not commit perjury because his sworn
statements, however misleading, were literally true on all
important matters. They said that either he believed his denials to
be true, testified that he could not recall something or had
recollections at odds with other witnesses. At worst, they said,
this would be misleading, but not deliberately false.
</P>
<P>
   In his public address on Aug. 17, Clinton conceded that he did
have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was inappropriate and
wrong and that his statements about it had been misleading. But the
president also said his answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones
case last January, when he denied having sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky, were ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has held that intentionally misleading
statements do not amount to perjury. In a 1973 case (Bronston vs.
United States), the court ruled that perjury had not occurred when
this testimony was given under oath by a witness who maintained a
Swiss bank account for five years but closed it:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Switzerland?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever?
</P>
<P>
   A. The company had an account there for about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans working on drafting articles of impeachment say say
they are generally following the lines established by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In his report to Congress, Starr
cited these five instances when, he maintained, the president had
lied under oath:
</P>
<P>
   1. In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied he had
engaged in a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   2. He made similar denials to the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   3. In the civil deposition, he said he could not remember being
alone in the White House with Ms. Lewinsky or giving her presents.
</P>
<P>
   4. In the deposition, he said he had not had a detailed
conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about her testimony in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   5. In the deposition, he said he did not remember whether his
friend Vernon Jordan Jr. had talked with Ms. Lewinsky about the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics agree that the strongest cases can be made in
the first three. The facts in these cases are not in dispute, only
the interpretation. Here are the details:
</P>
<P>
   1. When the president gave his deposition in the Jones case on
Jan. 17, this definition of ``sexual relations'' was agreed on: ``A
person engages in `sexual relations' when the person knowingly
engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ... `Contact'
means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked: ``Have you ever had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined?''
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told the federal grand jury about 10 encounters she
had with Clinton that involved intimate contact but not
intercourse. In his grand jury testimony, he took the view that his
statement in the deposition had been accurate because sexual
relations occurred only with sexual intercourse. As for oral sex,
he said, ``If the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed
on him, then the contact is ... not with anything on that list but
with the lips of another person.''
</P>
<P>
   2. When Clinton went before the grand jury on Aug. 17,
prosecutors bore in on the question of whether he had touched Ms.
Lewinsky in the designated areas.
</P>
<P>
   This was one exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Q. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval
Office area you touched her breasts, would she be lying?
</P>
<P>
   A. That is not my recollection. My recollection is that I did
not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After some back-and-forth, the questioning continued, as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   Q. So touching in your view then and now _ the person being
deposed touching or kissing the breast of another person would fall
within the definition?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct, sir.
</P>
<P>
   And moments later, there was this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   A. You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not
have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Including touching her breast, kissing her breast, touching
her genitalia?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   3. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone with Clinton in the
Oval Office many times.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself told the grand jury that he ``was alone
with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in
early 1997.'' He also acknowledged to the grand jury that he and
Ms. Lewinsky had exchanged gifts, a fact corroborated by
considerable evidence. That contradicted his answers to questions
in his sworn deposition in the Jones case about being alone with
Ms. Lewinsky. In the deposition, Clinton claimed a lack of memory.
</P>
<P>
   This was one exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Q. At any time, were you and Monica Lewinsky together in the
Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall.
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to say that they might have been alone
incidentally when she brought papers to him to sign or dropped off
material.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they had been alone in the hallway where Ms.
Lewinsky said some of the sexual encounters occurred, Clinton
responded: ``I don't believe so, unless we were walking back to the
back dining room with the pizza. I just don't remember. I don't
believe we were alone in the hallway, no.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of gifts, he had this exchange with the Jones
lawyers:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall. Do you know what they were?
</P>
<P>
   Q. A hat pin?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember. But I certainly could have.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A book about Walt Whitman?
</P>
<P>
   A. I give people a lot of gifts, and when people are around, I
give a lot of things I have at the White House away. So I could
have given her a gift, but I don't remember a specific gift.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can read these questions and answers without
concluding that Clinton lied. But that does not mean, under law,
that he committed perjury.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Toledo, UCLA's third choice to replace Terry
Donahue three years ago, was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year on
Tuesday, conference commissioner Tom Hansen announced.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has directed the Bruins to 20 consecutive victories and
is one win from a probable date in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, UCLA became the fourth team in the Pac-10 era (since
1978) to finish unbeaten and untied in conference play _ following
USC (1988), Washington (1991) and Arizona State (1996).
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came one day after eight Bruins were selected
to the All-Pac-10 team, including quarterback Cade McNown, who was
named co-offensive player of the year.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE NBA is enjoying one of its most competitive seasons, even
though, as you may have noticed, there hasn't been so much as a
practice game in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a 6-10 guy just signed a contract for more than $13
million a year, which is not bad for a fellow so skinny Shaquille
O'Neal could snap him like a matchstick just by leaning on him. So
in the absence of an actual game, you congratulate Randy Johnson
for at least reminding fans of the scent of NBA money.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't great enough, Clyde Drexler has won three of
his first five games as the rookie head coach of the Houston
Cougars, including victories over Texas and LSU. The really sweet
part is the fact The Glide has no reason to feel any regrets, or
any withdrawal symptoms, because he hasn't missed anything. In
truth, if Clyde had only foreseen the lockout, he could have stayed
with the Rockets for another year and still coached the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   What is really strange about the standoff between the players
and owners is how calmly the masses have accepted it. Perhaps they
understand that this is a war between the privileged and the
overprivileged, and in the end, the NBA can settle this beef in
January and still squeeze in six months of hoops, including all of
the only season that counts, the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Randy Johnson and how the Astros will
replace him, or not. The obvious, unemotional answer to that
question is that they would have won 92 games without him and still
perished in the first round of the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was swell to have Johnson racking up 10 wins against one
loss and toying with the minds of opposing teams. Having Johnson's
name in the pitching matchups was like keeping a werewolf in your
refrigerator. They make terrific watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will miss that fear factor, although we must admit
the Padres coped with it nicely, beating Johnson twice in tightly
pitched games. But we don't recall any visiting teams drooling at
the prospect of facing the rest of Houston's staff _ Shane
Reynolds, Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and Sean Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, will
continue his record of shrewd Christmas shopping and pick up
another ace from the as-is counter. Or simply one who has grown
disenchanted with his current team and needs a roof over his head
while waiting for another club to offer him a blank check.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, and how we adore that phrase, is this: The
Astros survived the loss of Darryl Kile, who chose the thin air of
Colorado, and they will survive their brief love affair with the
Big Unit, who went for the dry air of Arizona and a map to the Lost
Dutchman's gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the Astros tried to woo him with table scraps.
They can, in fact, take the $11 million annual salary they saved by
not signing the scary lefthander and buy an entire outfield. Or
their own special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would have been nice if Randy had wanted to stay
here, if he had liked Houston nearly as much as money. No one can
fault the effort he gave here, or his manners. He was surprisingly
modest and pleasant and grateful for the affection the fans showed
him. For all his talents, he made no waves. He wasn't one of those
haunted souls who can cross an intersection and make cars behind
him crash head-on.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can't sign someone to replace him, because there
isn't a pitcher out there who fits his description. You don't find
many southpaws who can hurl that 100-mph lightning and who
intimidate hitters without having to pitch inside.
</P>
<P>
   Offhand, we don't recall anyone accusing Johnson of being a
headhunter. You wonder what damage he might do if he had the
temperament of a Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson or Rob Dibble. Drysdale,
who was the righthanded enforcer for the Dodgers when Sandy Koufax
was their lefthanded genius, made life miserable for a lot of
hitters. He still holds the record for most hit batsmen in a
career, 154. It is a record that may last longer than Mark
McGwire's, because the umpires won't eject a player for hitting
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The game has undergone a sweeping change in this area. The umps
will banish a pitcher on suspicion of throwing inside. Drysdale,
and even the sweet-tempered Nolan Ryan, considered it a sign of
respect when they made a batter bite the dust.
</P>
<P>
   We will do Reynolds no service if we expect him to make us
forget Randy Johnson. But he has a touch of temper and the talent
to move up in class. Reynolds won 19 games last season, and that _
and a name like Shane _ will qualify you as the ace on most
pitching staffs.

BRUINS TIE CANUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They weren't particularly happy. They weren't satisfied.
However, sometimes earning a point is enough. The fact is, the
Bruins are unbeaten in six games (4-0-2) after Tuesday night's 1-1
tie with the Vancouver Canucks at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The game wasn't pretty. But the Bruins are 6-1-4 in their last
11, and there weren't many complaints in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came hard,'' said defenseman Kyle McLaren. ``It took us a
while to respond, but we were lucky to have a goal and hold on. I
don't think anybody here is satisfied with the way we played. If we
play our best, we probably would've won that game. We had too many
bad plays all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a point. It keeps our unbeaten streak alive. We move on
and look forward to Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have gone to overtime in five of their last 10
contests, going 1-0-4 in them. If anyone felt as if there were a
victory here, it was the Canucks, who were mired in a five-game
losing streak and hadn't gotten a point since Nov. 19, when they
beat Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is missing its scoring punch with Alexander Mogilny
out with a knee injury, Todd Bertuzzi sitting out with a broken
leg, and disgruntled star Pavel Bure refusing to play while he
awaits a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canucks came out hard in the early going, pressuring
Boston and limiting the Bruins to four shots in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier got Vancouver on the board first with his 10th goal
of the season at 13:27. Markus Naslund dished an off-balance pass
to Messier in front, and Messier directed it past goalie Byron
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:56 of the second period, Dave Scatchard was called for
high-sticking, but the Bruins couldn't convert. Just 12 seconds
after the power play expired, the Canucks thought they had a second
goal when Scatchard went right from the penalty box to the crease,
putting the puck past Dafoe after taking a pass from Trent Klatt.
However, Scatchard was so blatantly in the crease that he might as
well have been wearing goalie pads, and the score was nullified.
</P>
<P>
   With 29 seconds left in the period, the Bruins tied the game on
Sergei Samsonov's ninth goal of the year. Samsonov had the puck in
the far right circle and tried to pass to Dmitri Khristich in the
slot. Khristich was tied up by Brad May, and the puck pinballed to
Chris Taylor in the slot. Taylor got a whack at it before Samsonov
swooped in and buried the rebound past Garth Snow.
</P>
<P>
   And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take the point, but I don't think we're satisfied with
it,'' said Ray Bourque. ``I don't think we played very well. We had
spurts, but overall, it wasn't a very good game. We played better
as the game went on, but that first half of the game wasn't our
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to react the way we wanted to. When you get
pressured like that, sometimes you think you don't have as much
time as you do and you start throwing the puck around and you get
bottled up in your end for the whole shift and you're scrambling
and it's just chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're being checked like that, you have to pick up the
skating and intensity and start bumping and taking over that part
of the game. We knew what was coming. I don't think we reacted well
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns said it might not have been great, but he
didn't like the fact the team was booed at the end. Some nights, he
said, it just isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the most we've ever been hit by an opposing team,
but we knew that,'' said Burns. ``These guys are on a long road
trip and they haven't won a game. They're not going to come in here
and roll over and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and hit us pretty hard. We fought back and got a
point out of it. We got booed for it. I don't think we deserve to
be booed _ we've lost one game out of our last 11. I don't think we
deserve any criticism tonight.''

MASSACHUSETTS UPSET BY CHARLESTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. _ This much is safe to say: The
University of Massachusetts doesn't need a couple of days off. The
25th-ranked Minutemen entered Tuesday night's contest against the
College of Charleston after a 13-day hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of coach Bruiser Flint's tireless emphasis before
and during that break that his team must come to play for 40
minutes in every outing, it appears only one player has gotten the
message.
</P>
<P>
   With his 34-point performance, guard Monty Mack showed Tuesday
night he is ready to lead the Minutemen. Whether his teammates
follow his lead will determine whether they stop losing winnable
games: Charleston's 77-75 victory over UMass Tuesday night proved
again that one player can't do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's point total _ which included 21 in the second half _ was
a career high and the most scored against Charleston since Feb. 3,
1993. He put UMass up, 36-32, with a 3-pointer at the halftime
buzzer and almost single-handedly kept UMass (1-2) from being blown
out late in the contest with three 3-pointers over the last 2:03.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' said an irate Flint. ``Monty's not the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was a lack of support. UMass center and NBA prospect
Lari Ketner, last season's leading scorer, was a virtual no-show: 5
points, 1-for-2 shooting, 0 rebounds, 1 block.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward Ajmal Basit had 9 points and 7 rebounds but played
just 16 minutes because of foul trouble. The rest of the UMass
rotation was 10 for 26 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, center Jody Lumpkin had 22 points and 7 boards to
lead four players in double figures for Charleston (3-1), which
also appeared inept at times yet outrebounded the much taller
Minutemen, 39-27, and outhustled the visitors most of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's final trey, with 18 seconds left, got UMass within 2 at
74-72. After a Charleston free throw, UMass guard Charlton Clarke,
who scored 8 of his 10 points in the final minute, sank two free
throws to make it a 1-point game, 75-74.
</P>
<P>
   With six seconds left, Carlos Brown sank two free throws to put
Charleston back up by 3. Clarke raced up the court and was fouled
as he missed a 3-point attempt with less than a second left, giving
him three shots at the line and a chance to tie. He sank the first
but missed the second and third, and the crowd of 6,772 stormed the
court in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack was sensational in his ability to keep them alive,'' said
Charleston coach John Kresse. ``He kept them right in the game
until the clock show 0.2 seconds. Not until that time did I feel
the game was possibly over.''
</P>
<P>
   So disgusted was Flint that he said he might shake up the
rotation before Saturday's game against Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would bench Ketner, Flint said, ``We'll see. He
guarded himself. He was awful. He stunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys, they need to do some soul-searching. I'm tired of
watching this.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mack, this marked the third consecutive game he has
showed signs of leadership. He had a game-high 24 points in the
season-opening win over Niagara and tied for the team high with 15
points in the Nov. 18 loss to St. John's. Other parts of his game

   ``I think I came ready to play,'' said Mack. ``I know I made
some mistakes and the whole team made mistakes but I came ready to
play and I made the shots I took.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not mentally tough yet,'' said Mack. ``As soon as
someone does something wrong, we get down. As soon as we stop that,
we'll be ready to play.''

U.S. TO RELEASE SECRET PAPERS ON PINOCHET

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treading into a political and diplomatic
confrontation it tried to avoid, the United States decided on
Tuesday to declassify some secret government documents on the
killing and torture conducted by the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, whose predecessor was the target of American coup
plots.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup against President Salvador
Allende, who had been the target of American plots.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release such documents is the first sign that
the United States will cooperate in the case against Pinochet.
Clinton administration officials said they believed the benefits of
openness in human rights cases outweighed the risks to national
security in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision could open ``a can of worms,'' in the words of
a former CIA official stationed in Chile, exposing the depth of the
knowledge that the United States had about the crimes of the
Pinochet government.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA worked closely with Chile's secret police in the 1970s,
at the time of the Pinochet regime's worst human-rights abuses,
which included more than 3,000 killings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83 years old and a senator for life in Chile, ruled
from 1973 to 1990. He stepped down as commander in chief of the
Chilean armed forces earlier this year. He was arrested in London
on a Spanish court's warrant in October. The court wants to try him
for human rights abuses in the deaths of Spanish and other
citizens. Last week, Britain's highest court denied him the
immunity he had claimed as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred uneasiness in American diplomatic and
intelligence circles. While some European government officials have
supported bringing the former dictator to court, U.S. officials
have largely stayed silent, reflecting skepticism about the Spanish
court's power, doubts about international tribunals aimed at former
foreign rulers, and worries over the implications for American
leaders who might someday also be accused in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who served as his
national security adviser and secretary of state, supported a
right-wing coup in Chile in the early 1970s, previously
declassified documents show.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the actions of the United States during the 1973
coup, and much of what American leaders and intelligence services
did in liaison with the Pinochet government after it seized power,
remain under the seal of national security.
</P>
<P>
   The secret files on the Pinochet regime are held by the CIA, the
Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon,
the National Security Council, the National Archives, the
presidential libraries of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department records, these files contain a
history of human rights abuses and international terrorism:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1975, State Department diplomats in Chile protested the
Pinochet regime's record of killing and torture, filing dissents to
American foreign policy with their superiors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA has files on assassinations by the regime and the
Chilean secret police. The intelligence agency also has records on
Chile's attempts to establish an international right-wing
covert-action squad.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Ford library contains many of Kissinger's secret files on
Chile, which never have been made public. Through a secretary,
Kissinger declined a request for an interview on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish court asked the Justice Department to review and
release the documents under a legal assistance treaty between the
United States and Spain. The treaty gives the United States broad
discretion to produce or withhold classified documents from the
court, but Clinton administration officials said they believed the
benefits of openness in human rights cases outweighed the risks to
national security in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human
Rights Watch in New York. ``The proof will be what documents we
finally get, how useful they are, and how long it takes to get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This should not be a pretext for not having a policy
on the need to bring to Pinochet to justice for the thousands of
murders and disappearances committed during his rule. The United
States' silence on that question is being interpreted all over the
world as passive support for impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens were killed by Pinochet's forces _ among them
Ronni Moffitt, a 25-year-old researcher blown up by a car bomb a
mile from the White House in 1976, along with a former Chilean
foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, and Charles Horman, a
31-year-old film maker, writer and human-rights activist murdered
during the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has been officially silent on the question of
bringing the former dictator to justice for those crimes, publicly
deferring to the Spanish, British and Chilean courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials, speaking on the condition that they would
not be quoted directly or by name, said that they had deep concerns
about the idea that a Spanish judge could reach across
international borders and try a former foreign leader. They said
the United States had opposed the idea of a permanent international
tribunal for crimes against humanity for the same reasons that
officials are queasy about the Pinochet case. They said they feared
that U.S. officials might be accused by foreign judges looking into
the deaths of citizens in nations where American policy has had
violent consequences.
</P>
<P>
   France, Switzerland and Belgium have joined Spain in seeking
Pinochet's extradition for crimes committed against their citizens.
But no senior U.S. official has addressed Pinochet's role as a
dictatorial leader who shared some goals and some enemies with
Washington when he took power 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in accountability and we are heartened by calls for
accountability in Chile,'' said the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin. ``We also believe in Chile's democracy. We're not
prepared to say anything publicly beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret files ``may shed light on human rights abuses during
the Pinochet era,'' Rubin said. ``We will declassify and make
public as much information as possible consistent with our laws and
national security.'' A CIA spokesman echoed the latter remark.
</P>
<P>
   Declassifying the documents could take months, as government
officials review them page by page, blacking out sensitive
information, like the names of spies, before they release them.
Some documents may be withheld entirely, and some published only in
part.

<P>
   The role of the United States in trying to stop the 1970
election of Allende, a Marxist, as Chile's president, and to
organize a coup against the newly elected president that same year,
is well-known. But its role in the 1973 coup that succeeded in
deposing the Allende government, and its subsequent support for the
Pinochet junta, remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Secret American efforts to overthrow Allende ``never really
ended,'' a chief of CIA covert operations at the time, Thomas
Karamessines, later told Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little or no documentation of those efforts after
1970, and some former officials say the United States did not play
a direct role in the 1973 coup. ``The CIA had nothing to do with
that coup,'' said the former CIA official who served in Chile.
``But it wasn't a complete surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency records on the regime's
secret police may help answer a question Horman's and Ms. Moffitt's
survivors have been asking for more than 20 years _ what the United
States knew about the killings of Americans and other victims of
the Pinochet regime.

COMMENTARY: HANKERING FOR A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Kurt Andersen's name in 6th and 16th grafs)  (rl) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tom Hanks will have some explaining to do before we
elect him president.
</P>
<P>
   We'll want to know if he enjoyed wearing that dress in ``Bosom
Buddies.'' We'll want to know exactly what happened under the
blanket with that stewardess in ``Nothing in Common.'' We'll want
to know what possessed the man who went to the moon to moon in the
December Vogue. We'll want to know whether he is truly contrite
about making ``Turner and Hooch.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, he would have definite assets as a
candidate. He served in World War II, Vietnam and the Peace Corps.
He brought Apollo 13 back safely. He learned about suffering in
``Philadelphia.'' He got that magic handshake from JFK in ``Forrest
Gump.'' And he has a catchy campaign slogan: ``Life is like a box
of chocolates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeepers, creepers, as Hanks likes to say, why not? In Washington
we've had no one to root for in a very long time. A faux hero would
be better than no hero. We have a groupie for president. Why not
have a star?
</P>
<P>
   Hanks made big news this week when he dissed his pal the
president in The New Yorker, noting that there was a time, after
Clinton confessed about Monica, when he regretted giving money to
the Clinton defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   He also mused about running, e-mailing the writer Kurt Andersen:
``The actual ideology that anyone can glean as projected by my
appearances on TV is good because we are all so different and
respecting each other is not so hard a thing to do. Not a bad
platform, I suppose, to run for some office.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his comments caused a sensation, with some TV reporters
acting as though he held the fate of the Democratic Party in his
hands, Hanks showed his true potential as a pol. He gave the
illusion of backpedaling. He stressed he was still a fervent
Clinton supporter, but noted, ``for a moment or so I might have
questioned my original intentions'' in giving to the legal fund.
</P>
<P>
   A slap from Tom Hanks must sting the president more than a slap
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before, it was pols who lectured Hollywood about setting a bad
moral example. Now an actor renowned as a decent guy and cozy
family man was lecturing Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking reversal. It used to be that Hollywood was
drawn to Washington's issues, and Washington to Hollywood's sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, stars looked on politicians as fundamentally more
serious than them, but now they consider politicians just as
superficial and cynical as anyone else,'' said Ron Brownstein, the
L.A. Times columnist who wrote ``The Power and the Glitter.''
``Politicians now get into the type of sex scandals stars used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Drenched in celebrity, Washington has adopted the code of the
entertainment capital: If you're famous enough, the rules don't
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton completed the merger of show biz and politics begun
by Joe Kennedy, impresario of illusion and glamour, and continued
by Ronald Reagan. His White House is all about ratings, and
Hollywood types respect his ability to defy the critics and
consistently get boffo box office.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood will soon realize: Why give millions to prop up
Democratic candidates when it can field its own?
</P>
<P>
   With President Hanks, at least the stars sleeping in the Lincoln
Bedroom would be real friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a New Yorker piece last February called
``Entertainer-in-Chief,'' Andersen wrote that ``politics has become
a kind of low-production-value sub-genre of show business, engaging
only when it is entertaining.'' He wrote that Clinton benefited
from the Lewinsky affair the same way a tired TV drama does when it
adds a bizarre new plot twist in the sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniel, a Hollywood producer, drolly confirms the
synthesis: ``You see the lust Dick Morris and Chris Matthews have
to be on TV, and it's as if they're on `Hollywood Squares.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ross, a writer-director whose hits include ``Big,''
``Dave'' and ``Pleasantville,'' agreed: ``When you see how good
Henry Hyde is at farce, why shouldn't Tom Hanks go into politics?
He's our Jimmy Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has increased our appetite for entertainment
to the point where we may not even be satisfied with Tom Hanks the
person. We may need to go all the way and elect Tom Hanks the
character.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee voted along party
lines to issue new subpoenas related to President Clinton's
campaign finances, the top House Democrat called on Republican
leaders Tuesday to rein in the impeachment proceedings and ``bring
us out of the chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Stating a view held even by some Republicans, Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of Missouri asserted that a leadership vacuum had
developed at the critical final stage in the House impeachment
inquiry because of the transition of power from Speaker Newt
Gingrich to Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot deal with something as grave and important as
impeachment without some common-sense process that everyone
understands,'' Gephardt said in a news conference, where he
announced he was sending a letter to Livingston. ``No one seems to
be in charge. No one seems to be grabbing the reins.'' He called
for some Republican leader to ``drive this train to a certain
outcome that everybody in the country understands and believes is a
fair process.'' Gephardt said he was writing to Gingrich and
Livingston to ask them to take a more forceful role.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, Livingston's spokesman, said, ``We haven't seen
the letter yet. They are entitled to their opinion.'' Christina
Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said ``there is a legislative
procedure already under way'' in the Judiciary Committee.'' And
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the committee chairman, said
Gephardt's real concern was that his committee was ``getting to the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans close to different factions in the House
leadership described a situation in which neither Gingrich nor
Livingston necessarily wanted to preside over the impeachment vote.
A Republican congressman close to Livingston said the new speaker
viewed his leadership as beginning in January and ``he's really
staying studiously out of this.'' The Republican, who spoke on the
condition that he not be identified, said, ``Frankly, there's no
upside for the new speaker. This is on Newt Gingrich's watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Republican close to the departing Gingrich camp said,
``There is a school of thought that perhaps the first great act Bob
Livingston does as speaker is end the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's appeals were echoed by Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee, who called throughout a daylong hearing into
the consequences of perjury for a bipartisan move to censure
Clinton instead of impeaching him. The Democrats sharply protested
the committee's 20-15 vote along party lines to issue four
subpoenas that moved the inquiry beyond the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and into his campaign
fund-raising.

 WASHINGTON: campaign fund-raising. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The committee called for FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles La
Bella, a former Justice Department prosecutor, to be deposed about
their recommendations that Attorney General Janet Reno name an
independent counsel to look into the president's 1996 campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   It also subpoenaed the two men's memorandums to Ms. Reno making
their case and several Justice Department analyses of their
reports. And it subpoenaed Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for
any documents related to John Huang, the Democratic fund-raiser who
had raised most of the questionable donations that the Democratic
Party later returned. But overnight the committee's Republicans
dropped plans to seek documents about several other Democratic
fund-raising figures and to subpoena the president, too, in a
demand that he direct Reno to produce the memos.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that despite the new tack he still hoped his committee
could complete its inquiry this month. But he said the memos the
committee sought had been ``kept in a deep freeze'' and that
``we're going to take a look.'' He said, ``We are not participating
in a wild goose chase.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans also acknowledged that if they found new
evidence they wanted to pursue that their timetable could slip, and
for the first time there was rumbling among senior House Republican
aides that the House could put off a vote on any proposed articles
of impeachment until January _ and possibly hand it to the new
106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long been intrigued by the memos submitted by
La Bella and Freeh, and have been critical of Reno's failure to
name an independent counsel to look into the 1996 fund raising.
Just this week she declined to name such a counsel to investigate
Vice President Al Gore and she faces a deadline of next week on
whether to appoint one to look into allegations that Clinton
violated the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Two other congressional committee chairmen, Sen. Orrin Hatch of
the Judiciary Committee and Rep. Dan Burton of the Government
Reform and Oversight Committee, have sought in vain to obtain the
unedited copies of the documents. Hyde also tried to gain access to
the unedited memos earlier in his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, in response to a request from the Justice
Department, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson issued a
sealed ruling holding that there was not sufficient need for the
House Judiciary Committee to have access to the unedited memos,
which contain secret grand jury information. But having now issued
a subpoena, committee Republicans plan to make their own case
before the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the committee Republicans, said
they were interested in the memos because they ''may contain
allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the President.'' He did not
specify further.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans said that with the committee set to
begin drafting articles of impeachment against the president next
week, they doubted they would find anything substantial in the
memos to pursue. ``My expectation level is low about what we're
going to find,'' said Rep. W. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., ``but it's
important to take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., said the committee was simply curious
because Congress had never seen the full memos. ``The mystery begs
for a solution,'' he said, ``and begs for a look see.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats today questioned the committee's new course. ``This is
the last desperate gasp of a group of people who were determined to
impeach the president and haven't yet gotten their way,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion of the inquiry prompted the White House to say it was
reconsidering whether to send the president's lawyers or other
representatives to appear before the committee to present Clinton's
case next week.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the White House
might ask for more time to prepare. ``I think what we're going to
do is we're going to wait for some sort of communication from the
committee of what they're interested in getting from us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart noted that investigations of the 1996 campaign had been
going on in Congress for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a bad rerun of a show that nobody wanted to watch
the first time,'' he said. He said the day's developments had
confirmed the president's decision not to appear before the
committee in person. ``You know I think anyone who watched the
proceedings over the last few hours would understand why the
president of the United States has no business in that room,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it takes another new tack, the committee is expected to
vote toward the end of next week on as many as three articles of
impeachment against the president. At least one article, on
perjury, is considered certain to win committee approval on a
strict party line vote.
</P>
<P>
   It remains far from clear whether there is support in the full
House to impeach the president, with a wavering group of moderate
Republicans likely to decide Clinton's fate. No party leaders are
methodically counting votes, making it harder than usual to
determine the mood of the House, but the vote on an article of
impeachment on perjury is generally considered too close to call.
